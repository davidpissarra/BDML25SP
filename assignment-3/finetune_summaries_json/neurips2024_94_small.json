Flood prediction models are critical to operationalize Early Warning Systems (EWS). We propose two different models to feed into an EWS. The first model will leverage statistical machine learning approaches to predict flood or no flood events on a 0.25 x 0.25 degree scale (approximately 30 km x 30 km in Kenya) using ERA5 features as well as land cover and Digital Terrain Model (DTM) data. This first model will also be used to create a baseline prediction benchmark across the entire country of Kenya. The second model will leverage pre-trained remote sensing based models to generate segmented flood or no flood data on a fine spatial scale. This will increase the number of validation points by a factor of 1000, which opens the door to deep learning approaches to predict flood or no-flood events on a 30 meter x 30 meter spatial scale. We hope that this approach of leveraging pre-trained models to generate fine scale validation data can eventually be used widely in other extreme climate event forecasting scenarios given the scarcity of historical extreme climate events compared to normal weather events. 1 Introduction Kenya’s vulnerability to natural disasters, particularly flooding, has always been a significant chal- lenge. In the first half of 2020 alone, floods claimed over 200 lives, displaced over 100,000 individuals, caused billions of Kenyan shillings in damage, and affected 36 out of 47 counties [ 1]. Similarly, in 2024, severe flooding again devastated the country, displacing thousands and causing widespread economic disruption in 42 counties. Despite these events, Kenya still lacks a comprehensive national Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.flood risk management framework [ 2], making this national scale modeling even more impactful compared to focusing modeling on countries with robust disaster management systems. The demand for more accurate and timely flood forecasts has prompted the development of advanced machine learning approaches. These leverage a wide variety of predictors such as historical ERA5 data, river flow measurements, and geological conditions to enhance flood prediction capabilities. However, the use of these technologies in Kenya’s specific environmental and climate setting is relatively unexplored. This paper intends to fill this gap by proposing approaches customized for Kenya’s sparse and coarse data. By focusing on local data and conditions, this project seeks to improve the ability of municipalities and authorities to predict and respond to floods more effectively. Through improved forecasting, this initiative supports broader climate adaptation efforts and contributes to the resilience of the most vulnerable Kenyans. 2 Related Approaches Flood prediction using machine learning has been a well-explored topic. Some promising models for predicting the occurrence of floods based on predictors like precipitation and temperature in South East Asia include Support Vector Machines, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor approaches, and Fully Connected Neural Networks [ 3].A review paper from 2018 established a trend of deep learning based approaches and also noted that leveraging physically based models required significant expertise yet failed at short term predictions [ 4]. Statistical approaches have also shown promising results in flood prediction along the Ganga river in India. [5]. Significant work has also been done on segmenting flood, permanent water, or no-water pixels on flooded areas using earth observation satellites. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data from Sentinel-1 and optical data from Sentinel-2 were used to create the Sen1Floods11 dataset, enabling deep learning-based flood modeling [ 6]. IBM’s Prithvi-100M, a geospatial foundation model, was fine-tuned on Sentinel-2 data for flood segmentation. [7]. These approaches show potential, but challenges remain, particularly in data scarcity to accurately predict at a national scale in Kenya. 3 Proposed Approach The main contributions of this proposal paper are: •To develop a performance benchmark at the spatial scale of ERA5 on one time step ahead flood prediction in Kenya. •Demonstrate that existing geospatial foundation models can be used to generate extensive fine-scale validation data compared to current flood databases so that the number of val- idation points approaches the number of model parameters in deep learning prediction methods. The Darthmouth Flood Observatory (DFO) from the University of Colorado has over 3,000 flood events recorded worldwide between 1996 - 2018. Of those, 50 flood events are in Kenya. Observations of flood events in Kenya specifically are therefore spatially and temporally sparse. They are denoted in the DFO as a single latitude and longitude point. At a high level, we first plan to extract relevant predictors and use that to predict flood or no flood events on a coarse 0.25 x 0.25 degree grid one time step ahead. The results from this first approach will be used as a performance baseline in Kenya and also\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
