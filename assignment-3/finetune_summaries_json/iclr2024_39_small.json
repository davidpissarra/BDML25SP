However, the absence of systematic knowledge summary remains a challenge for further development of sustainable building materials. This work offers a cost- efficient strategy for information extraction tasks in complex terminology settings using small (2.8B) large language models (LLMs) with well-designed instruction- completion schemes and fine-tuning strategies, introducing a dataset cataloging civil engineering applications of alternative materials. The Multiple Choice in- struction scheme significantly improves model accuracies in entity inference from non-Noun-Phrase sources, with supervised fine-tuning benefiting from straightfor- ward tokenized representations of choices. We also demonstrate the utility of the dataset by extracting valuable insights into promising applications of alternative materials from knowledge graph representations. 1 I NTRODUCTION Concrete production is a major contributor to industrial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, consti- tuting 8-9% of the global CO 2emissions (Ellis et al., 2020). As construction projects drive eco- nomic growth, the urgency to decarbonize building material consumption intensifies, necessitating a sustainable shift to alternative or secondary materials crucial for combating climate change as the majority of emissions are process- instead of energy-related. (Bela ¨ıd, 2022; Miller et al., 2021; Mon- teiro et al., 2017). Previous studies have extensively investigated using processed natural mineral materials (e.g., metakaolin), recycled demolition and construction waste, industrial residues (e.g., silica fume, coal ashes, metallurgical slags), and agricultural and municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) residues to substitute the constituents of concrete according to their characteristics, includ- ing Portland cement, fine aggregate, and coarse aggregate (Juenger et al., 2019; Snellings et al., 2023; Kurniati et al., 2023). The lack of a systematic summary impedes the advancement of commercially viable climate-friendly concrete production and the broader utilization of sustainable construction materials. For a compre- hensive exploration of alternative material possibilities in construction for the decarbonization goals, an exhaustive literature review is indispensable to enrich the knowledge base of the applications and offer optimal recommendations for substitution mixture. Achieving this task is time- and labour- consuming both manually and through traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods that rely on massive labeling. Therefore, we propose to leverage large language models (LLM) for the literature mining task to efficiently address this complexity. NLP methods have been employed in chemistry and materials research for literature mining across various domains, such as drug discovery ( ¨Ozt¨urk et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), solid-state synthe- sis (He et al., 2020), material discovery (Dunn et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2023; Munjal et al., 2023; Walker et al., 2023) etc. Despite the breadth of topics covered, previous studies have predominantly focused on named-entity recognition (NER) and relation extraction (RE) for molecules character- 1Accepted to ICLR 2024 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning ized by precise chemical compositions and well-defined properties, often with synthetic data.

However, within the concrete realm and particularly in the quest for sustainable strategies, the materials of interest encompass secondary and natural mineral materials, which exhibit highly intricate and variable compositions.
