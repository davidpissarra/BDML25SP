The availability of quality, comparable and decision-useful information is required to assess risks and oppor- tunities later integrated into ﬁnancial decision-making. Particularly, standardized, industry-speciﬁc climate risk metrics and topics can support these efforts. SASB’s latest climate risk technical bulletin introduces three climate-related risks that are ﬁnancially material - physical, transition and regulatory risks - and maps these across industries. The main objective of this work is to create a framework that can analyze climate related risk disclosures using an AI-based tool that automatically extracts and categorizes climate-related risks and related metrics from company disclosures based on SASB’s latest climate risk guidance. This process will help with automating large-scale analysis and add much-needed transparency vis-a-vis the current state of climate-related disclosures, while also assessing how far along companies are currently disclosing information on climate risks relevant to their industry. As it stands, this much needed type of analysis is made mostly manually or using third-party metrics, often opaque and biased, as proxies. In this work, we will ﬁrst create a climate risk dictionary that will be trained on a large amount of climate risk text. By combining climate risk keywords in this dictionary with recent advances in natural language processing (NLP), we will then be able to quantita- tively and qualitatively compare climate risk information in different sectors and industries using a novel climate risk score that will be based on SASB standards. 1 Introduction The importance of effective climate-related ﬁnancial risk information and risk communication is crucial to both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial actors. In its latest Global Risks Report, the World Economic Forum again identiﬁed climate-related risks among the highest likelihood and impact risks of the next ten years [1]. Several frameworks and standards were released to support the development of decision-relevant, climate-related risk disclosures, including Task Force on Climate- related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB), Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) and Climate Disclosure Sustainability Board (CDSB) to name a few. While Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.their overall aim is to improve the availability of quality, comparable and decision-useful information to be integrated into ﬁnancial decision-making, the reality is that disclosures around material risks are not currently readily available in a standardized format, nor are they systematically reported given the voluntary nature of climate-related disclosures in most jurisdictions. In fact, a review of over 800 annual reports from TCFD-supporting companies showed evidence of cherry picking in the selection of corporate disclosures, which generally ignored material risk information, with little improvement in the quality of disclosures following TCFD implementation [2]. Thus, the availability and high level of transparency of climate-related reporting is necessary to assess climate-related exposures and risks, reduce information asymmetry and enable the efﬁcient allocation of ﬁnancial resources. Assessing and managing exposures related to climate risks and opportunities requires industry-tailored disclosures as climate change is likely to materialize differently across industries. As such, SASB’s 2021 Climate Risk Technical Bulletin [3] aims to address one of the most commonly cited challenges in implementing TCFD recommendations: the lack of standardized, industry-speciﬁc climate risk metrics [4]. While a standardized climate-related disclosure framework has yet to be developed, SASB is recognized as a leader in sustainability-related frameworks, and is positioning itself to play a key role in the future of standardization of climate-related disclosure. It is therefore critical to consider SASB carefully. Further, the expectation of an industry-speciﬁc climate-risk disclosure framework like SASB’s ESG disclosure framework is highly relevant as it could be used as “a practical tool for companies to use when implementing the TCFD’s principles-based recommendations”1. The framework proposed by SASB focuses on three categories of climate risks, namely the physical effects of climate change (physical), transition to a low-carbon, resilient economy (transition), and regulatory risks. It also highlights the climate risk categories most relevant and material to each of SASB’s 77 SICS industries to create a map of the industries impacted by the various climate risk categories. Using an AI-powered tool, this proposed project will thus make use of the newest NLP technology to review all publicly available disclosures for selected companies, and assess the degree to which past and current disclosures are consistent with the climate risk category mapping presented in SASB’s 2021 Technical Bulletin [3]. The main goal of this project is to bring additional clarity on the current state of climate risk reporting in order to improve and increase reporting of climate-related risk ﬁnancial information. Climate-related corporate disclosures are relied upon by numerous stakeholders, including investors and ﬁnancial institutions, to regularly assess associated risks, opportunities and impacts linked to their investment, lending and/or insurance\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
