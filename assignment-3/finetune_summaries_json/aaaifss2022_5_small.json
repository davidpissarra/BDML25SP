Forecasting models are limited by computational costs and therefore often can only make coarse resolution predictions. Statistical downscaling can provide an efficient method of upsampling low-resolution data. In this field, deep learning has been applied successfully, often us- ing image super-resolution methods from computer vision. Despite achieving visually compelling results in some cases, such models often violate conservation laws when predicting physical variables. In order to conserve important physical quantities, we develop methods that guarantee physical con- straints are satisfied by a deep downscaling model while also increasing their performance according to traditional metrics. We introduce two ways of constraining the network: A renor- malization layer added to the end of the neural network and a successive approach that scales with increasing upsampling factors. We show the applicability of our methods across different popular architectures and upsampling factors using ERA5 reanalysis data. Introduction Accurate modeling of weather and climate is critical for taking effective action to combat climate change. In ad- dition to shaping global understanding of climate change, local and regional predictions shape adaptation decisions and provide impetus for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Predicted and observed quantities such as pre- cipitation, wind speed, and temperature impact decisions in fields like agriculture, energy, and transportation. While these quantities are often required at a fine geographical and temporal scale to ensure informed decision making, most climate and weather models are extremely computationally expensive to run, resulting in coarse-resolution predictions, while observations are often sparsely available.

The terms downscaling in climate science and super- resolution (SR) in machine learning (ML) refer to learning a mapping between a low-resolution (LR) input sample and a high-resolution (HR) version of that sample. Downscal- ing via established statistical methods— statistical down- scaling —has been long used by the climate science com- munity to increase the resolution of climate data (Maraun and Widmann 2018). In parallel, computer vision SR has evolved rapidly using various deep learning architectures, with such methods now including super-resolution convo- lutional neural networks (CNNs) (Dong et al. 2016), gen- erative adversarial models (GANs) (Wang et al. 2018), vi- sion transformers (Yang et al. 2020), and normalizing flows (Lugmayr et al. 2020). Increasing the temporal resolution via frame interpolation is also an active area of research for video enhancement (Liu et al. 2017) that can be trans- ferred to spatio-temporal climate data. Recently, deep learn- ing approaches have been applied to a variety of climate and weather datasets, covering both model output data and ob- servations. Climate super-resolution has mostly focused on CNNs (Vandal et al. 2017), recently shifting towards GANs (Stengel et al. 2020). Generating high-resolution data with machine learning can produce realistic-looking images and good predictive accuracy. However, a major obstacle often encountered when applying ML to a physical system such as the Earth’s atmosphere is that the predicted output values can violate physical laws such as conservation of energy, momentum, and moisture. More broadly, there are numerous domains of ML for societal benefit in which satisfaction of physical constraints is fundamentally important. Examples include the discovery of new materials for energy and healthcare, aerodynamics simulations for efficient vehicles, and optimal control in industrial settings. In this work, we introduce a novel method to strictly enforce physical constraints between low-resolution (input) and high-resolution (output) images. Using ERA5 reanalysis data, we build datasets to learn the upsampling with differ-ent factors ranging from 2 up to 16 times enhancement. We introduce a renormalization layer that can either be added as the last layer to any network architecture or successively after each upsampling part, developing a new SR network architecture. Besides looking at spatial SR, we also include temporal SR or frame interpolation, demonstrating that our methodology works across all these architectures. Our novel constraining methodology is not only appli- cable to SR tasks in scientific areas, but it can also con- strain neural networks for emulation and prediction. Climate model emulation tasks like done by Beucler et al. (2021) and Harder et al. (2021) could benefit from using our con- straining layer. Within the SR domain, our work could have implications beyond scientific datasets as the constraining methodologies can advance state-of-the-art SR more gener- ally.
