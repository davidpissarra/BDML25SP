We propose a novel Bayesian approach which explicitly models known biases and uncertainties of current hail observations to produce more realistic estimates of severe hail risk from existing observations. Training this model on data from south-east Queensland, Australia, suggests that previous analyses of severe hail that did not account for this uncertainty may produce poorly calibrated risk estimates. Preliminary evaluation on withheld data con\frms that our model produces well-calibrated probabili- ties and is applicable out of sample. Whilst developed for hail, we highlight also the generality of our model and its potential applications to other severe weather phenomena and areas of climate change adaptation and mitigation. 1 Introduction On a continent regularly ravaged by bush\fres,  oods, and cyclones, storms producing hail greater than 2cm in diameter (hereafter severe hailstorms) over densely populated cities still stand among Australia's most costly insured weather events (McAneney et al., 2019; Insurance Council of Australia, 2022) and can seriously damage homes, businesses, and agriculture (e.g. Changnon (1992); Trapp et al. (2006)). To better prepare for these changing social and economic impacts as our climate warms, it is \frst necessary for us to know when and where severe hail risk is highest today (P\u0013 u\u0014 cik et al., 2019). However, hailstorms are only beginning to be resolved even in high-resolution climate models due to their small spatial and temporal scale and our incomplete knowledge of the relevant microphysics (Raupach et al., 2021; Mahoney et al., 2012; Brooks, 2013; Leslie et al., 2008). Hence, we must rely upon observations, which are themselves rare and biased, to understand severe hail risk (Brooks et al., 2003; Knight and Knight, 2001; Raupach et al., 2021; Schuster et al., 2005). In situ severe hail observations (hereafter hail reports) are typically made by storm chasers and the general public. Thus, many hail events are not reported and hail reports are concentrated around densely-populated areas introducing a signi\fcant, temporally-varying, spatial bias into the dataset (Brimelow and Taylor, 2017; Allen and Karoly, 2014; Allen et al., 2011; Tuovinen et al., 2015). Hence, many analyses of hail risk employ radar data, which provide consistent spatial and temporal coverage (Warren et al., 2020; Brook et al., 2021). However, radar data alone is insu\u000ecient to de\fnitively separate severe hail from hail less than 2cm in diameter and heavy rain (Knight and Knight, 2001; Brook et al., 2021). Whilst thresholds on various radar products exist which attempt to discriminate these two categories (e.g. Warren et al. (2020)), these thresholds a frequently selected from analysis of biased reports and do not account for uncertainty in the link between radar data and severe hail at the surface. We take a di\u000berent approach by developing a probabilistic Bayesian framework relating radar data to the probability of hail at the surface whilst accounting for chronic under- reporting of hail. Our approach facilitates the rigorous inclusion of prior knowledge and a 1Published as a workshop paper at \\Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2023 probabilistic characterisation of observational uncertainties.

To better prepare for these changing social and economic impacts as our climate warms, it is first necessary for us to know when and where severe hail risk is highest today (Púčik et al., 2019). However, hailstorms are only beginning to be resolved even in high-resolution climate models due to their small spatial and temporal scale and our incomplete knowledge of the relevant microphysics (Raupach et al., 2021; Mahoney et al., 2012; Brooks, 2013; Leslie et al., 2008).

However, radar data alone is insufficient to definitively separate severe hail from hail less than 2cm in diameter and heavy rain (Knight and Knight, 2001; Brook et al., 2021). While thresholds on various radar products exist that attempt to discriminate these two categories (e.g., Warren et al., 2020), these thresholds are frequently selected from analysis of biased reports and do not account for uncertainty in the link between radar data and severe hail at the surface.\n\nWe take a different approach by developing a probabilistic Bayesian framework relating radar data to the probability of hail at the surface while accounting for chronic under-reporting of hail.

From radar, we utilize the Maximum Expected Size of Hail (MESH) (Witt et al., 1998), a transformed, temperature-weighted, vertical integral of reflectivity, and take the maximum in each grid cell.

Specifically, the likelihood of hail in a given cell is P(R(t)i = 1 | m(t)i, d(t)i)."
