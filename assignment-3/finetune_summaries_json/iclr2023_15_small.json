Data-driven approaches to planning new infrastructure to promote cycling are rare, mainly be- cause data on cycling volume are only available selectively. By leveraging new and more granular data sources, we predict bicycle count measurements in Berlin, using data from free-floating bike-sharing systems in addition to weather, vaca- tion, infrastructure, and socioeconomic indicators. To reach a high prediction ac- curacy given the diverse data, we make use of machine learning techniques. Our goal is to ultimately predict traffic volume on all streets beyond those with coun- ters and to understand the variance in feature importance across time and space. Results indicate that bike-sharing data are valuable to improve the predictive per- formance, especially in cases with high outliers, and help generalize the models to new locations. 1 I NTRODUCTION Promoting bicycle mobility in cities has several benefits: Cycling contributes to individual (Oja et al., 2011) and public health (Woodcock et al., 2009). However, more importantly, already a shift of 5% of vehicle kilometers from cars to bicycles would reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 0.4% (Lindsay et al., 2011). More detailed information on current bicycle use is needed for promoting cycling through infrastructure changes, such as new bike lanes or adjusted traffic light phases, in an evidence-based, locally and timely targeted manner (Heesch & Langdon, 2016), especially given scarce resources, or when assessing accident cycling safety (Strauss et al., 2015). Given the spatiotemporal complexity of cycling data, machine learning (ML) algorithms have created many new research opportunities in this context (Klemmer et al., 2018; Rolnick et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2020). Long-term stationary bicycle counters provide data on sub-hourly, hourly, daily, or annual traffic volumes. As such counters are costly, they are only installed in limited numbers across a road net- work (Romanillos et al., 2016). While also often complemented with short-term (manual) counts (Ryus et al., 2014), the availability of bicycle traffic counts remains temporally and spatially limited. Accordingly, understanding how the observed counter measurements can be predicted to interpolate traffic volume beyond those eventually is key. In the literature, counter-measurements are so far analyzed through two main approaches. Firstly, studies detect unreliable data and interpolation missing entries (Beitel et al., 2018). Secondly, research focusing on the contributing factors behind 1the counter measurements, including simultaneous or lagged weather conditions and time factors, such as the day of the week and the season, (Miranda-Moreno & Nosal, 2011), public and school holidays Holmgren et al. (2017), and bike-sharing and app-based data in predicting counter mea- surements Miah et al. (2022). However, it has yet to be explored how the various features used for the prediction of the counters, but especially the number of bike-sharing rides, vary in their feature importance across time and between counters. As Yi et al. (2021) argues, this knowledge is of im- portance for traffic planners when they want to predict traffic volumes under financial constraints. It allows prioritization of which data should be acquired, given their cost. If a higher prediction accu- racy is required at specific times or places, this also gives an indication of which further indicators should be obtained for the given time or location. Therefore, we first implement and benchmark various ML algorithms for predicting the hourly counts of stationary counters within a city, using inputs that have been shown to be pertinent in previous studies. The models are evaluated using RMSE. Secondly perform further experiments to explore how the feature importance for various inputs varies over time and space. Based on these findings, it shall thirdly be evaluated whether bike-sharing data would permit interpolating the predictions to generate city-wide estimates of cycling volume on the hourly and street level. 2 D ATA AND METHODS 2.1 D ATA We use the city of Berlin as a case study. Bicycle counter data is available for 19 long and 12 short- term counter locations at the hourly level (SenUMVK). The dockless bike sharing data comprises nine months from 2019 for the providers Nextbike and Call-a-bike (CityLab Berlin). Additionally, we scrap the equivalent data for seven months in 2022 from Nextbike (Nextbike, 2020). The data contains the departure and arrival points and times of bike trips. We interpolate the trajectories us- ing the bicycle routing algorithm from OpenStreetMaps (OpenStreetMap contributors, 2017). From the data, we exclude trips shorter than 100m and longer than 50km as well as trips shorter than 90 seconds and longer than 10 hours. In addition to cycling data, we use the hour\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Moreover, a shift of 5% of vehicle kilometers from cars to bicycles would reduce transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 0.4% (Lindsay et al., 2011). To promote cycling through infrastructure changes, such as new bike lanes or adjusted traffic light phases, detailed information on current bicycle use is needed in an evidence-based, locally and timely targeted manner (Heesch & Langdon, 2016). This is especially important given scarce resources or when assessing accident cycling safety (Strauss et al., 2015).\n\nMachine learning algorithms have created new research opportunities in this context (Klemmer et al., 2018; Rolnick et al., 2023; Xie et al., 2020). Long-term stationary bicycle counters provide data on sub-hourly, hourly, daily, or annual traffic volumes. However, these counters are costly and are only installed in limited numbers across a road network (Romanillos et al., 2016). To understand how counter measurements can be predicted to interpolate traffic volume beyond those with counters, it is essential to analyze the contributing factors behind counter measurements.\n\nPrevious studies have focused on detecting unreliable data and interpolating missing entries (Beitel et al., 2018) or identifying the contributing factors behind counter measurements, including weather conditions, time factors, and socioeconomic indicators (Miranda-Moreno & Nosal, 2011; Holmgren et al., 2017; Miah et al., 2022). However, it remains unclear how the various features used for prediction vary in their importance across time and between counters. This knowledge is crucial for traffic planners when predicting traffic volumes under financial constraints (Yi et al., 2021).\n\nTo address this gap, we implement and benchmark various machine learning algorithms for predicting hourly counts of stationary counters within a city, using inputs that have been shown to be pertinent in previous studies. We evaluate the models using the root mean squared error (RMSE). We then explore how the feature importance for various inputs varies over time and space. Finally, we evaluate whether bike-sharing data can be used to interpolate the predictions and generate city-wide estimates of cycling volume on the hourly and street level.\n\nWe use the city of Berlin as a case study.
