Those are observed around the world and have strong impacts on marine ecosystems. The evaluated deep learning methods will be integrated for the task of marine heatwave prediction in order to overcome the limitations of spatiotemporal data and improve data-driven seasonal marine heatwave forecasts. 1. Motivation: Challenges in Spatiotemporal Data Geophysical data have unique spatiotemporal properties, which require speciﬁc considerations when used to build a machine learning-based prediction system. While machine learning approaches are commonly used to perform forecast- ing tasks, spatiotemporal forecasting has its own speciﬁci- ties that have to be accounted for when selecting a suitable approach. The selection process requires understanding the features of spatiotemporal data, which are high-dimensional, often are limited in extent, and temporally correlated. Below we will review the characteristics of spatiotemporal data in detail. High dimensionality: Environmental data are indexed by up to three dimensions in space and one in time. Addition- ally, a single climate event is usually caused by multiple 1School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Can- terbury, Christchurch, New Zealand2Environmental Research Institute, University of Waikato, Hamilton, New Zealand 3MetOcean Solutions, Meteorological Service of New Zealand, Raglan, New Zealand.

Either observations or reanalysis datasets com- monly contain tens to hundreds of variables that describe a single system. Domain knowledge can help select and hence reduce the number of variables to use as predictors in a machine learning algorithm. For example, in a re- cent study of marine heatwaves in the northwest Atlantic, the heatwave in 2012 was primarily driven by atmospheric forcing and the heatwave in 2017 was driven by offshore oceanic forcing (Gawarkiewicz et al., 2019), indicating that the roles of different types of forcing vary from event to event. However, without domain knowledge, determining the right combination of inputs from many variables is not so straightforward. With the increasing demand for more interpretable machine learning models, the trend has been to introduce more variables as predictors into a model, which leads to high dimensionality in the input. For example, in El Ni˜no–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forecasts, besides sea surface temperature and heat content anomalies (Ham et al., 2019), is it possible to include more inputs into the model, such as zonal wind anomalies (Lai et al., 2018) and sea level pressure anomalies (Manatsa et al., 2008)? Hence, select- ing an appropriate number of variables from spatiotemporal data remains an open research question. Limited data: The training of a robust deep learning model requires as much heterogeneous data as possible in order for the model to learn the entire possible range of behavior of the system. However, spatiotemporal data are often limited in extent. Temporally, data collection has evolved a lot with the advances of physical equipment and technology, and the quality and extent of collected environmental data have increased greatly in the mid-to-late 20thcentury. Meanwhile, unlike the big data that is related to human activities which are growing quickly, such as health records, surveillance videos, and social media activities, new geophysical data are generated relatively slowly. Spatially, collection is limited to the physical environment on Earth and the resolution might be rather low. For exam- ple, in the NCEP Global Ocean Data Assimilation System (GODAS) dataset (from 1980 to 2020), the spatial resolution of the dataset is 1 by 0.333 degrees (360 longitudes between 0.5 and 359.5 and 418 latitudes between -74.5 and 64.499) (Behringer & Xue, 2004). This degree of spatial resolutionDeep Learning for Spatiotemporal Anomaly Forecasting: A Case Study of Marine Heatwaves may not be enough to capture localized climatological phe- nomena, and the temporal resolution may not be sufﬁcient for training a robust deep learning model. The temporal and spatial limitations of collecting data are unlikely to be mitigated by simply modifying the intervals. Transfer learning, including one-shot learning (Li et al., 2006) and zero-shot learning (Palatucci et al., 2009), from a similar learning task has proven its feasibility in the spa- tiotemporal space (Zhang et al., 2021; Buckchash & Raman, 2021). However, how to ﬁnd a similar large dataset and/or an appropriate pre-trained model for transfer learning re- mains a problem.

While machine learning approaches are commonly used for forecasting tasks, spatiotemporal forecasting has its own specificities that need to be accounted for when selecting a suitable approach. The selection process requires understanding the features of spatiotemporal data, which are high-dimensional, often limited in extent, and temporally correlated.\n\nHigh dimensionality: Environmental data are indexed by up to three dimensions in space and one in time. A single climate event is usually caused by multiple factors. Observations or reanalysis datasets commonly contain tens to hundreds of variables that describe a single system. Domain knowledge can help select and reduce the number of variables to use as predictors in a machine learning algorithm. For example, in a recent study of marine heatwaves in the northwest Atlantic, the heatwave in 2012 was primarily driven by atmospheric forcing, and the heatwave in 2017 was driven by offshore oceanic forcing, indicating that the roles of different types of forcing vary from event to event. Without domain knowledge, determining the right combination of inputs from many variables is not straightforward. With the increasing demand for more interpretable machine learning models, the trend has been to introduce more variables as predictors into a model, leading to high dimensionality in the input.\n\nLimited data: The training of a robust deep learning model requires a large amount of heterogeneous data to learn the entire possible range of behavior of the system.
