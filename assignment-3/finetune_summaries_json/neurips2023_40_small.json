However, scaling up plant-level monitoring is cost prohibitive, and flowering transitions are complex and difficult to model. We develop two sets of approaches to detect the onset of flowering at large-scale and high-resolution. Using fine grain temperature data with domain knowledge based features and traditional machine learning models provides the best performance. Using satellite data, with deep learning to deal with high dimensionality and trans- fer learning to overcome ground truth label sparsity, is a challenging but promising approach, as it reaches good performance with more systematically available data. 1 Introduction In temperate regions, temporal shifts in the timing of plant flowering are a key signal of an ecosystem’s response to environmental change. In particular, climate change is inducing long-term shifts in average weather, which tends to advance the onset of plant flowering [ 1]. This impacts a broad range of ecological processes: flower exposure to late frosts or heat waves, which is a major driver of plant reproductive success including crop yield [ 26]; the synchronization between plants and their pollinators, which respond to different environmental cues [ 27]; and the onset of pollen season, which impacts pollen allergy prevalence [ 24]. However, plant flowering is also one of the developmental stages that is most difficult to monitor, compared to more uniform stages like leaf opening, which is well-tracked by remote sensing [ 30]. In particular, ground observations on the timing of plant flowering are sparse, and difficult to exploit due to variation in flowering onset definition and monitoring frequency. In this paper, we seek to construct a large-scale proxy measure of the onset of flowering that is: (1) available at a relatively fine spatial resolution to capture local variations, (2) able to capture interannual variations in the timing of flowering, and (3) able to extrapolate across time and space, to map flowering across many years and large geographical areas. In particular, we compare the performance of deep learning models that use rich and widely available satellite imagery, with lower dimensional models that use domain knowledge informed features, based on high-frequency weather data or annual vegetation indices. Implications Measuring interannual shifts in the onset of plant flowering at high resolution is critical to fully capture climate change impacts on plant yield.

High resolution flowering data can also help resolve mixed evidence on climate change impacts on plant-pollinator synchronization [ 27], by increasing the amount of co-occurring data on plant flowering and pollinator flight. It can also inform important management decisions: timing pesticide application to avoid damages to beneficial insects during flowering, timing herbicide application to minimize seed production of invasive plant species, timing beehive placement to optimize pollen availability for bees, or planning for local tourism or spring allergy season. In this paper, we focus here on ex-post detection of flowering onset rather than on forecasting. The target application is having locally accurate data on flowering onset across large spatial and temporal scales, to evaluate more precisely the ex-post impact of climate change and management decisions on ecological outcomes, which will help guide future decisions. Related work Current efforts to monitor the onset of spring flowering at regional to continental scales rest on numerous but sparse ground observations [ 19,22,29]; on weather-based proxies like the First Bloom Index [ 25] (included in our model comparison), or weather-based species-specific models of flowering trained on herbarium data [ 20] (mean absolute error (MAE) ranges from 7 to 79 days across models, and the median MAE is 19 days); and on remotely sensed vegetation metrics, often not validated using ground truth observations [ 7]. To overcome the difficulty of comparing approaches evaluated on different test datasets, which can vary widely in their underlying variability, we provide a comparison of a comprehensive set of models. 2 The Flowering Onset Prediction Task At a high level we seek to predict the date of the onset of flowering at the species and land- scape level, that is the first day of the year when a certain density of flower clusters are observed across plants of that species in this landscape. In practice, we target a spatial resolution of 500 m to match the resolution of publicly available input data. We instantiate this task for the Com- mon Lilac, an early spring-flowering shrub, using 398 citizen science labels from a long-term monitoring program recording lilac phenology [ 22]. We focus on a region in the Northeast US, shown on Fig. 1, and on the period 2006-2022, to maximize monitoring density (App. A.1).
