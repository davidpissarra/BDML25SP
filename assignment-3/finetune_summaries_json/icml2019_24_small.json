We use a deep learning-based computer vision approach to measure ﬂood-related humanitarian risk in 5 cities in Africa. 1. Introduction By 2050, more than two-thirds of the worlds population will live in cities, with the majority of this growth occurring in developing countries (United Nations & Social Affairs, 2018). Rapid urbanization in developing countries is often unplanned and carries substantial risk for critical infrastruc- ture, public health and clean water provision. More frequent and severe ﬂooding caused by climate change is further in- ﬂaming this. National, state, and local government ofﬁcials need access to a new suite of tools to better plan their cities. Proper measurement and monitoring enables e.g. better resource allocation for critical infrastructure, commercial zoning interventions which increase tax revenue, and make viable insurance markets that incentivize growth in lower risk areas. High cadence geospatial imagery coupled with advances in Deep learning, offer transformative potential to provide such tools. Inspired by studies in Africa (Butterﬁeld, 2017) and (Lall, 2017), we monitor building development in 5 African cities, and use ﬂood risk data to quantify the humanitarian risk from ﬂooding. 2. Methodology Our work ﬂow is shown in Figure 1. Monitoring urban growth in regions of high ﬂood risk starts with daily optical imagery produced by Planet. Planet operates the largest constellation of Earth observation satellites, imaging the Earths landmass daily at 3-5 meter resolution. To avoidcloudy images, we consume Planets monthly nearly cloud- free ’basemap’ images compiled from multiple days. We use a variant of U-Net (O. Ronneberger, 2015) - a deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation of images, used widely by the remote sensing community - to map building footprints in the Planet RGB imagery. The training dataset is compiled from a globally diverse set of geogra- phies, seasons, and terrains, which has lead to our model generalizing well. (FMGlobal, 2019) provides a global map of high-hazard ﬂood zones derived from a combination of historic ﬂood data, hydrology, hydraulic science, and up to date environ- mental monitoring data from rainfall, snow melt and terrain. Intersecting the building segmentation masks with the high ﬂood risk zones enables quantitative urban ﬂood risk analy- sis. 3. Results 3.1. Change in Building Coverage in 5 Cities We computed the change in urban area from mid-2017 to early 2019 (the time of writing) for 5 cities: Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Bamako in Mali, Bangui in Central African Republic, Casablanca in Morocco, and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. We selected cities in Africa with varied cli- mates and terrains, which intersected high-risk ﬂood zones, and had low cloud coverage. Table 1 shows the percentage of the urban area - the area classiﬁed as building by our model - for each of the 5 cities within high ﬂood risk zones, as of March 2019. Errors in these values are derived solely from the Poisson pixel count - in future analyses we will include additional error terms stemming from geographical variability. We also show the absolute growth since July 2017, calculated as the difference of the ﬁrst 6 versus the last 6 monthly area values in the period. In all 5 of the cities we observe urban growth in high ﬂood risk zones.Planetary Scale Monitoring of Urban Growth in High Flood Risk Areas Figure 1.

We use a deep learning-based computer vision approach to measure flood-related humanitarian risk in 5 cities in Africa. \n\n1. Introduction\n\nBy 2050, more than two-thirds of the world's population will live in cities, with the majority of this growth occurring in developing countries (United Nations & Social Affairs, 2018). Rapid urbanization in developing countries is often unplanned and carries substantial risk for critical infrastructure, public health, and clean water provision. More frequent and severe flooding caused by climate change exacerbates this issue. National, state, and local government officials need access to a new suite of tools to better plan their cities. Proper measurement and monitoring enable better resource allocation for critical infrastructure, commercial zoning interventions that increase tax revenue, and viable insurance markets that incentivize growth in lower-risk areas. High-cadence geospatial imagery coupled with advances in deep learning offers transformative potential to provide such tools. Inspired by studies in Africa (Butterfield, 2017) and (Lall, 2017), we monitor building development in 5 African cities and use flood risk data to quantify the humanitarian risk from flooding.\n\n2. Methodology\n\nOur workflow is shown in Figure 1. Monitoring urban growth in regions of high flood risk starts with daily optical imagery produced by Planet. Planet operates the largest constellation of Earth observation satellites, imaging the Earth's landmass daily at 3-5 meter resolution. To avoid cloudy images, we consume Planet's monthly nearly cloud-free 'basemap' images compiled from multiple days. We use a variant of U-Net (Ronneberger, 2015) - a deep learning architecture for semantic segmentation of images, widely used by the remote sensing community - to map building footprints in the Planet RGB imagery. The training dataset is compiled from a globally diverse set of geographies, seasons, and terrains, which has led to our model generalizing well. FMGlobal (2019) provides a global map of high-hazard flood zones derived from a combination of historic flood data, hydrology, hydraulic science, and up-to-date environmental monitoring data from rainfall, snowmelt, and terrain. Intersecting the building segmentation masks with the high flood risk zones enables quantitative urban flood risk analysis.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Change in Building Coverage in 5 Cities\n\nWe computed the change in urban area from mid-2017 to early 2019 for 5 cities: Addis Ababa in Ethiopia, Bamako in Mali, Bangui in the Central African Republic, Casablanca in Morocco, and Ouagadougou in Burkina Faso. We selected cities in Africa with varied climates and terrains, which intersected high-risk flood zones, and had low cloud coverage. Table 1 shows the percentage of the urban area classified as building by our model for each of the 5 cities within high flood risk zones, as of March 2019. Errors in these values are derived solely from the Poisson pixel count - in future analyses, we will include additional error terms stemming from geographical variability. We also show the absolute growth since July 2017, calculated as the difference of the first 6 versus the last 6 monthly area values in the period.
