These ﬂoats, however, are limited in the number of variables measured. In this study, we train neural networks to predict silicate and phosphate values in the Southern Ocean from temperature, pressure, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, and location and apply these models to earth system model (ESM) and BGC-Argo data to expand the utility of this ocean observation network. We trained our neural networks on observations from the Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) and use dropout regularization to provide uncertainty bounds around our predicted values. Our neural network signiﬁcantly improves upon linear regression but shows variable levels of uncertainty across the ranges of predicted variables. We explore the generalization of our estimators to test data outside our training distribution from both ESM and BGC-Argo data. Our use of out-of-distribution test data to examine shifts in biogeochemical parameters and calculate uncertainty bounds around estimates advance the state-of-the-art in oceanographic data and climate monitoring. We make our data and code publicly available. 1 Introduction Ship-based ocean measurements, like those collected by the Global Ocean Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP), provide valuable insight into ocean carbon uptake, biological processes, circulation, and climate variability. However, research cruises are expensive, sparse and often seasonally biased due to weather conditions. The Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) program aims to become the ﬁrst globally comprehensive sensing array for ocean ecosystems and biogeochemistry. Yet, proﬁling ﬂoats are limited in the number of sensors they can support [ 5]. Developing models which accurately predict additional features, such as nutrient ratios, from limited sensor data will broaden the applicability of BGC-Argo ﬂoats and allow us to better monitor and understand changes to the Earth’s climate.

[ 2] demonstrate advantages of using Bayesian neural networks, which account for uncertainty around predicted values, to estimate nutrient concentrations, and D’Alelio et al. [ 7] show an application of regression methods for examining interannual variability in primary productivity. We draw on these methods to develop neural networks trained on cruise data to predict phosphate and silicate, important nutrients controlling ocean productivity and biodiversity [ 14]. This is important because these nutrients regulate biological processes that remove carbon from the surface ocean at an annual rate roughly equivalent to annual anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions [ 12],[10]. The Southern Ocean is selected for developing and testing these models as it is an important global carbon sink and has the most extensive BGC-Argo ﬂoat coverage at this time [8]. 2 Methods Dataset and training. We use GO-SHIP data [ 3] in our training set to train our models. The data set includes 42,412 data points from Southern Ocean cruises between 2001-2019 as shown in Figure 1. We use GO-SHIP data for latitude, longitude, pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen and nitrate to predict phosphate and silicate. We restrict our data to latitudes below 45 ºS, remove rows with missing data and furthermore follow the standards of the World Ocean Circulation Experiment Hydrographic Program and use quality control (QC) ﬂags to down-select our data. We standardize the pressure, temperature, salinity, oxygen, and nitrate features. The position latitude and longitude data is projected to the WGS 84 / Antarctic Polar Stereographic coordinate reference system. We do not include time dependency (month) because initial evaluation of our linear regression indicates low importance of seasonal variability in predicting silicate and phosphate variation.
