    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nHowever, due to the natural complexity of the problem, the exact avenues and relative strengths by which this will happen are still unknown. The development of accurate forecasting models is thus of great importance to enable policymakers to design effective interventions. To date, most machine learning methods aimed at tackling this problem lack consideration of causal structure, thereby making them unreliable for the types of counterfactual analysis necessary when making policy decisions. Econometrics has developed robust techniques for estimating cause-effect relations in time-series, specifically through the use of cointegration analysis and Granger causality. However, these methods are frequently limited in flexibility, especially in the estimation of nonlinear relationships.\n\nIn this work, we propose to integrate nonlinear function approximators with the robust causal estimation methods to ultimately develop an accurate agricultural forecasting model capable of robust counterfactual analysis. This method would be a valuable new asset for government and industrial stakeholders to understand how climate change impacts agricultural production.\n\nThe climate system is becoming more extreme, with an increase in heavy precipitation events and long dry spells. Such drastic changes in weather events will inevitably have a significant impact on crop yield. The precise effect of different climate variables on yield is complicated due to known variation among plant types and intricate unknown causal structures. For instance, a naive correlational analysis of the data shows increasing temperature to increase vegetable production, as both have steadily increased in the last 50 years. However, this first impression can be misleading.\n\nA potential problematic causal graph illustrates the issue, depicting an unobserved causal effect. If we consider temperature (T), yield (Y), and a third variable (C) (potentially population or pollution), it can be the case that C acts causally on both temperature and yield, thereby confounding initial estimates of how temperature may impact yield. A mistaken causal estimation would have significant negative impact for policy decisions. Confounders in the climate science literature have led to misleading correlations. Thus, accurately assessing the causal effects of climate change on agricultural production is critical for correctly forming climate change adaptation and mitigation policies.\n\nIn prior work, researchers in econometrics and machine learning have examined the effects of climate change on agriculture, but these approaches have yet to capture the causal influence of environmental and socioeconomic variables on agriculture. In this work, we propose to couple the econometric techniques of cointegration analysis and Granger causality with machine learning, thereby combining the robust econometric methods of causal discovery with the nonlinear modeling capacity of machine learning.\n\nWe propose to apply this method to assess the effects of climate change on agricultural production, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done before in the literature. The contributions of this proposal are: (i) the application of powerful nonlinear causal analysis to a new agriculture dataset, and (ii) the improved robustness of these causal methods through the use of cointegration analysis.\n\nIn econometrics, importance is given to the techniques of cointegration and the estimation of Vector Error Correction Models (VECM) or Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models. However, such models come with several known limitations. For example, cointegration tests are not flexible enough to handle nonlinear relations, and in general, make use of basic statistical models, thereby lacking consideration of causality by default. Despite this, cointegration methods are useful for robustly unveiling hidden relations between seemingly unrelated variables. Moreover, such statistical models are reliable only if the initial conditions and assumptions of the models do not change. As we are working with factors in the climate system that have been changing over the last decades, the initial conditions have been changing throughout time.\n\nOn the other hand, machine learning models are usually not able to detect causality between variables. Traditionally, machine learning models focus on prediction, but not on causality detection.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe propose an approach where the econometric tests of cointegration and Granger causation are combined with machine learning methods to develop an accurate agricultural forecasting model capable of robust counterfactual analysis."
