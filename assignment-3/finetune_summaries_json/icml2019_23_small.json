Introduction Acquatic ecosystems such as coral reefs, kelp beds, seagrass and wetlands serve key roles to sustain the coastal marine populations. They serve as major sites of nutrient cycling, transport, and carbon storage. They occupy only 0.1% area of the ocean, but they are massive reservoirs of biodiversity (Roberts et al., 2002; Bruckner, 2002) and provide shelter to and support over 25% of all marine species on the planet (WWF). However the balance within these coastal ecosys- tems is fragile, and is being increasingly threatened due to 1The Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University, Pitts- burgh, PA, USA2Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA3University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, USA.

While these stressors are evident while analyzing ef- fects on a local scale, the data is insufﬁcient to characterize global scale effects. A large contributor to these stressors is Methane, which is a powerful greenhouse gas that is strongly linked with other trace gases as the cause of global warming, and is the focus of numerous air quality and public health policies (Duren et al., 2017). Many current methane monitoring methods are limited to regional or coarser scale resolution and often cannot detect individual sources. This is a gap that remote sensing1based techniques have success- fully been able to bridge (Hochberg et al., 2003). The ﬁeld of imaging spectroscopy itself has a long history that can be traced back to early instruments built at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in the early 1980s (Gao et al., 2009). These instruments were built to measure the solar radiance after reﬂection from the earth’s surface. These measurements can then be analyzed to recover valuable atmospheric and surface properties. Recently, there has been a growing interest to use these instruments to assess the environmental effects of climate change including: \u000fOceanic effects: Monitor ocean circulation, measure the ocean temperature and wave heights, and track sea ice (NOAA, 2009). \u000fLand effects: Track changes in land vegetation, defor- estation, and examine the health of indigenous plants and crops (Guo et al., 2013). \u000fAtmospheric pollution: Quantify worldwide emissions, concentrations of air pollutants, and their trends.

Though these are examples scenarios in which imaging spectrometers have successfully been used till date, the near future presents an unprecedented opportunity for rapid progress in applications of remote sensing to beneﬁt society, due to recent computing advances.

Of crucial concern among these is the accurate removal of atmospheric effects from the radiation incident on the sensor.
