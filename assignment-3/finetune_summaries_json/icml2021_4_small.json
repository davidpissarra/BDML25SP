However, with only a small portion of companies volunteering to dis- close their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is nearly impossible for investors to align their investment strategies with the measures. By train- ing a machine learning model on disclosed GHG emissions, we are able to estimate the emissions of other companies globally who do not disclose their emissions. In this paper, we show that our model provides accurate estimates of corporate GHG emissions to investors such that they are able to align their investments with the regulatory measures and achieve net-zero goals. 1. Introduction There is clear, scientiﬁc evidence to show the devastating impact that increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is having across the world (NASA; Strona & Bradshaw, 2018). Governments and private society now recognize the urgency with which they need to act to mitigate the risks that climate change poses. Private companies have joined international governments in their pledge to hit net zero by 2050 (Indus- try). In order to make a meaningful change, we need to measure who is contributing GHG into the atmosphere and monitor their claims to decarbonize.

For these and other international measures to be successful, it is crucial that global investors are aware of the GHG emis- sions of companies operating around the world. However, since GHG emissions are currently disclosed on a voluntary basis (Fisher-Vanden & Thorburn, 2011), merely 2.27% of companies ﬁling ﬁnancial statements are disclosing their GHG emissions according to our Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) datasets. Moreover, the European Parliament requires investors to apply “the precautionary principle” that penalizes non-disclosing companies by ap- propriately overestimating their emissions (EU, a). There are four major challenges to estimate GHG emissions: \u000fSigniﬁcantly imbalanced labeled and unlabeled datasets. Here, labeled dataset means the GHG emis- sions disclosed by companies. Speciﬁcally, our labeled dataset contains only 24,052 annual GHG emissions disclosed by 3,960 companies from ﬁscal years 2000 to 2020, while our unlabeled dataset (target prediction universe) contains 619,703 records of 61,467 compa- nies in the same ﬁscal range as the labeled dataset. \u000fHigh feature missing rates. Although our dataset in- cludes more than 1,000 features on public and pri- vate companies, 525 of the features have missing rates greater than 90%. \u000fMismatched feature missing patterns between the la- beled and unlabeled datasets. It is observed that com- panies who disclose their GHG emissions tend to dis- close other ESG features as well. For example, energy consumption is disclosed by 97% companies in the labeled dataset while by only 20% companies in the unlabeled dataset. \u000fUncertainty of estimation. According to the precau- tionary principle, the uncertainty around an estimate must be quantiﬁed, which means models outputting a single point estimate of the GHG emission do not sufﬁce. The problem of estimating corporate GHG emissions has been studied in a few prior works, and their methodologies can be classiﬁed into two categories: conventional statisti- cal approaches and modern machine learning approaches.Estimation of Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emissions via Machine Learning Conventional statistical approaches either assign the mean or median of disclosed GHG emissions of an industry sector to the non-disclosing companies (Nguyen et al., 2021), or build a simple linear regression model for each industry sector using only a few universally available features such as annual revenue of a company (Goldhammer et al., 2017; CDP, 2020; Nguyen et al., 2021). Such models highly rely on various assumptions that may not hold in reality such as the features are always available, all companies in the same industry sector have the same emission level, and linear re- lationship between the features and the GHG emissions. As an example, the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) applies a Gamma Generalized Linear Model (GLM) trained with 2,000 observations to estimate the GHG emissions of 5,000 non-disclosing companies (CDP, 2020), in which only rev- enues of a company from various CDP de\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
