Predicting ship speed through water is a key element 3 in calculating GHG emissions. However, few models address this prediction in a 4 way that integrates both physical principles and machine learning. Our approach 5 combines physical modeling with data-driven techniques to predict real ship speed 6 through water in two key steps: \"Solve\" and \"Predict\". In the first step “Solve”, a 7 differential equation is resolved to estimate speed through calm water. \"Predict\" 8 step uses a machine learning model that incorporates maritime and meteorological 9 conditions and historical data to improve speed predictions in real-world conditions. 10 This hybrid approach leverages both physics-based knowledge and machine learn- 11 ing models to provide a more comprehensive solution for accurately predicting 12 ship speed through water. 13 1 Introduction 14 With the growing focus on greenhouse gas emissions [ 3,4] the maritime transport segment needs 15 to reduce its total annual greenhouse gas emissions by 50% compared to 2008. In this context, 16 through-water speed predictions are becoming increasingly relevant for validating ship performance 17 under real operational conditions, as well as for optimizing and predicting ship emissions. Ship speed 18 determines fuel consumption, a major source of greenhouse gases. Therefore, to predict the amount 19 of emissions caused by a ship, prediction of ship speed is an essential factor [8]. 20 In our work we are going to predict the reel through water speed Vwrof ships using a hybrid model 21 which is composed of a first physical part where we solve a differential equation in order to have a 22 physical parameter useful for the second part of the model where we predict Vwrusing a data driven 23 model. The physical part of our model is constructed mainly of a Physics Informed Neural Network 24 (PINN) which allows us to solve a differential equation and to generate the speed through calm water 25 Vwwhich will be useful for the prediction of real speed through water. 26 Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.[7] have demonstrated the effectiveness of PINNs for solving differential equations using collocation 27 points as inputs to the network and a loss function that integrates both the differential equation 28 formula and initial conditions. 29 In the literature, various approaches have been utilized to address issues related to speed prediction: 30 Physical models, which rely on established physical formulas, represent the first category. These 31 models, although grounded in scientific principles, have been widely criticized for their inability to 32 account for the specific characteristics of individual ships [5]. 33 Statistical models offer another approach, focusing on the analysis of historical data to predict 34 ship speed. For instance [ 6] compared three statistical models to predict ship speed based on the 35 revolutions per minute of the main engine and prevailing weather conditions. 36 The advent of large-scale data collection from ships and tracking systems has paved the way for 37 data-driven models. These models utilize machine learning techniques to predict ship speed more 38 accurately. [ 9] applied a sequential random forest for short-term speed prediction, leveraging the vast 39 amounts of data available. Similarly, [ 10] developed a machine learning-based regression model that 40 uses ship navigation data and weather forecasts to predict speed under different weather conditions.[ 2] 41 explored deep learning sequence models, including LSTM, BiLSTM, and transformers, finding that 42 the transformer model delivered the best performance, albeit with a high parameter count. 43 In recent years, some hybrid models have been used. These models aim to leverage the interpretability 44 of physical models while enhancing prediction accuracy with machine learning. [ 1] developed 45 a hybrid model that integrates a physical model with an LSTM to predict state variables. In 46 this approach, the LSTM predicts the residuals of the physical model, which itself combines first 47 principles derived from Newton’s second law with a regression component for data-driven learning. 48 Additionally, [ 10] proposed a hybrid framework based on Gaussian Processes to capture the complex 49 relationships between engine power and ship speed. This method integrates machine learning with 50 domain knowledge grounded in physical principles, resulting in a robust model that minimizes the risk 51 of overfitting. Similarly, Lang et al. [ 5] employed a hybrid model that combines a physics-informed 52 neural network, utilizing a differential equation, with an XGBoost model to predict the speed over 53 ground based on weather conditions. 54 2 Our Proposal 55 We adapt the approach proposed by Lang et al.[ 5] to predict the real speed through water, and we 56 generalize it so that it is not limited to a model specific to a single vessel. In this way, we make the 57 method applicable to any ship that has historical data.
