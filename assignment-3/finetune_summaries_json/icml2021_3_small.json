Experimental results show our best model achieves an average accuracy of 60% over 6 tree species. 1. Introduction Trees are well recognised for their importance to the planet and human life. Environmentally, trees slow surface runoff from rainfall, reducing ﬂood risk, water pollution and soil erosion (Chandler et al., 2017). They improve overall air quality by absorbing particulate matter, create a cooling effect, and mitigating the heat island effect in urban ar- eas (Manickathan et al., 2017). A study by (Bastin et al., 2019) shows forestation is a possible strategy for mitigat- ing climate change. Trees capture and store atmospheric carbon-dioxide and lock it up for centuries. Trees play a key role in climate change mitigation by capturing, storing and consequently reducing atmospheric CO2 levels, the main adverse contributor to greenhouse gases and climate change.

To leverage this potential, effective forest and urban tree management is essential. This requires detailed information about tree species, composition, health and geo- graphical location of each tree in order to create a long term sustainable plan for plantation and forestation sites, pruning schedules and mitigation of potential problems (Baeten & Bruelheide, 2018). It also helps to monitor tree species di- versity and track health and growth rate to creates a more robust ecosystem with better productivity and greater re- silience to disease and pests (Gamfeldt & Snall, 2013; Rust, 2016). Such management system demands for an accessible, reliable yet economically and practically viable platform to automatically detect, classify and monitor forests and urban trees. Historically, this has been carried out by experts and volunteers visiting trees on the ground but this is a laborious, time-consuming and expensive approach. Alternatively Li- DAR technology, used to estimate the number of trees in an area (Wilkes et al., 2018) and categorise their species (Kim et al., 2008), paved the way to automated urban tree and forest management. However, LiDAR surveying is a costly process mainly due to the speciality equipment and skilled human resource required to collect and interpret it (Rezatec, 2020). Hyperspectral imaging and remote sensing satel- lites images have advanced signiﬁcantly over the last couple of decades and are now able to produce high-resolution images which facilitates tree detection and species classiﬁ- cation (Fricker et al., 2019; Dalponte et al., 2014; Maschler et al., 2018; Clark et al., 2005). There are a limited num- ber of studies looking into the detection classiﬁcation of trees using RGB aerial images. RGB aerial image survey- ing can be as costly as other aforementioned approaches however availability of mapping service such as Google Maps and Bing Maps can signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of surveying and data collection. Studies like (Wegner et al., 2020; Nezami et al., 2020) utilized images from these plat- forms paired with Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to create a fully automated yet accurate tree detection and classiﬁcation model which is pertinent to effective forest and urban tree management.
