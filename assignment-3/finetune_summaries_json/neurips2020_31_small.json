Its impact on the global stock market is predicted to be extensive, with damages estimated in the trillions of dollars [ 1]. However, it is difﬁcult to predict exactly how and where climate change will impact ﬁnancial assets, largely due to the lack of quantitative data on the subject. Nonetheless, gathering data regarding the risks and exposure that climate change poses to speciﬁc companies, as well as organizations’ efforts to address and mitigate this risk, is a key part of the effort of predicting the extent of climate change impacts on the stock market. This data is often in textual format, buried in hundreds of pages of ﬁnancial documents which must be manually analyzed, requiring signiﬁcant time and effort. In fact, disclosing climate change risks and liabilities currently consists of a mix of mandatory and voluntary initiatives, resulting in disclosures that are often very heterogeneous and lack structure with regards to the subjects they cover, the metrics they use and the extent to which climate risk is quantiﬁed. The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) was founded in 2015, with the goal of improving the state of climate disclosing and encouraging companies to increase their climate transparency. In 2017, the TCFD released a set of recommendations to help structure and formalize companies’ sustainability and climate risk reporting [ 3]. One of the key proposals that they made was a set of 14 questions to guide sustainability reporting, covering many different topics, from quantifying greenhouse gas emissions to ensuring the proper identiﬁcation of climate-related risks and/or opportunities by the board of directors. In recent years, the TCFD questions are increasingly Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.used to guide the analysis of climate risk disclosures, with analysts using them to assess the extent and type of climate exposure of companies and the risk this poses to their business. The TCFD itself also uses the 14 questions to publish their yearly status reports on the progress of sustainability reporting. In 2019, they estimated that out of the 1000 companies whose reports they analyzed, only 29% made relevant climate disclosures, stating that they were “concerned that not enough companies are disclosing decision-useful climate-related ﬁnancial information\" [4]. However, this ﬁgure is hard to calculate since it is based on a subset of the total number of companies and since the current approach used to analyse the reports is based on keyword search for analyst-deﬁned terms. This suggests that much of the available data regarding ﬁnancial climate disclosures is under-utilized or simply ignored. In recent years, a few proposals have also been made regarding using NLP for analyzing sustainability reporting, signifying that this ﬁeld is gathering momentum [ 5,6]. The goal of our research project is to use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a tool allowing more efﬁcient analysis of ﬁnancial reports, reducing the time and effort required to identify climate-relevant disclosures. 2 Model and Approach Transformer models [ 7] have had substantial success in many NLP tasks, from question answering [ 8] to machine translation [ 9] and natural language inference [ 10]. In recent years, different variations of architectures such as BERT [ 11] have also been used for domain-speciﬁc applications, from biomedical text mining [ 12] to sentiment analysis [ 13], as well as ﬁnance [ 14].
