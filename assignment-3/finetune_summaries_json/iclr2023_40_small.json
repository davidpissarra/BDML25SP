We further provide a utility option for the recom- mender system to focus on saving CO2 emissions or energy costs, or both. The empirical results show that while focusing on the reduction of CO2 emissions, the system provides an average of 12% of emission savings and 7% of electricity cost savings. When concentrating on energy costs, 6% of emission savings and 20% of electricity cost savings are possible for the studied households. 1 I NTRODUCTION The energy consumption of private households amounts to approximately 30% of the total global energy consumption (Allouhi et al., 2015), causing a large share of the CO2 emissions through en- ergy production. Increasing the efficiency of energy consumption through managing the demand, for instance through load shifting, is a feasible way to reduce CO2 emissions. For the practical implementation of load shifting, private households require data-driven decision support. Recom- mendation systems provide a framework by suggesting energy-efficient actions. Existing literature on recommender systems for load shifting in residential houses mainly focuses on rescheduling the device usage (Marinakis & Doukas, 2018; Khalid et al., 2019; Fioretto et al., 2017). However, recommending residents when to use appliances does not resonate with the way people spend their time at home. The domestic use of energy is a result of deeply embedded social practices (Katzeff & Wangel, 2015), which can be depicted as activities (i.e., cooking, laundering). Dwellers can more easily understand and follow the recommendations on shifting their activities instead of devices (Stankovic et al., 2016). Only a few works explore activity-aware systems and recommend the shifting of domestic activities corresponding to energy-consuming devices (Marcello & Pilloni, 2020; Thomas & Cook, 2016). However, these works rely on various sensor data with activity labels. The high amount of sensors increases the implementation effort and costs in real-life applications and burdens users with the requirement of tracking their activities for a sufficient amount of time. This research focuses on human-centered energy-efficiency improvements in residential households to tackle climate change. In particular, we propose an activity prediction framework for a multi- agent recommendation system to nudge behavioral changes. We summarize our key contributions as follows. First, we design and implement an Activity Agent that calculates the activity probabilities for every hour in contrast to other works that utilize daily device-usage probabilities (Jim ´enez-Bravo et al., 2019; Riabchuk et al., 2022; Zharova et al., 2022). The resulting activity-shifting schedule is based on social practices from the users’ domestic life. Therefore, recommendations can be easier integrated into daily life, fostering the acceptance and usage of the system over a longer period. Second, aiming at practical deployment, we suggest a measure to evaluate the Activity Agent’s performance without ground truth data. Third, we enhance the prediction power of the system by utilizing Random Forest (RF) and feed-forward Neural Network (NN) algorithms in comparison to ∗Corresponding author. 1the benchmark model in Riabchuk et al. (2022). Fourth, to produce recommendations, our system needs minimal user input, and appliance-level energy consumption data (i.e., from low-cost smart plugs) and does not require activity labels or other sensors, thus, reducing the implementation costs. With this, the system solves the cold start problem in two to six months for most households. Finally, we provide a utility option to focus on saving CO2 emissions or energy costs, or both. 2 M ETHODS Our activity-based recommendation system builds upon the architecture of [9] that includes six agents: Price Agent (collects external electricity price data), Preprocessing Agent (prepares the ap- pliance energy consumption data), Load Agent (generates device load profiles), Availability Agent (produces hourly probabilities of user availability), Usage Agent (calculates daily device usage prob- abilities), and Recommendation Agent (generates a device-shifting schedule for the next 24 hours). However, the recommendation system by Riabchuk et al. (2022) generates device-usage recom- mendations without considering activities and, thus, does not resonate with the social practices of domestic life. In this work, we propose an activity prediction framework for the multi-agent recommendation system (see Figure 1). First, we divide the activities into three groups referring to their flexibility to shift starting hours: flexible, slightly flexible, and inflexible. Flexible activities can be easily brought forward or postponed to later (i.e., cleaning), slightly flexible have a certain potential to be shifted but not throughout the whole recommendation horizon (i.e., entertaining), and inflexible are bound to certain starting hours (i.e., working). During the installation of the system, the user has to specify which household devices correspond to which activities. Using the user input, the system creates an activity-device\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It also offers a utility option to prioritize saving CO2 emissions or energy costs, or both. The empirical results show that focusing on CO2 emissions leads to an average of 12% emission savings and 7% electricity cost savings. In contrast, prioritizing energy costs results in 6% emission savings and 20% electricity cost savings for the studied households.\n\nThe energy consumption of private households accounts for approximately 30% of the total global energy consumption (Allouhi et al., 2015), leading to a significant share of CO2 emissions through energy production. To reduce these emissions, managing energy demand through load shifting is a feasible approach. This requires data-driven decision support for private households, which can be provided by recommendation systems. Existing literature on recommender systems for load shifting in residential houses primarily focuses on rescheduling device usage (Marinakis & Doukas, 2018; Khalid et al., 2019; Fioretto et al., 2017). However, recommending device usage does not align with how people spend their time at home, as energy consumption is deeply embedded in social practices (Katzeff & Wangel, 2015). These practices can be represented as activities, such as cooking or laundry. Users can more easily understand and follow recommendations on shifting activities rather than devices (Stankovic et al., 2016).\n\nOnly a few studies have explored activity-aware systems that recommend shifting domestic activities corresponding to energy-consuming devices (Marcello & Pilloni, 2020; Thomas & Cook, 2016).
