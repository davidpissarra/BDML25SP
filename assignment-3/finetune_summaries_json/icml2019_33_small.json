However, naive deployment of SAI has been shown in simu- lation to produce highly adversarial regional climatic effects in regions such as India and West Africa (Ricke, 2010). A lack of regulation would allow countries to trigger SAI uni- laterally, i.e. China, Russia or the US could decide to ﬁx their own climates and disrupt the ITCZ, which inﬂuences the monsoon over India, as collateral damage. If geoengi- neering is ceased before the anthropogenic radiative forcing it is sought to compensate for has declined, termination ef- fects with rapid warming would result, creating generational injustice (Jones, 2013). Understanding both how SAI can be optimised and how to best react to rogue injections is therefore of crucial geostrategic interest (Yu, 2015). In this paper, we argue that optimal SAI control can be characterised as a high-dimensional Markov Decision Pro- cess (MDP) (Bellman, 1957). This motivates the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) (Mnih, 2015) in order to automatically discover non-trivial, and potentially time- varying, optimal injection policies or identify catastrophic ones. To overcome the inherent sample inefﬁciency of DRL, we propose to emulate a Global Circulation Model (GCM) using deep learning techniques.

Recently, the advent of deep learning has led to a number of successful emulation attempts of full GCMs used for weather prediction (D ¨uben, 2018), as well as for sub-grid scale processes (Brenowitz, 2018; Rasp, 2018), including precipitation (O’Gorman, 2018). This suggests that the emulation of the response of regional variables, such as precipitation and surface temperature, to aerosol injection forcings may now be within reach. Investigation of optimal SAI control within the climate com- munity is currently constrained to low-dimensional injection pattern parametrisations (Ban-Weiss & Caldeira, 2010) or manual grid search over edge cases of interest (Jackson, 2015). Even in simple settings, it has been shown that re- gional climate response is sensitive to the choice of SAI pol- icy (MacMartin, 2013). In addition, super-regional impacts on El Nino/Southern Oscillation have been demonstrated (Gabriel, 2015). This suggests that climate response to SAI is sensitive enough to warrant a high-dimensional treatment. Altering the injection altitude, latitude, season, or parti- cle type - possibly even with the use of specially engi- neered photophoretic nanoparticles (Keith, 2010) - may pro- vide the ability to ”tailor” ﬁne-grained SAI. But, presently, stratospheric aerosol models have substantially different responses to identical injection strategies (Pitari, 2014), sug- gesting directly simulating the implications of these strate- gies - and the range of aerosol distributions that can be attained - requires further model development. 3. GCM emulation We use HadCM3 (Gordon, 2000) to simulate the climate response to SAI as it is the ﬁrst GCM not to require ﬂux adjustments to avoid large scale climate drift. In addition, HadCM3 is still used as a baseline model for IPCC reports (IPCC, 2013). The radiative forcing of sulfate aerosols is emulated in HadCM3 by adjusting the aerosol optical depth (AOD) in the lower stratosphere, i.e. a larger AOD corresponds to a larger sulfate aerosol concentration. Predominantly zonal winds in the stratosphere are assumed to keep aerosol opti- cal depth zonally uniform to ﬁrst order, so it is prescribed for each of the model’s 73latitude bands.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nIn 2014, Smith (2018) noted that naive deployment of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) can produce significant regional climatic effects in areas such as India and West Africa (Ricke, 2010). Without regulation, countries like China, Russia, or the US could unilaterally decide to alter their climates and disrupt the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ), which affects the monsoon over India, as a byproduct. If geoengineering is stopped before the anthropogenic radiative forcing it aims to compensate for has decreased, termination effects with rapid warming would occur, leading to intergenerational injustice (Jones, 2013). Understanding how SAI can be optimized and how to respond to rogue injections is crucial for geostrategic reasons (Yu, 2015). This paper argues that optimal SAI control can be characterized as a high-dimensional Markov Decision Process (MDP) (Bellman, 1957). This motivates the use of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) (Mnih, 2015) to automatically discover non-trivial, and potentially time-varying, optimal injection policies or identify catastrophic ones. To overcome the inherent sample inefficiency of DRL, we propose emulating a Global Circulation Model (GCM) using deep learning techniques.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first proposed application of deep reinforcement learning to the climate sciences. \n\n2.

We also assume that the aerosol optical depth is uniform in the vertical direction."
