This is a novel avenue of research, as previous work has focused on NPs for long-term forecasting. We compare a multi-task neural process (MTNP) to an ensemble of independent single-task NPs (STNP) and to an ensemble of Gaussian processes (GPs). We use time series data for multiple weather attributes from Chichester Harbour over a one-week period. We evaluate performance in terms of NLL and MSE with 2-hours and 6-hours time horizons. When limited context information is provided, the MTNP leverages inter-task knowledge and outperforms the STNP. The STNP outperforms both the MTNP and the GPs ensemble when a sufficient, but not exceeding, amount of context information is provided. 1 I NTRODUCTION Forecasting from time series data is of key relevance in the field of climate science. Data from multiple sensors records various correlated weather attributes. Modelling short-term dynamics is of particular interest to detect unexpected weather conditions, potentially precursors of extreme events and disasters such as flooding and high winds. Traditional methods for weather forecasting include classical statistical forecast methods and numerical weather prediction models. These approaches rely on complex physical models and generating forecasts is expensive both in terms of time and computation power. In recent years there has been a surge in the use of machine learning models in climate sciences (Rolnick et al. (2019)), as they offer a more data-driven approach, identifying patterns in historical climate data to aid future predictions. Efficient models based on deep neural network architectures are a promising alternative for weather modelling (Espeholt et al. (2021)). These models can produce more timely weather predictions than traditional weather forecasting models and they can be used for short-term forecasting. Some of the machine learning models proposed for precipitation forecasting include using a U-Net with radar images (Agrawal et al. (2019)) and treating forecasting as an image-to-image translation problem, MetNet (SÃ¸nderby et al. (2020)), which uses input radar and satellite data to produce a probabilistic precipitation map, and MetNet-2 (Espeholt et al. (2021)). These models use images to forecast precipitations, whereas in our work we use time series weather attributes data. We investigate how neural processes (NPs) (Garnelo et al. (2018a;b)) can be used for short-term forecasting, providing both expectation and uncertainty estimates over a range of weather-related variables. It was shown in Kim et al. (2022) that simultaneous learning a set of correlated tasks can help to leverage information from their joint distribution. This is useful when data is insufficient to 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Tide height (m) weather attribute time series, with the train-validation-test splits.

We compare a multi-task neural process (MTNP), which learns a joint distribution of multiple weather attributes, to an ensemble of single-task neural processes (STNPs) and to an ensemble of GPs. Kim et al. (2022) have used MTNPs for long-term weather forecasts at multiple locations, while our work focuses on short-term forecasting at a single location, from a week of time series data collected by a set of weather, sea state and environment sensors. We present preliminary results on using NPs for short-term forecasting multiple weather attributes. We observe that when the context information is insufficient, the MTNP leverages knowledge from related attributes to predict the dynamics. The STNP outperforms both the MTNP and the ensemble of GPs when limited but sufficient context information is provided. 2 M ETHODOLOGY Data Thechimet dataset was collected from the Chichester Harbour in the United Kingdom, between the 17th and the 23rd of August 2007. The weather attributes recorded at the location are: air temperature (C),max wave height (m),mean wave height (m),sea temperature (C),tide height (m), wind gust speed (kn) andwind speed (kn). As the readings are of various physical properties, they are naturally co-related by the physics of weather systems. Figures of the time series are in Appendix A. The readings from the multiple sensors are taken at roughly 1 min intervals, but the sampling is not exact. We cast time series forecasting as a multi-task meta-learning problem, where each weather attribute corresponds to a task.

Multiple sensors record various correlated weather attributes, making short-term dynamics modeling particularly interesting for detecting unexpected weather conditions, which can be precursors to extreme events and disasters such as flooding and high winds. Traditional weather forecasting methods include classical statistical forecast methods and numerical weather prediction models, which rely on complex physical models and are expensive in terms of time and computation power.\n\nIn recent years, machine learning models have gained popularity in climate sciences, offering a data-driven approach to identify patterns in historical climate data and aid future predictions. Deep neural network architectures are a promising alternative for weather modeling, producing more timely weather predictions than traditional models and suitable for short-term forecasting.\n\nSome machine learning models proposed for precipitation forecasting include using a U-Net with radar images and treating forecasting as an image-to-image translation problem, such as MetNet and MetNet-2.

Our results show that when limited context information is provided, the MTNP leverages knowledge from related attributes to predict the dynamics. However, when sufficient but not excessive context information is provided, the STNP outperforms both the MTNP and the GP ensemble."
