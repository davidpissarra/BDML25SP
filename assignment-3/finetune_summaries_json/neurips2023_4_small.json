To address this inherent limitation, we introduce an innovative model-agnostic Cloud Adaptive- Labeling (CAL ) approach, which operates iteratively to enhance the quality of training data annotations and consequently improve the performance of the learned model. Our methodology commences by training a cloud segmentation model using the original annotations. Subsequently, it introduces a trainable pixel intensity threshold for adaptively labeling the cloud training images on the fly. The newly generated labels are then employed to fine-tune the model. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple standard cloud segmentation benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in significantly boosting the performance of existing segmentation models. Our CAL method establishes new state-of-the-art results when compared to a wide array of existing alternatives. 1 Introduction Cloud understanding is indicative and critical in climate science, with significant application in various sectors like renewable energy, disaster management, and environmental monitoring [ 1]. A viable and scalable approach to this problem is leveraging remote sensing imagery data to examine the patterns and characteristics of clouds over space and time. To that end, cloud segmentation is one of the most fine-grained methods. Traditionally, cloud segmentation primarily employed threshold-based techniques, hinging on pre- existing knowledge and the distinction between Earth’s surface and clouds [ 2]. Nevertheless, these methods exhibited vulnerability to intricate backgrounds, thereby constraining their efficacy. Addi- tionally, the selection of the threshold in such methods typically entailed subjective human judgment and expertise, resulting in performance disparities [3]. Recently, deep learning approaches have emerged as promising alternatives to threshold-based methods. They excel in capturing intricate patterns and leveraging extensive datasets, resulting in significant enhancements in cloud segmentation accuracy [ 4]. Deep learning mitigates the reliance on subjective thresholding while adapting effectively to diverse atmospheric conditions and complex cloud formations [5].

(a) A random training image; (b) The original cloud mask label; (c) The mask label obtained using our proposed method. Nonetheless, all the previous methods typically assume the availability of accurate mask annotations of cloud, which is often largely invalid (see Figure 1 (a)). Making this assumption could generally lead to degraded model performance, but it is still understudied in the literature. In this paper, we propose an innovative model-agnostic Cloud Adaptive-Labeling (CAL ) method to address the mentioned fundamental challenge. Our approach starts by training a cloud segmentation model using the original noisy training data. Subsequently, it introduces a trainable pixel intensity threshold for adaptively labeling the training images on the fly. The newly generated labels are then employed to fine-tune the model. Importantly, our pixel intensity threshold is dynamically adjusted through an intuitive self-regulating mechanism in response to the evolving training loss: it increases when the loss decreases and decreases when it increases. This objective-oriented thresholding strategy challenges the conventional notion of a single optimal threshold and obviates the necessity for prior threshold estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method iteratively enhances the quality of training data annotations, leading to improvements in model performance and achieving the new state of the art on a standard cloud segmentation benchmark. 2 Related work Existing cloud segmentation techniques are categorized into three groups: Threshold-based, Machine learning-based, and Deep learning-based. Threshold-based methods rely on differences in scattering intensity between clouds and atmospheric particles in specific spectral bands [ 6]. The spectral threshold approach is effective when combined with multi-band features like radiance, reflectance, and normalized vegetation index [ 7,8,9]. These methods work well only when clouds have high visible reflection and cooler infrared temperatures compared to the Earth’s surface. However, their performance depends on prior knowledge and the contrast between clouds and the Earth’s surface. Despite their effectiveness, threshold-based methods struggle to distinguish clouds in the presence of atmospheric aerosols, dust, smoke, and hazy pixels caused by small-scale cumulus clouds or cloud edges [3]. To address the limitations of threshold-based approaches, following-up works employed machine learning algorithms, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and random forests [ 10,11], leveraging texture features extracted from remote sensing images as input [ 12,13]. However, these methods heavily depended on manually crafted features. Recent advancements have witnessed the adoption of deep learning techniques in cloud segmentation, with subsequent efforts focused on enhancing network architecture and deep feature extraction [ 14,15,16]. For instance, Yao et al. [ 17] introduced attention modules and boundary refinement blocks to comprehensively capture multi-scale context. While deep learning-based cloud detection methods exhibit significant advantages over threshold- based and traditional machine learning approaches, their outstanding performance hinges on the availability of extensive, high-quality pixel-level cloud masks [ 18]. Nevertheless, the creation of such datasets is a challenging and time-consuming endeavor, often resulting in the presence of substantial noisy labels that can introduce uncertainties and negatives into research outcomes (\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
