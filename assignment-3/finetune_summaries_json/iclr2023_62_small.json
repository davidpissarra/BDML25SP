To overcome this issue, battery energy storage systems (BESS) can serve as onsite backup sources for solar farms. However, the backup role of the BESS significantly limits its eco- nomic value, disincentivizing the BESS deployment due to high investment costs. Hence, it is essential to effectively reduce solar curtailment while ensuring viable operations of the BESS. To better understand the synergy of a co-located solar- BESS system in the real-time electricity market, we model the cooperative bidding processes of the solar farm and the BESS as a Markov game. We use a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL) algorithm, known as multi-agent deep de- terministic policy gradient, to concurrently maximize the overall revenue from the electricity market and reduce solar curtailments. We validate our MADRL-based strategy using data from a realistic solar farm operating in the Australian electric- ity market. The simulation results show that our MADRL-based coordinated bid- ding strategy outperforms both optimization-based and DRL-based benchmarks, generating higher revenue for the BESS and reducing more solar curtailments. Our work highlights the importance of coordination between the BESS and re- newable generations for both economic benefits and progress towards net-zero transitions. 1 I NTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND As we move towards a net-zero emission future, renewable energy resources have been increasingly adopted in modern power systems for decarbonization and climate change mitigation (Lu et al. (2021)). In particular, solar photovoltaic (PV) has become the leading source of utility-scale renew- ables (Comello & Reichelstein (2019)) due to its declining levelized electricity costs and convenient facilitation. Solar energy has attracted about half of the global renewable investment and contributed the most net added generation capacity in the past decade, with its installed capacity increasing from 304.3GW in 2016 to 760.4GW in 2020 worldwide (IEA (2020)). However, the stochastic nature of solar irradiation leads to a high degree of variability in solar PV generation, subsequently causing power supply-demand imbalances and oversupply during the daytime, in particular when the solar ∗Corresponding author: Hao Wang.

Solar curtailment is often inevitable to ensure the secure operation of power systems, but leads to substantial economic losses and emerges as a new challenge for net-zero transitions (Mallapragada et al. (2020)). Flexible energy resources are needed to address the solar curtailment challenge (Frew et al. (2021)). Battery energy storage systems (BESS) have been increasingly facilitated and co-located with solar farms as a flexible resource for reducing solar curtailments and improving the economic performance of solar farms (Hernandez et al. (2015); Chu et al. (2017); Bumpus & Comello (2017)). In a co- located solar-BESS system, the BESS is usually used as the backup source to smooth the fluctuating solar PV generation by drawing excess solar energy (otherwise to be curtailed) from the onsite solar farm and releasing stored energy in the event of solar shortages (Wang et al. (2014)). The investment cost of the BESS remains significant, despite experiencing a decrease in the past decades. The cost- effective integration of the BESS into solar farms through optimal placement and sizing has been studied in Babacan et al. (2017); Khezri et al. (2020); Hassan et al. (2022). However, when the BESS is only used for reducing solar curtailments, its flexibility has not been fully exploited, limiting the full economic potential of the BESS in the electricity market (Mallapragada et al. (2020)). The BESS can take advantage of its operational flexibility to perform energy arbitrage (i.e., buy low and sell high) in the wholesale electricity market, as a prospective revenue stream for the BESS in addition to the ancillary role of reducing solar curtailment. Hence, it is of great significance to design an effective coordination strategy for the co-located solar-BESS system to simultaneously reduce solar curtailment and improve the BESS’s economic viability, benefiting not only the solar farms and the BESS, but also the power system by reducing carbon emissions and promoting climate change mitigation. However, designing such an effective coordination strategy is not trivial due to the variability of solar PV generation and the\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
