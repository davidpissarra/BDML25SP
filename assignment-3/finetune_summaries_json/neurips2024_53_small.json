CLEAN captures global patterns between energy structures and sectoral carbon emissions, enabling accurate energy-emission predictions at national, provincial, city, and sectoral levels. By framing the problem as a bidirectional supervised regression task, our model achieves a Mean Absolute Percentage Error of approximately 5%, significantly outperforming traditional models like XGBoost, especially with our novel data augmentation method, Densify. This demonstrates CLEAN’s superior performance and generalization capabilities, making it a powerful tool for climate policy analysis. The CMEE dataset, CLEAN model, and Densify augmentation methods are open-sourced at https://github.com/Yvnminc/CLEAN. 1 Introduction The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7 calls for a global shift to affordable and clean energy, emphasizing its role in reducing dependence on fossil fuels and highlighting the broader environmental and economic benefits of sustainable energy [ 3,23]. In alignment with this objective, the Paris Agreement was established with the ambitious target of keeping the global temperature rise well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels [ 17,9]. This commitment has led countries worldwide to implement substantial energy and industrial transition policies [5, 12, 15]. Traditional policy-making in this context often relies on economic models like Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models [ 24,26]. While these models offer a structured approach to understanding economic outcomes, they are built on simplified assumptions and static frameworks [1, 19, 7]. As a result, they fall short in capturing the complex, dynamic interactions between energy systems and markets, and they lack the flexibility to adapt to varying future scenarios [ 14,18]. This limitation poses significant challenges for climate policy development, which requires adaptive strategies to accommodate long-term goals, such as the commitment of many developed nations to achieve net- zero emissions by 2050. The uncertainties inherent in a 30-year planning horizon further complicate the creation of effective policies, as they must account for unpredictable technological, economic, and social changes [21, 6, 20]. 2 Pathway Impact of Machine Learning for Climate Policy Making This research focuses on a data-driven machine-learning approach. The proposed model, CLEAN for climate policy-making, demonstrates clear advantages and impactful pathways over CGE models Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: The Cycle Learning Energy-Emission Assessment Network (CLEAN) framework predicts national-level energy demand and emissions based on energy mix and sectoral emission structure. This model learns global patterns from the Carbon Monitor Energy-Emission dataset across scales, offering insights for policy formulation and feasibility assessments. [22,27,25]. Specifically, unlike CGE models, which are limited by their static assumptions and localized scope. CLEAN identifies scalable global patterns across national, provincial, city, and sectoral. By understanding that a nation’s energy profile is an aggregate of its sectors, CLEAN effec- tively captures how different energy mixes influence total carbon emissions and how sector-specific emissions contribute to the overall energy demand. CLEAN demonstrates high generalization ability for various downstream prediction tasks. It can predict daily emissions for unseen countries where direct emissions data is unavailable by using accessible power generation data. CLEAN supports bidirectional prediction for policy simulation. The model is designed to help determine the optimal energy mix required to meet specific emission reduction targets, automatically identifying a feasible energy structure. This capability is crucial for developing sustainable energy policies and ensuring that emission goals are both realistic and achievable. 3 Carbon Monitor Energy-Emission Time Series Data Table 1: Detail Information of Carbon Monitor Energy-Emission (CMEE) Time Series Dataset. Characteristics Number Description Spatial Coverage 12 Regions (e.g. China, France, United States) Temporal Coverage 2008 Daily granularity from 01/01/2019 to 30/06/2024 Energy Type 8 Energy source (e.g. Coal, Gas, Solar) Emission Type 6 Secotral emission (e.g. Transportation, Industry, Power) We have developed a comprehensive, high-resolution Energy-Emission time series dataset CMEE based on the Carbon Monitor project to understand the relationship between power generation and CO2emissions, which is crucial for evaluating national energy and sectorial transition policies. The Carbon Monitor is an international initiative providing regularly updated, science-based estimates of daily carbon emissions and power generation data for 12 countries, covering the period from January 1, 2019, to June 30, 2024 [ 13,10]. Our dataset includes data on eight types of energy sources and six categories of sectoral emissions, spanning a total of 24,096 days (2,008 days each for 12 countries). It integrates two independently collected but related datasets, ensuring consistency through structured formatting and noise reduction techniques such as Gaussian filtering. This unified dataset serves as a robust foundation for machine learning tasks and supports further research, including data mining, causal analysis, and time series forecasting.
