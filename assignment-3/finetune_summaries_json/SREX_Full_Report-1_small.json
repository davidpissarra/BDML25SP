As a result, changes in the frequency and se verity of the physical events affect disaster risk, but so do the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulne rability. Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude, but populations and assets at risk h ave also increased, with consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters  exist or can be developed at any scale, local to international. Some strategies for effectively managing risks and adapting to climate c hange involve adjustments to current activities. Others require transformation or fundamental change.  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change, in cluding the physical science of climate; impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability; and mitigation of climate change. The IPCC was establi shed by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with acomprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge of climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomicimpacts.Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Edited by Christopher B.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text, removing noisy characters and formatting while keeping the essential content:\n\nAs a result of changes in frequency and severity of physical events, disaster risk is affected. However, the spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability also play a significant role. Some types of extreme weather and climate events have increased in frequency or magnitude, but populations and assets at risk have also increased, leading to consequences for disaster risk. Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters exist at any scale, from local to international.\n\nManaging these risks and adapting to climate change require adjustments to current activities or fundamental changes. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for assessing climate change, including its physical science, impacts, adaptation, and vulnerability, as well as mitigation. The IPCC was established by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts.\n\nThe IPCC's Special Report, \"Managing the Risks of Extreme Events and Disasters to Advance Climate Change Adaptation,\" was edited by Christopher B. Field and co-chairs Thomas F. Stocker, Qin Dahe, Vicente Barros, and others. The report was published by Cambridge University Press in 2012.\n\nThe report is divided into several sections, including a foreword, summary for policymakers, and chapters on climate change, determinants of risk, changes in climate extremes, and managing risks at the local, national, and international levels. The report also includes case studies and annexes with author and reviewer information, a glossary of terms, and other supplementary materials.\n\nKey points from the report include:\n\n- Changes in frequency and severity of physical events affect disaster risk.\n- Spatially diverse and temporally dynamic patterns of exposure and vulnerability also impact disaster risk.\n- Opportunities for managing risks of weather- and climate-related disasters exist at any scale.\n- Managing these risks and adapting to climate change require adjustments to current activities or fundamental changes.\n- The IPCC is the leading international body for assessing climate change and its impacts.\n- The report provides a comprehensive assessment of the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts."
