Generating the hydro- gen feedstock with renewable electricity through water electrolysis is an option that would allow retroﬁtting the billions of dollars of invested cap- ital in Haber-Bosch production capacity. Eco- nomic viability is however strongly dependent on the relative regional prices of methane and renewable energy; renewables have been trend- ing lower in cost but forecasting methane prices is difﬁcult (Stehly et al., 2018; IRENA, 2017; Wainberg et al., 2017). Electrochemical ammonia production, which can use aqueous or steam H 2O as its hydrogen source (ﬁrst demonstrated ˜20 years ago) is a promising means of emissions-free ammonia production. Its viability is also linked to the relative price of renewable energy versus methane, but in principle it can be signiﬁcantly more cost-effective than Haber-Bosch (Giddey et al., 2013) and also downscale to developing areas lacking ammonia transport infrastructure (Shipman & Symes, 2017). However to date it has only been demonstrated at laboratory scales with yields and Faradaic efﬁciencies insufﬁcient to be economically competitive.

Presented at the International Conference on Machine Learning 2019 Workshop on Climate Change, Copyright 2019 by the au- thor(s).learning approaches to ﬁx this are discussed. 1. Why current approaches have failed Two distinct approaches to electrochemical ammonia pro- duction have been demonstrated to date (Kyriakou et al., 2017): ﬂuid electrocatalysis and solid-state ammonia syn- thesis (SSAS). Fluid electrocatalysis approaches use aqueous or gaseous mixes of nitrogen, hydrogen (possibly from H 2O) and elec- trolyte to reduce di-nitrogen to ammonia at catalyzed elec- trodes. The key challenge has been discovery of electrode catalysts that are preferentially selective for adsorption of nitrogen and its reduction intermediates over adsorption of oxygen or hydrogen (Singh et al., 2016; Foster et al., 2018). SSAS cells use a solid/polymer ion-conductor membrane to decrease the preferentially selective adsorption require- ment: the feedstocks are in separate chambers and the ion- conductor mediates delivery of protons, driven by electrical current. The key challenge has been ﬁnding combinations of membrane and electrode materials that have high ammo- nia yields per area/time, good Faradaic efﬁciency and that are stable (i.e. don’t melt or chemically react) in a given temperature regime (Kyriakou et al., 2017). In both approaches, relevant materials properties can be ap- proximated from ﬁrst principles. Relative adsorption ener- gies can be calculated from density functional theory (DFT) (Hoskuldsson et al., 2017). Melting point, ion-conductivity, and reactivity can all be estimated from ﬁrst principles (Seko et al., 2014; Hong & van de Walle, 2015; Pornprasertsuk et al., 2005; Chermette, 1999). However large scale com- putational screens have not been performed, due to the relatively large computational cost involved (single-digit CPU-hours for each candidate material and active-surface geometry) coupled with uncertainty about how well ﬁrst- principles calculations predict reality for any given material class (Pilania et al., 2013). 2. Filling the gap with machine-learning Machine learning (ML) models have demonstrated they are able to predict small-molecule and materials energies and properties calculated from ﬁrst-principles (Smith et al.,ML-driven search for zero-emissions ammonia production materials 2017; Gilmer et al., 2017; Xie & Grossman, 2018; Singh et al., 2019). Small molecule equilibrium structures can be auto-regressively generated (Gebauer et al., 2018): demon- stration of similar for crystal structures modeled as unit cells with periodic boundary conditions is needed because existing random/evolutionary approaches are still quite com- putationally intensive (Pickard & Needs, 2006; Glass et al., 2006). Rapid property prediction with ML models could enable screening the space of ˜34,000 plausibly stable metal oxides catalogued in the Materials Project (Jain et\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nCarbon emissions in the production of ammonia are primarily dominated by the use of methane as both an energy source and hydrogen feedstock, rather than the energy required to maintain elevated temperatures and pressures (Pfromm, 2017). One option to generate the hydrogen feedstock using renewable electricity through water electrolysis could allow for the retrofitting of the billions of dollars invested in Haber-Bosch production capacity. However, the economic viability of this approach is heavily dependent on the relative prices of methane and renewable energy, with renewable energy costs trending lower but methane prices being difficult to forecast (Stehly et al., 2018; IRENA, 2017; Wainberg et al., 2017).\n\nElectrochemical ammonia production, which can use aqueous or steam as its hydrogen source, is a promising means of emissions-free ammonia production. This method has been demonstrated to be potentially more cost-effective than Haber-Bosch and can be scaled down to developing areas lacking ammonia transport infrastructure (Shipman & Symes, 2017). However, it has only been demonstrated at laboratory scales, with yields and Faradaic efficiencies insufficient to be economically competitive. Promising machine learning approaches are being explored to address this issue.\n\nTwo distinct approaches to electrochemical ammonia production have been demonstrated: fluid electrocatalysis and solid-state ammonia synthesis (SSAS).
