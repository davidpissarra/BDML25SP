In a case study of approximately 30 buildings in Sacramento, California, we demonstrate how our hybrid physics-driven deep learning framework can use these external factors advantageously to identify a more optimal energy efﬁciency retroﬁt installation strategy and achieve signiﬁcant savings in both energy and cost. 1 Introduction Urban areas dominate contributions to anthropogenic climate change, with cities accounting for over 75 percent of greenhouse gas emissions and two-thirds of global energy use [ 5]. A prime opportunity to reduce urban greenhouse gas emissions is in the buildings sector, which is responsible for over 30 percent of greenhouse gases from energy generation [ 5]. When deployed strategically, building energy retroﬁts are widely accepted as a cost-effective way to achieve energy savings in buildings [ 6]. Engineers often rely on physics-based simulation tools to understand building energy use and to project possible energy savings under a variety of different retroﬁts. These methods tend to focus on prediction tasks for individual buildings, requiring a separate model for each building, where the time and resources required to produce each model makes it difﬁcult to model an entire urban area that municipal policymakers require to make decisions. Additionally, these models are often prone to high prediction errors because of a large number of required modeling assumptions [ 7,8]. However, emerging sophisticated time series prediction models using supervised machine learning methods have been applied to accurately predict energy consumption in buildings [ 9,10,11,12,13]. Fully data-driven approaches to predicting impacts of energy retroﬁts are difﬁcult to use in practice due to the lack of ground truth labels from buildings with comparable retroﬁts. We draw inspiration from the emergence of models that integrate physical simulations with deep learning [ 14]. Other work [15,16] has used a combination of physical simulations and machine learning to match buildings with potentially effective retroﬁts, but these models do not consider the impacts of urban context (e.g., mutual shading and reﬂection, building-to-building heat transfer) on retroﬁt efﬁcacy, which has been previously shown to signiﬁcantly inﬂuence building energy performance [17]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2020Figure 1: From left to right, 2.5D geometry and other building parameters are used by EnergyPlus to simulate energy consumption. This is the input to either the no context or with context model. The model then predicts energy consumption for the target building (in this case, building B). Here, we extend the hybrid data-driven urban energy simulation (DUE-S) model presented in [ 18] by adapting it to time series prediction tasks and enabling quantiﬁcation of potential retroﬁts. We use this new model to predict urban context-aware energy usage estimates given static physical parameters for each building in an urban area. We also isolate the effect of context to highlight its utility in retroﬁt optimization. A key advantage of our approach is the automatic identiﬁcation of buildings that can, with strategic retroﬁtting, achieve a \"multiplier effect\" by improving energy savings in other buildings via inter-building effects. Our contributions are twofold: the application of a hybrid deep learning approach to 1) account for urban context to simultaneously predict retroﬁt installation effects in multiple buildings and 2) derive a retroﬁt strategy that minimizes installation demands. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data Ground truth labels for our baseline model training consist of hourly electricity consumption data for 2016-2018 from N= 29 buildings in Sacramento, California. Buildings range in size and purpose (ofﬁce, retail, warehouse, apartment). To avoid data leakage from random shufﬂing of sequential time series data [ 19], we split the ﬁrst two years into consecutive sequences of training and validation sets with lengths in a ratio of 3:1 respectively. The last year (2018) is reserved for testing. For each ground truth label, a corresponding simulated energy consumption estimate is generated using EnergyPlus – a physics-based building energy simulation engine [ 20]. This model uses historical weather data and typical building-level information on materials, operating schedules, and mechanical systems to produce hourly predictions of energy usage by non-retroﬁtted buildings in our study period. These are based on archetypal building characteristics from DOE commercial reference buildings [ 21].
