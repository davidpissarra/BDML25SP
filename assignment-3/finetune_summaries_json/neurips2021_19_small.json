This model takes as input a sequence of weather radar mosaics and deterministically predicts future radar reﬂectivity at lead times up to 6 hours. By stacking a large input receptive ﬁeld along the feature dimension and conditioning the model’s forecaster with predictions from the physics-based High Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model, we are able to outperform optical ﬂow and HRRR baselines by 20-25% on multiple metrics averaged over all lead times. 1 Motivation Accurate short-term forecasts (“nowcasts”) of precipitation are extremely important for many aspects of people’s daily lives, as evidenced by the popularity of services such as Dark Sky. Nowcasting can also identify extreme weather events such as ﬂooding and inform mitigation strategies for these events. With such extreme events predicted to increase in frequency and intensity in a warmer future climate [1], forecasting and early warning will become even more important. Traditional forecasting methods based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, which compute solutions to differential equations governing the physics of the atmosphere, have a few disadvantages when used for nowcasting. Models such as HRRR [ 2] are computationally expensive to run at high spatial resolution, cannot predict very short-term precipitation very well due to the required spin-up time of the internal physics, and have limited predictive skill beyond a few hours [3]. Methods for predicting short-term precipitation directly from observed weather radar, including extrapolation methods like optical ﬂow and machine learning methods, have emerged as the state- of-the-art for forecasting precipitation within a few hours. [ 4] introduced the convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) architecture with good performance for radar-based precipitation nowcasting. Since then, numerous deep learning architectures and benchmark datasets have been used in a research capacity to tackle this problem [e.g. 5–10], including Google Research’s MetNet [11], which compares favorably against the physics-based HRRR. Despite the promising performance of deep-learning-based nowcasting, few providers have im- plemented such systems for operations. We present MS-nowcasting, a ConvLSTM-based model designed for operational efﬁciency that now powers Microsoft Weather’s nowcasting maps and notiﬁcations in the US and Europe. Our model has several notable improvements over prior work in precipitation nowcasting, including a novel method to ingest a large spatial input receptive ﬁeld, and leveraging physics-based HRRR predictions to condition the model’s forecaster component. Our Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: ConvLSTM encoder-forecaster architecture. design strategies allow MS-nowcasting to run on as little hardware as a single graphics processing unit (GPU). Using only 8 GPUs in production, the model latency for forecasts over the entire US is under two minutes from radar data availability. End-to-end, consumers can enjoy high-quality radar forecast maps within about 6 minutes from the time of radar measurements. 2 Model To target the goal of delivering the best on the market model accuracy and refresh rate while keeping computational resource requirements to a minimum, we needed to make a few key model design choices. For instance, we needed to avoid expensive operations such as attention mechanism performing O(n2)operations on tensors. While [ 11] employed the faster approach of axial attention [12], it necessitated using 256 Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) running in parallel. We decided to leverage existing ConvLSTM architecture ﬁrst developed in [ 4] and enhanced in [ 5], but with some adjustments. Our changes to the original model include adding forecaster conditioning based on an NWP model, adding a large viewport of input spatial information in an atypical manner, tuning hyperparameters, weighting of the hidden states, and optimizer changes. Our model is a three-layer encoder-forecaster network. The input to the model consists of a sequence ofTiimages of weather radar reﬂectivity (a proxy for precipitation intensity) from the Multi-Radar Multi-Sensor dataset [MRMS, 13], with shape [B; Ti; C; H i; Wi]and the target is a sequence of Toradar frames, with shape [B; To;1; Ho; Wo]. We perform down convolutions followed by leaky ReLU activations before encoder layers and up convolutions followed by leaky ReLU after forecaster layers similar to [ 5]. We keep the original ConvLSTM cell instead of methods like TrajGRU and ConvGRU as we found the latter did not provide signiﬁcant beneﬁts for our problem. Inside this ConvLSTM cell, we perform group normalization after performing the convolutions. This modiﬁed version of the ConvLSTM cell is referred to as RNN in Figure 1. Exact hyperparameters of the model architecture can be found in Table 3 in Appendix B. Nowcasting models and benchmarks often rely\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
