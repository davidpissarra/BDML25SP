To mitigate the climate and health impact of the kiln industry, ﬁne-grained kiln localization at different geographic loca- tions is needed. Kiln localization using multi-spectral remote sensing data such as vegetation index results in a noisy estimates whereas use of high-resolution imagery is infeasible due to cost and compute complexities. This paper proposes a fusion of spatio-temporal multi-spectral data with high-resolution imagery for detection of brick kilns within the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia. We ﬁrst per- form classiﬁcation using low-resolution spatio-temporal multi-spectral data from Sentinel-2 imagery by combining vegetation, burn, build up and moisture indices. Then orientation aware object detector: YOLOv3 (with \u0012value) is implemented for removal of false detections and ﬁne-grained localization. Our proposed tech- nique, when compared with other benchmarks, results in a 21\u0002improvement in speed with comparable or higher accuracy when tested over multiple countries. 1 P ATH TO CLIMATE IMPACT Industrial air pollution has a direct health impact and is a major contributor to climate change. Unregulated small-scale informal industries spread across vast areas are common in resource-limited settings and can be difﬁcult to locate and monitor. Remote identiﬁcation of kilns and monitoring of their carbon production can assist air pollution surveillance, regulation, and climate mitigation efforts. The exact numbering and location of kilns is needed to understand and address the kiln sector’s climate and health impacts. 2 I NTRODUCTION Vehicles and industries are considered as one of the major contributors of pollution resulting low air quality and smog Haque et al. (2022). According to an estimate 20% of global black carbon emission is from the brick kilns Maithel (2014). These kilns are also a major source of employment, however according to the Global Slavery Index of 2019, approximately 60% (24:3millions) of the modern day slaves are within the “Brick-Kiln-Belt” of South Asia (between Afghanistan and Nepal) Landman & Silverman (2019). Keeping in view the UN’s Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3:9and8:7which speciﬁcally aims to address air pollution and forced labor respectively, mapping brick kilns in the South Asia is an essential ﬁrst step. Manual surveying of “Brick-Kiln-Belt” is infeasible due to the large area ( 1;551;997km2) as well as geographic boundaries.
