    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nWeather events such as temperature anomalies are influenced by various factors. In Western and Central Europe, soils typically contain sufficient water to sustain high evaporation and limit surface sensible heating. However, a decrease in soil moisture has been observed in recent years, leading to soil-moisture temperature feedbacks that can amplify hot extremes beyond greenhouse gas-induced global warming.\n\nCausal discovery methods can identify the underlying causal relationships between climate variables to discern the factors contributing to unusual weather patterns. We frame the problem of uncovering soil moisture drivers in Western Europe using regime-specific causal discovery and apply Regime-PCMCI, implemented in the Tigramite Python package.\n\nData with distribution shifts, such as anomalies, can have periods during which the data exhibits different statistical patterns. Each regime is characterized by its own set of statistical properties, with the \"normal\" causal structure or causal mechanisms altered, resulting in different regimes governing the \"normal\" and \"anomalous\" state.\n\nWe model each regime using a structural causal model (SCM), assuming an exogenous variable R describes the NK regimes. The regime-specific SCM for regime k at time t is written as Xk,t = fk(Pak,Xt, Uk,t - Pak,Xt-1), where Xt is the vector of variables that are direct causes of Xi,t, and Uk,t is exogenous noise.\n\nRegime-PCMCI builds upon the PCMCI algorithm, which uses an independence-testing approach adapted to the time-series case for constraint-based causal discovery and orients edges from past to future. Regime-PCMCI finds a regime assignment for each sample by alternating between two steps:\n\n1. Discovering regime-specific causal graphs using PCMCI, starting with a random assignment of regimes.\n2. Detecting regimes: At iteration q, predict Xk,tq using parents Pak(Xk,t, Θt) and predict the regime labels γk using the distance between the real and predicted data, subject to constraints (1) and (2), where NC is the number of transitions between regimes (user-defined).\n\nThe dataset contains daily values for the time period 1950-2022 in Western Europe, including:\n\n- Mean air temperature 2m above ground (T2m)\n- Root-zone (1m) soil moisture (SM)\n- Surface sensible heat flux (SH)\n- Surface latent heat flux (LH)\n- Large-scale circulation function at 250 hPa (Stream)\n- Shortwave downward radiation (SW)\n- The vegetation-atmosphere coupling (VAC) index, computed using thresholding of SM and T2m anomalies."
