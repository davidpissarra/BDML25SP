However, such stream- flow data are commonly plagued with missing observations due to various causes such as harsh environmental condi- tions and constrained operational resources. This problem is often more pervasive in under-resourced areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa. In this work, we reconstruct streamflow time series data through bias correction of the GEOGloWS ECMWF streamflow service (GESS) forecasts at ten river gauging stations in Benin Republic. We perform bias cor- rection by fitting Quantile Mapping, Gaussian Process, and Elastic Net regression in a constrained training period. We show by simulating missingness in a testing period that GESS forecasts have a significant bias that results in low predic- tive skill over the ten Beninese stations. Our findings sug- gest that overall bias correction by Elastic Net and Gaussian Process regression achieves superior skill relative to tradi- tional imputation by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbour, and GESS lookup. The findings of this work provide a basis for integrating global GESS streamflow data into operational early-warning decision-making systems (e.g., flood alert) in countries vulnerable to drought and flooding due to extreme weather events. Introduction Discharge predictions are critical for decision-making in many areas of climate change adaptation, including flood and drought prevention, agricultural planning, and hydro- electric power system operations (Kratzert et al. 2019). Pre- dictions can be generated by physical and statistical models of the hydrological process within the river basin (Adounkpe et al. 2021). Regardless of the approach, observation data is required to sufficiently calibrate the localised dynamics within catchments. Model-based predictions are even more essential in vulnerable and under-developed regions that are less resilient to extreme weather events such as drought and flooding. However, localised observations for hydrological Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Physical sensor systems of- ten endure harsh environmental conditions, destruction and power outages (Tencaliec et al. 2015). These phenomena re- sult in prolonged periods of missing or invalid observation readings. In developing regions such as Benin Republic, the effect of such missing data is further complemented by the already sparse distribution of stream gauging stations (Har- rigan et al. 2020a). Fitting statistical models based on in- complete observation data results in inaccurate models that do not capture the full dynamics of the underlying hydrolog- ical processes (Hamzah et al. 2020). A more complete set of streamflow data allows for greater confidence in the outputs of hydrological models (Pigott 2001). Impuation of miss- ing data therefore leads to much needed improved flood and drought predictions in a climate change context where these events are expected to increase in intensity and frequency (Kalantari et al. 2018). Thus missing data imputation has be- come a necessary first step in data preprocessing tasks (Pig- ott 2001). Moreover, missing observations and the estima- tion of streamflow at ungauged locations are two of the most pervasive problems in the field of hydrology (Hamzah et al. 2020). Since the area of missing data imputation commands a relatively vast amount of statistical literature, a wide va- riety of techniques have been developed and applied with different data requirements and accuracy (Little and Rubin 2019). A simple approach to handling missing data is discarding records where any missingness arises. Gill et al. (2007) show that while deletion of missing data is common practice in hy- drology, it is not necessarily optimal as significant amounts of predictive information can be lost. On the other hand, sin- gle imputation methods attempt to replace missing values one feature at a time with a pre-specified summary statistic (e.g. mean or median) of the complete data (Baraldi and En- ders 2010). Regression-based methods such as imputation by Random Forest, k-Nearest Neighbours and Multilayer perceptrons improve upon single imputation by exploiting correlations between variables in complete data (Gao 2017; Pantanowitz and Marwala 2009). Both regression and singleimputation can lead to biases in the resultant analysis when\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
