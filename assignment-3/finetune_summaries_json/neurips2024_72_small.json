Our preliminary results derived using Monte Carlo sampling and parallelized OpenAI Gym training show the promise of our RL-based approach. 1 Introduction Maintaining and monitoring soil health is a crucial challenge in the battle against climate change, particularly in the agricultural sector [ 1]. Soil degradation diminishes soil fertility and can lead to desertification, compelling farmers to resort to methods such as deforestation to meet growing food demand [ 2]. Furthermore, soil degradation and erosion lead to the release of sequestrated soil carbon stocks, which make up 2-3 times the carbon content of the atmospheric carbon pool [ 3]. Hence, even small changes in soil carbon stocks can have disastrous effects on the atmospheric CO2 concentration. Important challenges in the monitoring of soil health include determining soil carbon concentration, assessing soil fertility, and identifying heavy metal contaminants. These challenges are often considered separately, but they share a common goal: accurately determining the atomic abundance (i.e., atomic concentration) of key soil elements. Current soil testing techniques are able to identify these concentrations through combusting or reacting soil extracts and observing the reactions. However, these techniques have fundamental limitations that hinder their effectiveness for broader climate objectives. Firstly, due to the nature of these tests, they must occur in controlled laboratory settings, leading to costs (in USD) of $10-$50/sample for basic fertility and contaminant testing and up to $3000/sample for more comprehensive testing [4]. It has been estimated that to develop a reliable soil profile, soil testing should occur every few meters [ 5], meaning that this type of soil testing becomes prohibitively expensive even on the scale of a single farm. These scalability concerns hinder large-scale data collection efforts, which are important to identify and detect changes in atomic abundance. Being able to accurately detect these changes enables us to quantify the effects of different sustainable farming practices [ 6,7], as well as identify opportunities for their implementation. Furthermore, soil carbon quantification methods incur measurement errors when processing samples, [ 8], which undermine the reliability of soil carbon crediting programs, an integral part of the larger carbon market model for decarbonization. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.These limitations of current common soil testing techniques motivate the design of a reliable, scalable method for rapid atomic abundance measurement in soils. In this work, we use low-voltage NMR spectroscopy as a promising new approach for in-situ soil monitoring and present a novel reinforcement learning framework for modulating low-voltage NMR to perform rapid in-situ atomic abundance assessment. First, we present a fast, robust simulator for generating large quantities of NMR spectroscopy data able to simulate the spin dynamics of different soil samples in parallel. We then demonstrate how to utilize this simulator to train a reinforcement learning agent capable of modulating an NMR pulse sequence for the purpose of determining the carbon concentrations of various coffee samples, which we use as a soil simulant. 2 Background We start with some necessary background for NMR spectroscopy. Nuclear magnetic resonance is a physical phenomenon wherein the nuclear spins of atomic nuclei contained in a magnetic field are pulsed with electromagnetic radiation, causing the spins to precess before returning back in line with the magnetic field. This phenomenon is analogous to a spinning top being knocked over, precessing before eventually returning to rotation around the vertical axis. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy is a measurement technique based on this phenomenon, in which a substance is placed in a strong magnetic field and is exposed to a fixed sequence of radio-frequency pulses causing the atomic nuclei to emit energy at different frequencies according to their nuclear spin characteristics. The electromagnetic emission is measured at an axis perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic field, giving a signal known as the free induction decay (FID) [Figure 2a]. The Fourier transform of this signal is computed to obtain the NMR spectra [Figure 2b], and regression-based techniques are used to compare this spectra to previously sampled spectra for identification and analysis. NMR spectroscopy is most commonly used in medicine for a procedure known as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) to produce high quality images of human anatomy, but also has many prevalent applications in food science, environmental monitoring, and various engineering fields [9,10,11,12]. A current area of emerging NMR research is centered around developing and applying low-voltage NMR systems. These systems are of interest for soil monitoring because of their relative low-cost, as well as their ability to determine atomic abundance in situ. This is a crucial extension to traditional measurement techniques for atomic abundance, since it addresses many of the scalability concerns mentioned above. 3 Methods In this work, we aim to perform atomic abundance assessment using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy as a candidate procedure. As noted earlier, this assessment is useful for measuring soil carbon, fertility assessment, and heavy metal contaminant identification\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
