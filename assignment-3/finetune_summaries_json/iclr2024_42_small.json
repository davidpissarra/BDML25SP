We open- sourced the ExioML data and development toolkit to lower barriers and accel- erate the cooperation between Machine Learning and Ecological Economic re- search. A crucial greenhouse gas emission regression task evaluates the usabil- ity of the proposed dataset. We compared the performance of traditional shal- low models against deep models by leveraging a diverse factor accounting table and incorporating multiple modalities of categorical and numerical features. Our findings reveal that deep and ensemble models achieve low mean square errors below 0.25 and serve as a future machine learning research baseline. Through Ex- ioML, we aim to foster precise ML predictions and modelling to support climate actions and sustainable investment decisions.

This concern led to establishing the Paris Agreement in 2015, aiming to limit long-term temperature rise to no more than 2◦C above pre-industrial levels (Schleussner et al., 2016). Concurrently, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) were pro- posed to emphasize poverty eradication within the framework of emission reductions (Bruckner et al., 2022; Hubacek et al., 2017). To address the climate-trade dilemma, researchers from various disciplines strive to balance climate action with economic growth and human well-being (Rao et al., 2014; Jorgenson, 2014). Recently, the Machine Learning (ML) technique (LeCun et al., 2015) has emerged as a significant tool for accurate prediction to assist climate change decision-making (Rol- nick et al., 2022). Specifically, ML algorithms have been explored in aiding nearly real-time global weather forecasting (Lam et al., 2023), land monitoring via satellite imagery (Stanimirova et al., 2023; He et al., 2016), and the prediction of disturbances in electric grids (Zheng et al., 2022). The predominant Ecological Economic (EE) research framework, the Environmentally Extended Multiregional Input-Output (EE-MRIO) analysis, effectively models global economic interactions of sectors within a network structure (Leontief & Strout, 1963; Wang et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2020a; Steinberger et al., 2012; Jakob & Marschinski, 2013). However, a research gap exists between Ecological Economic and Machine Learning (EE-ML) cooperation, which can be summarised in three ways. The inaccessibility of the EE-MRIO dataset, the intensive data preprocessing required domain knowledge and the lack of Benchmark ML datasets and models. We proposed ExioM as the first ML-ready benchmark data in EE research to fill these gaps. The ExioML is developed on top of the high-quality open-source EE-MRIO dataset ExioBase 3.8.2 with high spatiotemporal resolution, enabling tracking resource flow between international sectors for global sectoral sustainability assessment. The ExioML developing toolkit is open-sourced, provides EE-MRIO calculation tools with GPU acceleration, and contributes to the high flexibility of cus- tomising interested factors, which reduces the barrier for ML researchers. The usability of the Ex- 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2024 ioML dataset was validated using multimodality regression to quantify the sectoral GHG emission, and a low MSE result was achieved. This establishes a critical baseline for accuracy and efficiency in future ML research. 2 L ITERATURE REVIEW EE-MRIO describes the environmental footprint for global economic activities and has become the fundamental framework for EE research, supporting various studies such as Structure Decomposi- tion Analysis (SDA) and Index Decomposition Analysis (IDA) to identify changes by decomposing key drivers (Hoekstra & Van den Bergh, 2003; Peters et al., 2017; Duan & Yan, 2019). Monitor em- bodied emissions with resource transfer and sustainability evaluation of supply chain in global trade (Meng et al., 2023; Tian et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2020; He & Hertwich, 2019; Li et al., 2020; Long et al., 2018; Sun et al., 2020a). ML algorithms have been applied with EE-MRIO for several applica- tions, such as accurately identifying ecological hotspots and inefficiencies within the global supply chain to optimise logistic paths to decrease carbon emissions while considering cost-effectiveness (Akbari & Do, 2021).
