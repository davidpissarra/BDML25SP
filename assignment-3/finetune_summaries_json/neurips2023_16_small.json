By strengthening local capacity within government agencies to leverage AI and Earth Observation-based solutions, this work seeks to improve the climate resilience of the housing sector in small island developing states in the Caribbean. 1 Introduction The Caribbean is among the world’s most climate-vulnerable regions due to the prevalence and intensity of extreme climate hazards such as storms, floods, and landslides. Category 5 hurricanes like Dorian, Irma, and Maria have devastated many small island developing states (SIDS) in recent years, leaving widespread trails of loss and destruction across the region. SIDS bear substantial economic costs from climate-extreme events, with the highest degree of damages often sustained in the housing sector [ 19]. Hurricane Maria, for example, destroyed over 90% of Dominica’s housing stock, accumulating costs over 200% of the nation’s GDP [ 18]. As global temperatures continue to rise, extreme weather events will only grow in severity, putting many more vulnerable homes and shelters at risk. In response to these challenges, governments and international organizations have developed am- bitious climate resilience programs to reduce the adverse effects of extreme climatic hazards in the housing sector [ 19,9]. Climate resilience initiatives generally require comprehensive housing stock information to inform better retrofitting, reconstruction, and relocation plans. However, the traditional house-to-house approach to identifying high-risk buildings can be extremely expensive and time-consuming to implement, prompting the need for more timely and cost-efficient alternatives. Recent years have seen a growing interest in using drones for disaster risk reduction and recovery [9,28]. Previous works have successfully applied deep learning (DL) techniques to very high- resolution (VHR) aerial imagery to extract baseline housing information such as building footprints and rooftop attributes [ 27,10,22,14,24]. However, despite the evident advantages DL and Earth observation (EO)-based technologies, the widespread adoption of these solutions is often hindered by gaps in local capacity to develop and maintain systems for generating baseline exposure datasets. This work aims to bridge these gaps by providing government agencies with an end-to-end workflow for rapidly generating critical baseline housing information using VHR drone images. Specifically, we leverage the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for building footprint delineation and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for roof type and roof material classification.

This work is developed under the Digital Earth Project for Resilient Housing and Infrastructure in partnership with the Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica (GoCD) and the Government of Saint Lucia (GoSL) to enhance the climate resilience of the housing sector of SIDS in the Caribbean. 2 Data To generate our ground truth datasets, we use (1) VHR aerial images in the form of aircraft- and drone-derived optical imagery and (2) building footprints in vector polygons, with Dominica and Saint Lucia as our primary regions of interest. VHR Aerial Images. We acquired the following VHR aerial images from partner government agencies GoCD and GoSL, the World Bank Global Program for Resilient Housing (GPRH) [ 8], and the open data platform OpenAerialMap [ 5]: (1) aircraft-derived post-disaster orthophotos of Dominica; (2) aircraft-derived orthophotos of Saint Lucia; (3) pre- and post-disaster drone images of 10 villages and cities across Dominica; (4) drone images of 3 districts in Saint Lucia. The spatial resolutions of aircraft-derived images range from 10 to 20 cm/px, whereas the resolutions of drone- derived images range from 2 to 5 cm/px. For more information on the spatial resolution, coverage, and year of acquisition of the aerial images, see Table 3 in the Appendix. Building Footprints Data. We obtained nationwide building footprints delineated from the aircraft- derived orthophotos of Dominica and Saint Lucia from the World Bank. For drone images with no corresponding building footprints, we initially looked to alternative data sources such as Open- StreetMap [ 6], Microsoft [ 4], and Google [ 2]. However, we found these publicly available building footprint datasets to be nonviable due to significant misalignment with the underlying drone images, as illustrated in Figure 2. To address this challenge, we used the Segment Anything\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
