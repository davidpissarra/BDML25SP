The Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) and Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) [ 8] exhibited a multitude of potential climate change mitigation pathways in line with climate targets. Though pathways vary, all scenarios are predicated on low- carbon energy sources supplying the majority of global energy consumption. Deep decarbonization, however, has yet to be realized as fossil fuel growth persists, thus prolonging an energy transition. Carney [ 3] urges the need for massive reallocation of capital toward low-carbon solutions and McCollum [ 9] quantiﬁes the investment gaps needed to be ﬁlled to achieve Paris. As individual countries act to answer these calls and deliver a collective transition to a low-carbon economy, risks will arise and companies may need to rapidly adapt. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures [ 15] highlighted such transition risks and their potential ﬁnancial impacts. Evidently, the risks inherent to a low-carbon energy transition pose an existential threat to the fossil fuel industry. Since the 2014 oil price collapse, international oil companies (IOCs) have signiﬁcantly underper- formed in contrast to economic growth realized in the same period, one of the many signs suggesting a faltering business model [ 14,17]. A crucial ﬁnancial recovery for IOCs becomes increasingly unlikely as the impending energy transition unfolds. Though posing an existential threat to the industry, the energy transition gives rise to signiﬁcant opportunities for such actors, particularly the oil and gas \u0003Corresponding Author: Dylan Radovic, dylan.radovic19@imperial.ac.uk 1The oil and gas Majors comprise of the seven largest publicly-traded international oil companies by market capitalization: ExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Shell, BP, Total, and Eni Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Majors. The Majors are the most susceptible to energy transition risks due to their dependence on high-cost reserves vulnerable to asset stranding and shareholder capital at risk of divestment [ 4,5] yet offer the balance-sheets and project management expertise necessary to ﬁnance and scale low-carbon technologies that could largely ﬁll the Paris-aligned investment gaps [ 7]. Central to this argument is the question of when will the Majors begin to transition towards low-carbon business models. Despite clear signals, the Majors have yet to make any signiﬁcant moves into low-carbon business models which would prove resilient to carbon demand shocks and, thus, produce stable returns, drawing concerns from investors and governments alike [6]. Literature regarding oil and gas companies in the energy transition echo the same sentiments: Majors can and should adapt to a low-carbon world. However, besides outlining potential low-carbon strategies, literature fails to provide tangible ﬁrst low-carbon mover risks and rewards. Quantifying such outcomes may suggest an end to the Majors’ capital reallocation waiting game by reducing diversiﬁcation uncertainties. Founded on the shareholder primacy model of capitalism, the Majors operate to maximize growth and returns to shareholders. This work aims to provide tangible insights into the Majors’ adaptive capacity to the energy transition by identifying ﬁrst low-carbon mover potential outcomes in relation to such metrics and, thus, strategy pathways robust to transition uncertainty. In efforts to achieve this, this work presents a novel deep MARL model utilized to solve a continuous microeconomics wargame. 2 Solving a Wargame The Oxford Sustainable Finance Programme and E3G developed the 2DP wargaming tool to “help inform company, investor, government and civil society thinking around the pathways the oil and gas majors can take to become 1.5\u000eC/2\u000eC-compatible” by simulating oil Majors in competition within varying transition scenarios [ 2]. 2DP wargame participants role play as IOCs tasked to responsibly allocate capital across oil, gas, and ‘green’ markets in efforts to minimize asset stranding while maximizing long-term market capitalization.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nRecent advances in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) have achieved superhuman-level performance in solving high-dimensional continuous control problems. We present a novel 2DP-MARL model that applies deep MARL methods to solve the 2DP wargame across various transition scenarios. The model is designed to mimic the behavior of oil Majors in real-life competition, revealing their ability to adapt to low-carbon business models and remain robust in the face of energy transition uncertainty.\n\nThe purpose of this work is to provide tangible metrics to support the call for oil Majors to diversify into low-carbon business models and accelerate the energy transition. An energy transition is underway to combat climate change and meet the goals set by the Paris Agreement. The Integrated Assessment Modeling Consortium (IAMC) and Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) have identified multiple climate change mitigation pathways that align with climate targets. However, deep decarbonization has yet to be achieved, as fossil fuel growth persists, prolonging the energy transition.\n\nThe need for massive reallocation of capital towards low-carbon solutions is urgent, as emphasized by Carney. McCollum quantifies the investment gaps needed to achieve Paris Agreement goals. As countries transition to a low-carbon economy, risks will arise, and companies must adapt quickly. The Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures highlighted transition risks and their potential financial impacts. The risks associated with a low-carbon energy transition pose an existential threat to the fossil fuel industry.\n\nSince the 2014 oil price collapse, international oil companies (IOCs) have underperformed compared to economic growth, indicating a faltering business model. A crucial financial recovery for IOCs becomes increasingly unlikely as the energy transition unfolds. The energy transition poses an existential threat to the industry but also creates significant opportunities for oil and gas companies, particularly the oil and gas Majors.\n\nThe Majors are the most susceptible to energy transition risks due to their dependence on high-cost reserves vulnerable to asset stranding and shareholder capital at risk of divestment.

This has raised concerns from investors and governments. Literature on oil and gas companies in the energy transition emphasizes that Majors can and should adapt to a low-carbon world.

The 2DP wargame simulates oil Majors in competition within varying transition scenarios, where participants role-play as IOCs tasked with responsibly allocating capital across oil, gas, and 'green' markets to minimize asset stranding while maximizing long-term market capitalization."
