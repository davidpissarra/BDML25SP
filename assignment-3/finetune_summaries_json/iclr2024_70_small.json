However, hydropower plants are currently perceived both posi- tively as sources of renewable energy and negatively as disruptors of ecosystems. In this work, we highlight the overlooked potential of using hydropower plant as protectors of ecosystems by using adaptive ecological discharges. To advocate for this perspective, we propose using a neural network to predict the minimum ecological discharge value at each desired time. Additionally, we present a novel framework that seamlessly integrates it into hydropower management software, taking advantage of the well-established approach of using traditional constrained optimisation algorithms. This novel approach not only protects the ecosystems from climate change but also contributes to potentially increase the electricity production. 1 I NTRODUCTION The link between fossil fuel-based energy production and global warming has spurred intensive exploration into alternative, cleaner energy sources. Hydropower plants play a pivotal role in ad- vancing clean and sustainable energy production, contributing significantly to the global transition towards renewable energy sources. By harnessing the kinetic energy of flowing water, hydropower offers a reliable and consistent electricity source devoid of greenhouse gas emissions or other pol- lutants. Its renewable nature, combined with the capacity for large-scale power generation, makes hydropower an important clean energy production strategy. Furthermore, hydropower plants play a critical role in addressing the intermittent nature of other renewable sources such as solar and wind, improving the stability of the grid, and providing energy storage through reservoirs (Chala et al., 2019). Compared to fossil fuel alternatives, hydropower has a relatively low environmental foot- print, contributing to a decrease in air pollution and efforts to combat climate change. As nations strive to achieve ambitious carbon reduction targets, hydropower stands out as a versatile and envi- ronmentally friendly solution, playing a crucial role in building a sustainable energy future (Berga, 2016). However, the construction of hydropower plants within ecosystems demands meticulous consideration of normal flow dynamics to mitigate potential environmental impacts. The ecosystem of a river is a complex web of interconnected relationships between various organisms, water quality parameters, and physical features. The normal flow of a river plays a crucial role in the maintenance of biodiversity and the support of aquatic habitats. When planning and implementing a hydropower project, it is imperative to maintain normal flow patterns to minimise disruptions to the ecosystem. Alteration of flow can affect fish migration, sediment transport, and nutrient distribution, potentially leading to habitat degradation and loss of biodiversity (Kuriqi et al., 2021). By preserving normal flow, run-of-river hydropower projects can strike a balance between clean energy generation and environmental sustainability, thus promoting the coexistence of renewable energy development and ecosystem health. 1Submitted to the ICLR 2024 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning To mitigate the impact to the ecosystem of hydropower plants, governments mandate minimum discharges, designated by ecological discharges, to promote normal river flow. The fixed levels of ecological discharges for maintaining normal river flow are typically established through a combina- tion of scientific research, environmental impact assessments, and regulatory frameworks. Although these levels are intended to protect against detrimental ecological impacts, one challenge is that they may not readily adapt to climate change dynamics. Climate change can lead to alterations in precipitation patterns, temperature regimes, and hydrological cycles, potentially affecting river ecosystems. As climate-related shifts occur, the fixed discharge levels may become less representa- tive of the evolving environmental conditions (Ren ¨of¨alt et al., 2010). This highlights the need for a dynamic and adaptive regulatory approach that can accommodate the uncertainties associated with climate change, ensuring that environmental discharge standards remain effective in preserving river ecosystems amidst a changing climate. Non-compliance with environmental regulations can result in fines imposed on hydropower man- agement companies. Consequently, and due to the difficulty of the problem, these companies turn to software tools to optimise water management, enabling them to make optimal decisions over various time periods. This management problem can be formulated as a constrained optimisation problem, with ecological discharges being one of the many constraints to be satisfied (Grygier & Stedinger, 1985; Helseth et al., 2020). Due to the absence of monetary incentives for allocating water beyond minimum discharges, com- panies and their management software ultimately strictly adhere to allocating the mandate amount of water. However, the static nature of the imposed ecological discharges may be ill-suited to the dynamic needs of ecosystems, aggravated by factors such as climate change. Guidelines may not be adjusted to accommodate these changing needs, leading to a potential insufficiency of water to promote the well-being of habitats caused by periods of drought or when atmospheric conditions are more favourable to water evaporation. Conversely, it may promote unnecessary discharges, espe-\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
