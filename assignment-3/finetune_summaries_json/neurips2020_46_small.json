Hence, knowing the location, size, and orientation of existing PV systems is essential to predict PV electricity supply and to support the planning and operation of electricity systems. However, keeping track of installed PV systems is difﬁcult due to their decentralized character and large number. Centralized PV registries are intended to keep track of PV system installations but have considerable shortcomings. One approach to collect PV system data are self-reports, such as the Open PV project [ 10] or Germany’s ofﬁcial PV registry [ 2], where owners are required to register their PV system. Efforts for generating and maintaining these registries, however, are high and human data entry is often error-prone. Furthermore, PV systems are mostly registered using street addresses so that important information on the exact location of the systems, such as corresponding rooftops, remain unknown. To address these shortcomings, a second type of registries has recently emerged, which recollects PV system data in an automated fashion using aerial imagery and machine learning [12,17,4,13]. An overview is provided in [ 6]. Yet, these approaches do not link detected PV systems to their respective buildings. Hence, important information for power systems operation, such as tilt angle, orientation angle, occupied rooftop area, as well as socio-economic information associated with buildings and their owners remains unknown. In this work, we ﬁrst propose an automated approach to generate an enriched PV registry with additional information such as tilt angle, orientation, and general building data. For this purpose, we combine aerial imagery with 3D building geometries. This enriched registry provides the basis for several important applications, such as supply predictions, PV nowcasting, and estimation of available rooftop capacities [ 6]. As a second contribution, we demonstrate how the tilt angle derived from *Equal contribution.

As a third contribution, we compare our constructed registry to the German PV registry [ 2]—an ofﬁcial registry relying on self-reported data. This has previously not been done [ 6]. We thereby identify non-reported installations, erroneous locations, and duplicated entries. This shows that automated PV registries, such as our approach, may be valuable for policy makers for improving ofﬁcial PV registries relying on self-reported data. 2 Methodology In Figure 1, we describe how aerial imagery and 3D building data are combined in order to create the enriched PV registry with an automated processing pipeline.
