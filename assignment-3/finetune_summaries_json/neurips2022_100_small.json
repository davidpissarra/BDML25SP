Cargo-bike logistics has been put forward as a high impact candidate for replacing LGVs, with experts estimating over half of urban van deliveries being replaceable by cargo bikes, due to their faster speeds, shorter parking times and more efficient routes across cities. By modelling the relative delivery performance of different vehicle types across urban micro-regions, machine learning can help operators evaluate the business and environmental impact of adding cargo-bikes to their fleets. In this paper, we introduce two datasets, and present initial progress in modelling urban delivery service time (e.g. cruising for parking, unloading, walking). Using Uber’s H3 index to divide the cities into hexagonal cells, and aggregating OpenStreetMap tags for each cell, we show that urban context is a critical predictor of delivery performance. 1 Introduction Today, transport accounts for around 30% of a city’s carbon emissions, and is expected to grow at a faster rate than any other sector in the coming decade [ 1]. One of the drivers behind this acceleration is the increasing demand for faster logistics due to the boom of the e-commerce industry. By 2025, the number of packages delivered around the world is expected to climb to 200 billion, up from fewer than 90 billion in 2018 [ 2]. Given the current trends, it is estimated that both the amount of CO2 emissions and traffic congestion caused by urban last-mile deliveries will increase by 30% by 2030 (6 million tonnes CO2 compared to 2019) [3]. The single most challenging aspect for logistics operators in meeting this exceptional rise in demand comes down to the last mile of the delivery (with some reporting it accounts for more than 50% of their total delivery cost). Recently, cargo bike logistics has been put forward as a competitive, ultra-low emission, and environmentally sustainable candidate for replacing vans-only logistics fleets in cities. Scientific reports and pilot studies have been confirming the potential of cargo bike logistics 0These authors contributed equally to this work ∗Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Alabama, Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA †Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT Kharagpur, Kharagpur, West Bengal 721302, India ‡Kale Collective, London, UK §MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, Cambridge, MA, USA ¶University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK ∥Data-intensive Systems and Applications, IT University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.and their superior efficiency in dense urban areas [ 4,5,6]. As an example, a recent study found that 67% of daily van operations of a large logistics operator in Paris could be substituted by cargo-bikes at no extra cost [7]. The importance of data-driven decision-making is paramount in an industry known for high pressure and tight margins. However, data collection processes vary widely in maturity. Incumbent companies struggle from data quality issues across the logistics chain, which hampers their data science efforts, and little data around cargo-bike logistics exists. Current tools used by operators fall short of capturing the complexity of driver behaviour, even less the varying vehicle efficiency in the real world. Experienced delivery drivers have tacit knowledge that help them efficiently navigate highly complex urban environments to serve customers. The theoretical routes generated by optimisation engines still diverge considerably from the complexities of the real wold; they fail to take into account factors such as time spent by delivery drivers searching for parking, or the time spent walking between the vehicle and multiple delivery locations [ 8], that both have significant impact on the delivery time and depend heavily on the type of vehicle used. As such, predicting the duration of delivery runs as well as estimating delivery times remains a considerable challenge for operators [9]. 2 Modelling delivery performance of vehicles across urban micro-regions Modelling the performance of delivery vehicles (here, vans and cargo-bikes) will help towards accurately representing their relative efficiency across different urban contexts. Operators are faced with complex trade-offs that need to consider to the quantity and size of deliveries, their density patterns across different urban areas, and the capacity and efficiency of vehicles in their fleets. We present initial results on predicting service time, which includes time searching for parking, unloading parcels, and walking to destinations. The importance of service time for delivery performance. A 2018 study in London highlighted that walking can account for 62% of the total van round time [ 10] due to limited suitable kerbside parking space in urban centres. Similarly, studies found that delivery drivers spend on average 5.8 minutes and 24 minutes searching for each parking spot in Seattle and New York City, respectively [ 11,12]. Despite the significant amount of time currently spent looking for parking, optimisation tools largely ignore the search time for parking in route planning [ 13]. Choosing when and where to park remains a decision made by the driver [ 8], which can have significant impact\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
