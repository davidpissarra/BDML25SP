The dataset con- sists of globally available meteorological features widely used for drought prediction, paired with location meta-data which has not previously been utilised for drought forecasting. Here we also establish a baseline on DroughtED and present the ﬁrst research to apply deep learning models - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) and Trans- formers - to predict county-level drought condi- tions across the full extent of the United States. Our results indicate that DroughtED enables deep learning models to learn cross-region patterns in climate data that contribute to drought condi- tions and models trained on DroughtED compare favourably to state-of-the-art drought prediction models trained on individual regions. 1. Introduction Droughts are natural events characterized by prolonged shortages of precipitation. Unforeseen droughts cause pro- found economic and social impacts, resulting in signiﬁcant losses to agriculture, domestic water supply and natural wildlife (Svoboda et al., 2002). Since 1980, the United States (US) has experienced 26 major unexpected droughts, 1School of Informatics, The University of Edinburgh, Ed- inburgh, Scotland.

Under the current trajectory of global warming, the US is anticipated to experience chronic drought conditions with increased frequency and intensity over the coming decades (Elsner et al., 2010; Hayhoe et al., 2018). Effective monitoring and prediction models are there- fore critical for informing drought management action and can help mitigate the detrimental economic impacts on indi- viduals, communities and nature. To the best of our knowledge, deep learning has never been applied to the task of nationwide drought forecasting. Pre- vious attempts to predict future drought conditions using deep learning have focused on small homogeneous areas within a distinct geographic location (Agana & Homaifar, 2017; Dikshit et al., 2021; Mishra et al., 2007). Whilst this showcases the promising opportunity to apply deep learning for drought forecasting, these regional models and datasets remain restricted to an isolated area, thereby lim- iting the ability for environmental stakeholders to monitor drought conditions at larger scales. Regional models overﬁt to state-level observations in climate datasets and, by their construction, have no opportunity to learn meteorological patterns that are consistent across multiple heterogeneous re- gions. Furthermore, regional models have inherently siloed applications, therefore increasing the technical overhead for environmental organisations to transfer these models to new geographic areas. The input features presented in this paper enable the pre- diction of national drought conditions using a single deep learning model. Forecasting drought across heterogeneous regions using exclusively meteorological observations is a challenging task. The distribution of climate patterns that contribute to drought are dependent on their geographic climate. For instance, in the US, states with vast regions of desert such as Nevada and semi-arid mountainous states such as Wyoming, both experience low-levels of annual rain- fall, however, they do not share similar drought conditions (Easterling et al., 2017). Given this complexity, previous attempts to forecast drought in the US have focused ex- clusively on regional models, such as predicting drought conditions in Western US States or in the Colorado River Basin (Agana & Homaifar, 2017; Bolen et al., 2021).DroughtED: A dataset and methodology for drought forecasting To address these key issues with regional models, this paper contributes a new dataset for the task of large-scale drought forecasting, named DroughtED (Drought Earth Dataset). The dataset combines globally consistent spatial and tempo- ral features related to drought that enable machine learning models to be trained for nationwide drought prediction and monitoring. Also, we include a location-identiﬁer feature in the DroughtED dataset which, when used as an input feature to a deep learning model, enables drought predictions across diverse geographic regions. As a secondary contribution, we establish a baseline on DroughtED and present the ﬁrst evaluation of two deep learning models - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) and Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) models - for the task of drought forecasting across the US. Altogether, we hope that this work will facilitate future deep learning research in tackling the complex challenge of large-scale drought fore- casting and will reduce the barrier to entry for new regions to employ machine learning systems for improved drought monitoring. 2.
