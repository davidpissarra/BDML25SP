Introduction Global installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) generation continues to accelerate, and solar PV is now the fastest growing form of electricity generation worldwide [ 5]. How- ever, while this increasing uptake of solar is a welcome development, high levels of solar PV can lead to complex issues for our existing electrical grids. An early example for this is the state of Western Australia, which has one of the highest rates of solar uptake in the world, with some neighbourhoods having solar on more than 50% of homes [ 1]. The national energy market opera- tor recently reported extensively on the issues that all this distributed rooftop solar PV is starting to cause [17]: Grid instability : many distribution feeders are now feeding back into the grid for extended periods of the day, leading to problems with voltage control and frequency stability. System volatility : when cloud bands pass over neighbour- hoods having high levels of solar PV, there can be signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in generation that must be handled by short-term reserves and ancillary services. New contingency risks : during disturbances, inverters may trip for short periods, which at scale can be equivalent to a 1Department of Mechanical Engineering, School of Electri- cal, Mechanical and Infrastructure Engineering, The University of Melbourne2School of Computing and Information Systems, Melbourne Centre for Data Science, The University of Melbourne.major generator temporarily going ofﬂine. System restart : after blackouts, a certain level of load is required to re-energise the system, and this can be difﬁcult to achieve when many neighbourhoods are in fact behaving like generators. Market volatility : high levels of distributed solar PV (which affect net demand) can be difﬁcult for market opera- tors to forecast, and have made markets more volatile. The above list is not exhaustive and many other issues exist [3,9,10]. These issues are already starting to have a major impact on system and market operation in Australia and other markets where uptake is high. Given the rates of uptake across many other geographies, it is likely that these problems will start to emerge in many parts of the world in the coming 5-10 years. If they are not addressed, there is a risk that uptake of solar PV will be slowed, generation levels of existing systems may be curtailed, and the full potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions may not be realised. Fortunately, many of these issues can be addressed by emerg- ing technologies and tools, such as energy storage and im- proved solar PV estimation and forecasting. There has been extensive work on forecasting solar output of individual sys- tems, and forecasting approaches can range from numerical weather prediction [ 8], to on-site sky imaging systems [ 7], to the use of satellite imagery [ 6,13], to standard statistical forecasting tools [ 14], to (more recently) the use of machine learning to develop probabilistic forecasts [19]. However, what is urgently required now is a better ability to forecast distributed solar PV generation for entire regions, such as a whole distribution feeder, or an entire market zone. To date this has been difﬁcult to do: there is no region in the world that has direct access to metering and sensing of all distributed solar PV systems; in many locations, the actual number and generating capacities of all systems may not even be known; and there is no ground truth against which competing approaches may be evaluated. However, an ability to estimate and forecast solar PV generation across entire regions is becoming increasingly essential, since this would allow system operators to better handle and plan for many of the previously mentioned issues that distributed solar PV is starting to introduce. In this paper we present a proposal for a new approach to estimation and forecasting of solar PV generation across entire regions.
