These methods are primarily categorized into supervised techniques, which yield precise results but come with high labeling costs, and unsupervised techniques, which eliminate the need for labeling but involve intricate hyperpa- rameter tuning. To address these challenges, we propose a novel unsupervised change detection method named Prototype-oriented Unsupervised Change Detec- tion for Disaster Management (PUCD). PUCD captures changes by comparing features from pre-event, post-event, and prototype-oriented change synthesis im- ages via a foundational model, and refines results using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Although PUCD is an unsupervised change detection, it does not require complex hyperparameter tuning. We evaluate PUCD framework on the LEVIR-Extension dataset and the disaster dataset and it achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to other methods on the LEVIR-Extension dataset. 1 Introduction Climate change is leading to more extreme weather events [ 23]. With the acceleration of global warming, damage from climate-related disasters such as floods and tropical cyclones is escalating [ 2, 19]. As a result, there is heightened emphasis on the critical role of disaster management in both prevention and response [ 28]. Employing remote sensing data for disaster management proves efficient as it enables the monitoring of large areas [ 11,34]. However, even though remote sensing is efficient, the large area affected by natural disasters makes it difficult for humans to analyze [ 18]. Addressing these challenges, unsupervised change detection (UCD) methods have been introduced, utilizing change vector analysis (CV A) of pre- and post-disaster images [ 20,5,22,25,32,6]. While UCD allows for rapid responses, it necessitates the adjustment of numerous hyperparameters. This is because UCD uses pixel statistical differences such as brightness, color, and clarity of the image, so it is difficult to generalize differences across various disaster types and regions. On the other hand, supervised change detection [ 12,1,35,26] can be used without the need to adjust hyperparameters. However, it is difficult to build large-scale datasets because disaster situations are rare [ 13]. Specifying and labeling targets of interest also requires a significant cost [ 33]. In addition, these models cannot respond to disasters that are not trained. In this paper, we introduce a Prototype-oriented Unsupervised Change Detection for Disaster Management (PUCD), illustrated as Figure 1. This approach designates a target-of-interest as a prototype and detects changes relative to it. PUCD uses the DINOv2 foundational model to extract features representing the context and structure of pre-, post-event imageries and prototypes. Following this, CV A is applied to the features of the pre-, post-event images and the prototype to identify changed Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Overview of our PUCD framework.

The preliminary coarse output is then enhanced using the segment anything technique [16]. To evaluate the PUCD framework, we conducted qualitative assessments on events like the Libyan flood, the United States hurricane, and the Japan tsunami. Subsequent quantitative evaluations were executed using the LEVIR-Extension dataset. Our experimental results showed that PUCD is qualitatively and quantitatively efficient. 2 Method In this section, we provide a detailed explanation of the PUCD framework. Initially, we summarize the components constituting PUCD, specifically the DINOv2 and the segment anything model. Subsequently, we delve into the contents corresponding to Figure 1-(a), (b), (c), and (d) in sequence. 2.1 Preliminaries DINOv2 DINOv2 [ 24] is a foundational model rooted in representation learning, widely used in various computer vision tasks. It utilizes the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture [ 10,14] and is trained on a comprehensive compilation of diverse datasets [ 24]. DINOv2 is trained using contrastive learning, assessing the similarity between objects in two images based on their context and shape [4,24]. Consequently, DINOv2 is not only capable of capturing changes in context and shape but also exhibits robustness to stylistic change. This capability underpins our rationale for employing DINOv2, particularly for UCD tasks that necessitate detecting changes in context and shape.
