Achieving long-term cooperation on climate change mitigation with nstrategic agents poses a complex game-theoretic problem. For example, agents may negotiate and reach climate agreements, but there is no central authority to enforce adherence to those agreements. Hence, it is critical to design negotiation and agreement frameworks that foster cooperation, allow all agents to meet their individual policy objectives, and incentivize long-term adherence. This is an interdisciplinary challenge that calls for collaboration between researchers in machine learning, economics, climate science, law, policy, ethics, and other fields. In particular, we argue that machine learning is a critical tool to address the complexity of this domain. To facilitate this research, here we introduce RICE-N, a multi-region integrated assessment model that sim- ulates the global climate and economy, and which can be used to design and evaluate the strategic outcomes for differ- ent negotiation and agreement frameworks. We also describe how to use multi-agent reinforcement learning to train ratio- nal agents using RICE-N. This framework underpins AI for Global Climate Cooperation, a working group collaboration and competition on climate negotiation and agreement design. Here, we invite the scientific community to design and evalu- ate their solutions using RICE-N, machine learning, economic intuition, and other domain knowledge.

Ecosys- tems are drastically changing: the Amazon rainforest is re- ceding (Lovejoy and Nobre 2018) and polar ice sheets are melting (Boers and Rypdal 2021; DeConto et al. 2021). Ex- treme weather events are clear warning signs too, such as the recent uptick in coastal flooding and forest fires. These developments are increasingly being attributed to climate change and driving towards a system-wide tipping point. *Work done while at Salesforce.Climate change is a global phenomenon, and it affects all. In response, private and public financing have driven techno- logical innovation (e.g., in renewable energy) and commu- nity campaigns to drive systemic change. However, climate change mitigation investments vary in size and type across nations and global regions, due to various social and eco- nomic factors. For example, developing nations may need to focus first on the basic needs of their citizens, while devel- oped nations have more funding and opportunities to prepare for the adverse impacts of climate change. Hence, climate change presents a classic case of “tragedy of the commons”, where individual agents who pursue their own self-interest may lead to a destructive outcome for everyone. As such, achieving and maintaining global cooperation is essential to achieve the Paris Agreement’s long-term goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2◦Cabove pre-industrial levels (DeConto et al. 2021). At the same time, it is important to maintain economic development, e.g., achieving growth and reducing inequality. For example, in- ternational trade treaties, foreign investment, and technol- ogy transfer may enable developing countries to meet net- zero commitments, while contributing to global economic growth. Such cooperation may be implemented through cli- mate clubs (Nordhaus 2015), which may overcome barriers to taking action on climate change. From a modeling point of view, achieving and maintaining global cooperation poses a complex game-theoretic prob- lem involving cooperation, communication, and competition. This game can be modeled with nstrategic agents, each agent representing a region or nation. Each agent is (boundedly) rational and implements policies to achieve its own socio- economic and climate objectives, which may be at odds with the objectives of the other agents. Agents interact through trade, diplomacy, or foreign aid and investments. Cooperation may happen through mutual negotiation and agreements. However, a crucial issue is that there is no central entity For more information, see www.ai4climatecoop.org. E-mail: climate-cooperation-competition@googlegroups.com.

For these reasons, it is critical to design multilateral negotiations and agreements that best foster con- tinuing cooperation towards mitigating climate change while allowing all parties to meet their individual policy objectives. Such game-theoretic problems pose unsolved technical challenges.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe economic development of a region can lead to an increase in inequality, but it can also achieve long-term economic growth. Achieving long-term cooperation on climate change mitigation with multiple agents is a complex game-theoretic problem. For instance, agents may negotiate and reach climate agreements, but there is no central authority to enforce adherence to those agreements. Therefore, it is crucial to design negotiation and agreement frameworks that foster cooperation, allow all agents to meet their individual policy objectives, and incentivize long-term adherence. This is an interdisciplinary challenge that requires collaboration between researchers in machine learning, economics, climate science, law, policy, ethics, and other fields.\n\nWe argue that machine learning is a critical tool to address the complexity of this domain. To facilitate this research, we introduce RICE-N, a multi-region integrated assessment model that simulates the global climate and economy. This model can be used to design and evaluate the strategic outcomes for different negotiation and agreement frameworks. We also describe how to use multi-agent reinforcement learning to train rational agents using RICE-N. This framework underpins AI for Global Climate Cooperation, a working group collaboration and competition on climate negotiation and agreement design.\n\nWe invite the scientific community to design and evaluate their solutions using RICE-N, machine learning, economic intuition, and other domain knowledge. The latest IPCC report warns that it is \"now or never\" to stave off a climate disaster. Ecosystems are drastically changing, with the Amazon rainforest receding and polar ice sheets melting. Extreme weather events, such as coastal flooding and forest fires, are clear warning signs of climate change, driving the world towards a system-wide tipping point.\n\nClimate change is a global phenomenon that affects everyone. In response, private and public financing have driven technological innovation and community campaigns to drive systemic change. However, climate change mitigation investments vary in size and type across nations and global regions due to various social and economic factors. For example, developing nations may need to focus on the basic needs of their citizens, while developed nations have more funding and opportunities to prepare for the adverse impacts of climate change.\n\nAchieving and maintaining global cooperation is essential to achieve the Paris Agreement's long-term goal of limiting global temperature rise to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels.
