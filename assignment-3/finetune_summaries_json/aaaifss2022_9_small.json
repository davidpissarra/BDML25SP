The objective of this short paper is to explore the state of benchmark datasets for ML tasks related to natural disasters, categorizing them according to the disaster management cycle. We compile a list of existing benchmark datasets introduced in the past five years. We propose a web platform - NADBenchmarks - where researchers can search for benchmark datasets for natural dis- asters, and we develop a preliminary version of such a plat- form using our compiled list. This paper is intended to aid researchers in finding benchmark datasets to train their ML models on, and provide general directions for topics where they can contribute new benchmark datasets. 1 Introduction With climate change exacerbating the intensity, frequency, and duration of extreme weather events and natural disas- ters across the world (Portner et al. 2022), rapid advance- ment is required in its management. Researchers are taking advantage of the huge amount of data available, applying ML for more effective solutions in managing natural dis- asters (Dwarakanath et al. 2021; Yu, Yang, and Li 2018). For example, the NOAA website1contains carefully curated climate change related data that researchers can use. How- ever, progress is relatively slow. In fields of computer vi- sion and natural language processing, benchmark datasets have played a crucial role in their recent rapid advancement and we believe that developing ML algorithms for natural disaster management can benefit from such rigor. Bench- mark datasets are preprocessed, curated datasets for training and testing ML algorithms. These datasets provide scope for standard evaluation, allowing ML communities to quantify their progress and compare their models against each other. Existing review papers focus on the role of big data and machine learning to tackle natural disasters (Dwarakanath Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

The objective of this short paper is to explore the state of benchmark datasets for ML tasks related to natural disasters, categorizing the datasets according to the disaster manage- ment cycle, which consists of four stages - mitigation, pre- paredness, responses and recovery (Khan et al. 2008). The mitigation phase deals with making long term plans to re- duce the effects of a disaster; the preparedness phase fo- cuses on plans for responding to a disaster; response activi- ties include damage assessment and providing post-disaster coordination; and the recovery phase relates to recovering from the damages. For this task, we compile a list of ex- isting benchmark datasets introduced in the past five years, find current gaps in literature, and discuss their implications. To facilitate research in this domain, we propose a web plat- form - NADBenchmarks - where researchers can search for benchmark datasets related to the topic. Our goal is to in- crease accessibility for researchers, instead of generating a leaderboard platform since leaderboards often pose the risk of simplifying progress to a singular metric (Ethayarajh and Jurafsky 2020). Our preliminary version of such a platform developed using our compiled list can be found in this link2. 2 Method Search Criteria: We searched different combinations of the keywords ‘ML datasets’, ‘natural disaster’, and ‘benchmark’ in Google Scholar, ACM digital library and Scopus.

For this short review, we focused on papers from the past five years (2017-2022) since we wanted to capture the most recent works as a representation of the current state of the art for this domain.

To address this issue, researchers are leveraging the vast amount of available data to develop more effective solutions for natural disaster management using ML (Dwarakanath et al., 2021; Yu, Yang, and Li, 2018). For instance, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) website provides curated climate change-related data that researchers can utilize. However, progress in this area is relatively slow. In fields like computer vision and natural language processing, benchmark datasets have played a crucial role in their recent rapid advancement, and we believe that developing ML algorithms for natural disaster management can benefit from such rigor.\n\nBenchmark datasets are preprocessed, curated datasets for training and testing ML algorithms. These datasets provide a scope for standard evaluation, allowing ML communities to quantify their progress and compare their models against each other.
