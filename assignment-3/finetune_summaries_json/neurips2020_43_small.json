Using these datasets we create two challenges (1) general stream ﬂow forecasting and (2) ﬂash ﬂood damage estimation. We have created several publicly available benchmarks and an easy to use package. Additionally, in the future we aim to augment our dataset with snow pack data and soil index moisture data to improve predictions. 1 Introduction Flooding has signiﬁcant negative effects on infrastructure, agriculture, housing and the population as a whole. Approximately 41 million residents in the United States alone are at risk of stream and river ﬂooding.1Flooding related costs in the U.S. averaged 8 billion dollars per year between 2011-2018. Additionally, worldwide between 1980 and 2009 there were over 500,000 ﬂood related deaths. While directly linking increased ﬂooding to climate change is difﬁcult, recent research has indicated a statistically signiﬁcant increase in heavy precipitation events2. Moreover, researchers believe that this trend could continue well into the 21st century3. Therefore, it is important to develop accurate forecasts and response plans to help mitigate the damage. Although a number of studies have used machine learning to forecast river ﬂows they are usually focused on a single river basin Yaseen et al. [2019] or a single state Sit and Demir [2019]. A few studies have applied machine learning to predicting tornado damage Diaz and Joseph [2019]. But, we were unable to ﬁnd any previous research that forecasted ﬂood based property damage. The dataset by Addor and Clark [2017] remains a commonly used benchmark, however it only contains roughly 600 streams and data is only provided on the daily basis. Many ﬂash ﬂoods develop quite quickly in response to heavy precipitation events therefore a more granular dataset is needed to truly provide timely alerts. To rectify these problems we purpose a new large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of hourly USGS ﬂow data from rivers around the country combined with hourly precipitation and temperature data. Additionally, we utilize NLP to construct a second subset consisting of ﬂash ﬂood events. This dataset includes ﬂow data, precipitation data, property damage estimates, injury data, and regional information. 1https://www.nrdc.org/stories/ﬂooding-and-climate-change-everything-you-need-know 2https://www.ipcc.ch/site/assets/uploads/2018/03/SREX-Chap3_FINAL-1.pdf p.111 3ibid p.112 Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning at NeurIPS 2020 (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.2 Dataset Creation and Prediction Tasks To create a dataset we utilize publicly available stream ﬂow data from the United States Geological Service (USGS). We built a scraper to initially get data over a ﬁve year period from 2014-2019 for each USGS gage. For precipitation data we acquired data from USGS, SNOTEL, NOAA, ASOS, EcoNet, as well as other sources. In order to get the data together we normalized timestamps and then left-joined the stream ﬂow and the weather data together. We created code to compute the distance between every river gage and weather station. For missing values we use simple mean of the two closest known values on each side. We choose this method as rainfall amount is often directly related to its nearby values. We add a column which indicates whether the value was a result of imputation. Another source of noise in the dataset is the presence of dam fed/controlled rivers. While some dam controlled rivers are easy to identify (due to their cyclical release nature) others are much harder. However, for the time being we elect to keep all river/stream data in the dataset as it could be beneﬁcial to see if the model could accurately forecast release levels. To construct the ﬂash ﬂood dataset for the second task, we use NOAA’s NSSL Flash dataset4. Similar to the ﬂood forecast we tie the data to rainfall event using timestamps. We use Flair NER5to extract stream names from the narrative reports and when available attach the relevant USGS data. 3 Dataset statistics Task one includes combined river ﬂows, precipitation, and temperature data for more than 8000 gages, in all 50 U.S. states. In total this is over 70 million hours of river ﬂow data. For the second dataset we have a total of 4320 ﬂash ﬂood related events. There is a class imbalance in this dataset particularly with respect to injuries/fatalities with 4262 of the ﬂash ﬂood events resulting in none. With respect to property/crop damage, 2763 of the ﬂash ﬂood events resulted in no damage. While, only 156 events caused over a million dollars\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nFlooding has significant negative effects on infrastructure, agriculture, housing, and the population as a whole. Approximately 41 million residents in the United States are at risk of stream and river flooding. Flooding-related costs in the U.S. averaged $8 billion per year between 2011 and 2018. Worldwide, between 1980 and 2009, there were over 500,000 flood-related deaths. While directly linking increased flooding to climate change is difficult, recent research has indicated a statistically significant increase in heavy precipitation events. Researchers believe this trend could continue well into the 21st century. Therefore, it is essential to develop accurate forecasts and response plans to help mitigate the damage.\n\nAlthough several studies have used machine learning to forecast river flows, they are usually focused on a single river basin or a single state. A few studies have applied machine learning to predicting tornado damage, but we were unable to find any previous research that forecasted flood-based property damage. The dataset by Addor and Clark (2017) remains a commonly used benchmark, but it only contains roughly 600 streams and provides data on a daily basis. Many flash floods develop quickly in response to heavy precipitation events, making a more granular dataset necessary to provide timely alerts.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose a new large-scale benchmark dataset consisting of hourly USGS flow data from rivers across the country combined with hourly precipitation and temperature data. We also utilize natural language processing (NLP) to construct a second subset consisting of flash flood events. This dataset includes flow data, precipitation data, property damage estimates, injury data, and regional information.\n\nTo create the dataset, we utilize publicly available stream flow data from the United States Geological Service (USGS). We built a scraper to obtain data over a five-year period from 2014 to 2019 for each USGS gage. For precipitation data, we acquired data from various sources, including USGS, SNOTEL, NOAA, ASOS, and EcoNet. We normalized timestamps and left-joined the stream flow and weather data together. We created code to compute the distance between every river gage and weather station. For missing values, we used the simple mean of the two closest known values on each side. We added a column indicating whether the value was a result of imputation.\n\nAnother source of noise in the dataset is the presence of dam-fed/controlled rivers. While some dam-controlled rivers are easy to identify, others are more challenging. For the time being, we elected to keep all river/stream data in the dataset to see if the model could accurately forecast release levels.\n\nTo construct the flash flood dataset, we used NOAA's NSSL Flash dataset.
