With an uncertain future of nuclear power in Europe [1] and the US [2], it can be expected that a large portion of electricity generation will come from the other source of carbon-free electricity: renewable technologies including photovoltaics, on-shore and off-shore wind turbines and hydro-power. Together with a much larger temperature dependency of electricity demand, as the electrification of heating goes underway, the behaviour of these future power systems will be largely driven by weather [3]. 1.1 W EATHER IN POWER SYSTEMS PLANNING Traditionally, power system planning didn’t examine weather since the power generation was con- trollable and responded to demand. Later, the growing seasonal signal in load and other parts of the system, begun to be supplied through a representative year. This practice is still prevalent in power system engineering, as evidenced by the latest guidelines of the European transmission coordinator for their ten year development cycle, which considered 30 years of weather but ultimately only chose 3 specific years (1995, 2008 and 2009) to act as the climate representative years [4, p. 15]. Studies focusing on renewable generation usually consider several years of historical data, often taken from reanalyses [5, 6], which assimilate observed data onto easy-to-use grids. It’s crucial to recognize that, as we’re designing and planning weather-dependent systems for the next 5-20 years, we simply don’t know what the weather will be. We have to treat future weather as a probability distribution of possible scenarios, in which our power system still needs to function. As shown above, this distribution is often implicitly constructed directly from the existing weather record. When considering a small scale study (such as a single wind turbine), then the weather record can provide a reasonably detailed histogram of the conditions that can occur, however, in continental-scale power-system studies considering many aspects of the weather, the input space 1(a)  (b)  (c) Figure 1: An illustration of the input space of a weather-driven model.

By its definition, climate change also shifts of this distribution, leaving older weather records potentially less informative of the future. While global climate/circulation models (GCMs) aim to project future weather patterns, they had prioritized different objectives, resulting in granularity that often falls short of what’s needed here.

We can provide over 10 000 years of independent weather scenarios with higher fidelity than GCMs; and, although derived from past conditions, since they cover the last two decades, these forecasts reflect an atmosphere already influenced by anthropogenic warming [10, p. 42]. 1.2 E NSEMBLE FORECASTS BY THE EUROPEAN CENTRE FOR MEDIUM -RANGE WEATHER FORECASTS (ECMWF) The atmospheric weather system is famously a chaotic system, which means even though we can derive deterministic physical laws governing its constituent parts (e.g. differential equations), if we use these laws to predict the future development of the system, any small discrepancy in initial conditions between two scenarios will keep growing until the two predictions appear completely unrelated from each other.
