In this paper, we take analyses usually applied at the industrial level and make them accessible for individual computer science researchers with an easy-to-use Python package. Localizing to the energy mixture of the electrical power grid, we make the conversion from energy usage to CO 2emissions, in addition to contextualizing these results with more human-understandable bench- marks, such as automobile miles driven. We also include comparisons with energy mixtures employed in electrical grids around the world. We propose including these automatically-generated Energy Usage Reports as part of standard algorith- mic accountability practices, and demonstrate the use of these reports as part of model-choice in a machine learning context. 1 Introduction Anthropogenic climate change is a global environmental problem caused by human-induced changes to the global carbon cycle through emissions of greenhouse gases, particularly carbon dioxide (CO 2) (IPCC (2013); Myhre et al.(2013)). Carbon dioxide emissions change the Earth’s energy balance: a higher concentration of CO 2in the atmosphere increases the amount of longwave radiation absorbed by the atmosphere and reradiated to the surface, increasing global average surface temperatures and altering long-term climatic trends (Stocker et al.(2013); Myhre et al.(2013)). In most industrialized countries, the energy sector is one of the top contributors to national CO 2emissions (Myhre et al. (2013)). Minimizing carbon emissions through the use of increasingly efﬁcient computational methods is an appropriate response to climate change under the framework of Environmental Justice (Denton et al.(2014)). Computer scientists could play a central role in reducing carbon emissions economy-wide through the design and implementation of more energy-efﬁcient algorithms. There have been many attempts to measure the carbon footprint of computing (Strubell et al.(2019); Muhammad Arif (2015); Posani (2018); Ensmenger (2018, 2015); Coroama et al.(2015)), with special attention paid to energy-intensive operations such as Bitcoin mining and cloud computing (de Vries (2018); Baliga et al.(2011); Muhammad Arif (2015); Posani (2018)). However, the details of electricity generation and power consumption make it difﬁcult to translate from an individual device’s operations to the energy use and carbon emissions which result from those operations. \u0003This work is funded in part by the Mozilla Responsible Computer Science Challenge and by the NSF under grant IIS-1633387. yBoth authors contributed equally to this research.

In this paper, we introduce a Python package energyusage3that can calculate the energy and CO 2 emissions of a given function as well as output an Energy Usage Report giving context to these results. We argue that any attempts to use algorithms to tackle climate change should also report on the algorithms’ direct emissions impacts. 2 Energy Usage Report When considering the environmental impact of algorithms, it is generally acknowledged that reporting the energy usage and CO 2emissions is the “gold standard\" (Schwartz et al.(2019); Strubell et al. (2019)); it is the standard we adopt here. Efﬁciency and energy usage depends on an entire pipeline of energy generation, from individual computer power loss rates to the balance of the power grid between renewable energy sources, such as wind energy, versus fossil fuel sources, such as coal. Energy source mixtures are different by location, so reporting emissions statistics requires knowledge of where an algorithm was run as well as the speciﬁc energy mixture data for that location.
