In response to these challenges, we propose a novel zero-shot learning approach designed to forecast various climate measure- ments at new and unmonitored locations. Our method surpasses conventional weather forecasting techniques in predicting microclimate variables by leveraging knowledge extracted from other geographic locations. 1 Introduction Micro-climate prediction involves the forecasting and analysis of localized variations in weather conditions within specific, relatively small regions. Unlike broader regional or macro-climate predictions, which provide generalized weather information for large areas, micro-climate predictions focus on understanding the intricacies of weather patterns within smaller, more homogeneous areas. Previous works [ 7,1,3,8] have shown the importance of microclimate prediction for example in [7] an example of a farmer has been discussed, farmer’s decision to fertilize their fields hinged on information from a weather station located 50 miles away. This reliance on distant weather data led to a critical issue when localized temperature variations resulted in freezing conditions at night, causing substantial crop damage. This situation underscores the crucial role of accurate micro-climate prediction. Apart from agriculture, microclimate prediction is indispensable in many fields such as forestry, architecture, urban planning, ecology conservation, and maritime activities and it plays a critical role in optimizing decision-making and resource allocations. It empowers stakeholders to make informed decisions and adapt to localized climate variations effectively and thus can play a pivotal role in addressing climate change. Let’s consider predicting climate variables for a new farm or location, where we lack historical data. Traditional methods for microclimate prediction often require extensive data collection, including ground-based sensors or weather stations, which can be costly and limited in coverage. To solve this problem we look at zero-shot micro-climate prediction which refers to the task of predicting fine-grained environmental conditions at specific locations without relying on direct observations or measurements. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.In this work, we developed a microclimate prediction deep learning model based on the concept of transfer learning, where knowledge acquired from several locations is used to make predictions in another location with limited or no available data. Transfer learning enables the application of predictive models trained on existing climate data to estimate microclimate variables such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and solar radiation in previously unmonitored areas. In these scenarios, usually larger-scale numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are used which provide predictions for larger areas at high resolution. One such model is called the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR) model. Our goal here is to use deep learning and transfer learning to make more accurate forecasts than HRRR model [2] for a previously unmonitored location. Our model is inspired by previous domain adaptation techniques such as [ 11,10,6,12,5] to design the transfer component that transfers the knowledge from the locations with abundant training data to the target location. 2 Methodology In this study, we aim to forecast climate parameters over a time horizon Lystarting from the current timet. Our task involves predicting climate parameter values Yt={yt+1, yt+2,..., y t+Ly|yi∈R}. To achieve this, we take as input a limited preceding window of relevant climate parameters, denoted as Xt={xt−Lx, xt−Lx+1,..., x t|xi∈Rn}where xtrepresents the navailable climate parameters for input at time t, andyt′denotes the target climate parameters of interest at time t′. Our predictions are specific to a particular location, referred to as the \"target station\" ( sttar), characterized by geographic data encompassing latitude, longitude, and elevation, denoted as ℓ(sttar). We will use the notations Xt(sti),Yt(sti)andˆYt(sti)to denote relevant past climate parameters, target climate parameter and the forecasts values for station stiat time t. The historical dataset ( H) consists of past climate parameter values measured at time intervals preceding tfor multiple stations H={(Xt′,Yt′)|t′< t}, forming the foundation for our predictive modeling. In the zero-shot scenario, historical data within Hdoes not include any information about the target station ( (Xt(sttar),Yt(sttar))/∈ H ∀ t). Consequently, we rely solely on available input data from other sources to forecast climate parameters atsttarand the small immediate preceding window of size Lxfor the target station. This method addresses this zero-shot prediction problem by developing and evaluating models capable of accurate climate forecasting at sttarin the absence of historical data specific to that location. 2.1 Model structure The model’s structure is depicted in Figure 1.
