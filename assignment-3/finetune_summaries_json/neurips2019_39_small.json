In this work, we investigate the potential of deep generative learning models, speciﬁcally conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), to simulate the output of a physics-based model of the spatial distribution of the water content of mountain snowpack - the snow water equivalent (SWE). We show preliminary results indicating that the cGAN model is able to learn diverse mappings between meteorological forcings and SWE output. Thus physics based cGANs provide a means for fast and accurate SWE modeling that can have signiﬁcant impact in a variety of applications (e.g., hydropower forecasting, agriculture, and water supply management) Rhoades et al. (2018). In climate science, the Snowpack and SWE are seen as some of the best indicative variables for investigating climate change and its impact. The massive speedups, diverse sampling, and sensitivity/saliency modelling that cGANs can bring to SWE estimation will be extremely important to investigating variables linked to climate change as well as predicting and forecasting the potential effects of climate change to come.

Physics-informed conditional GANs. We formulate our emulation problem as an image-to-image translation task. The goal is to transform an image from domain X, gridded meteorological variables, to domainY, SWE grids. The pipeline of training a GAN emulator of SWE is illustrated in Figure 1. In our setting, training samples from the two domains XandYare assumed paired, f(xi;yi)gN i=1as in Isola et al. (2016). Here we denote by xsamples from domain Xand byysamples from domain Y. Furthermore, the generator takes a noise vector as an additional input, and can generate distributions of realistic and plausible SWE maps for individual days through sampling. We have incorporated certain domain knowledge into our model via additional penalty terms into the optimization loss function, as follows: 1)Areas of higher elevation typically have larger amounts of snow (and therefore SWE), and we add penalties to large errors in such areas accordingly. 2)As a signiﬁcant portion of the data we study covers water areas such as the Paciﬁc Ocean, where no snowpack can exist, we penalize the model harshly for placing SWE values in these areas. 3)We penalize the difference in total SWE between cGAN solutions and physics model output, to ensure that total stored water mass is properly estimated.

Having trained the cGAN model as described above on a training set of 9 years of data (input/output pairs as described above at daily resolution), we have ﬁrst tested its performance on a holdout sample of two years of data. This is a standard regression setting, for which we compute typical performance metrics. Even in this much simpliﬁed setting where we don’t explicitly model time, the model achieves a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 9.54%.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nSimpler and more efficient computational workflows have been achieved with deep generative learning models, specifically conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (cGANs), which have shown impressive results across various applications in the computational sciences. This work investigates the potential of cGANs to simulate the output of a physics-based model of the spatial distribution of water content in mountain snowpack, known as the snow water equivalent (SWE). Preliminary results indicate that the cGAN model can learn diverse mappings between meteorological forcings and SWE output. This provides a means for fast and accurate SWE modeling that can have significant impact in various applications, such as hydropower forecasting, agriculture, and water supply management (Rhoades et al., 2018). In climate science, snowpack and SWE are considered key indicators for investigating climate change and its effects.\n\nThe massive speedups, diverse sampling, and sensitivity/saliency modeling that cGANs can bring to SWE estimation will be crucial for investigating variables linked to climate change and predicting the potential effects of climate change.

These terms include:\n\n1. Areas of higher elevation typically have larger amounts of snow (and therefore SWE), and penalties are added to large errors in such areas accordingly.\n2. A significant portion of the data covers water areas such as the Pacific Ocean, where no snowpack can exist, and the model is penalized harshly for placing SWE values in these areas.\n3. The difference in total SWE between cGAN solutions and physics model output is penalized to ensure that total stored water mass is properly estimated.\n\nFigure 2: Three samples of model inputs (meteorological forcings) on the first 6 columns, physics model output (column 7), cGAN output (column 8), and the difference between physics model and cGAN (column 9).
