A key enabler towards this direction are new satellite missions that freely offer big remote sensing data of high spatio-temporal resolution and global coverage. During the previous decade and because of this surge of big Earth observations, deep learning methods have dominated the remote sensing and crop mapping literature. Nevertheless, deep learning models require large amounts of annotated data that are scarce and hard-to-acquire. To address this problem, transfer learning methods can be used to exploit available annotations and enable crop mapping for other regions, crop types and years of inspection. In this work, we have developed and trained a deep learning model for paddy rice detection in South Korea using Sentinel-1 VH time-series. We then fine-tune the model for i) paddy rice detection in France and Spain and ii) barley detection in the Netherlands. Additionally, we propose a modification in the pre-trained weights in order to incorporate extra input features (Sentinel-1 VV). Our approach shows excellent performance when transferring in different areas for the same crop type and rather promising results when transferring in a different area and crop type. 1 Introduction Food security, but also social and economic development are at high risk due to the population growth and climate change and the pressure they put on agriculture. Several recent studies indicate that the changes in climate cause substantial yield losses at the global level [ 20,19]. At the same time, the production should be increased by 24% until 2030 - compared to 2022 - to achieve zero hunger, while reducing emissions by 6% [ 14]. Apart from climate-friendly policies and practices to ensure and promote the increase of agricultural productivity [ 11], there is also a need of global, timely and precise crop type mapping systems to assist in the monitoring and management of agricultural fields [17], the prediction of crop production [ 21,9] and the effective spatial allocation of the agricultural practices [5]. Earth Observation (EO) data have been extensively used to train Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models to produce crop maps [ 4,18,22,2,3,24,7]. Nevertheless, most approaches require large labeled datasets for training [ 16,10,23]. In reality, ground samples that capture spatio- temporal differences of crops worldwide are scarce and this remains one of the main barriers for global applications [ 8], limiting most studies to small or homogeneous areas. The most trustworthy ∗Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.way to acquire such ground observations is field surveys that are time-consuming, expensive and cannot cover every part of the world (e.g. inaccessible/remote areas). Transfer Learning (TL) [ 15] has been successfully applied to overcome this issue, by improving the learning performance on reduced datasets while decreasing the computational complexity [ 26]. To this direction, a handful of works have been published the past couple of years that apply TL for crop classification using EO data [6, 1, 13, 25]. In this paper, we apply TL on paddy rice mapping using only Sentinel-1 time series, by transferring knowledge from South Korea to European areas, for which there is a small amount of ground samples. We implement and apply a recurrent U-net model to detect paddy in South Korea using Sentinel-1 VH backscatter time-series as input. Then, we explore the capability of transferring the knowledge captured from the paddy rice model to effectively predict i) paddy rice in Spain and France and ii) summer barley in the Netherlands. Moreover, we explore fine-tuning the model by augmenting the input space with Sentinel-1 VV backscatter coefficients. 2 Data & Problem Formulation Data. We used Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 data and computed the 20-day-mean backscattering coefficient (VH|VV) for each pixel for a time-series throughout the growing period. Then we extracted patches of 256x256 pixels for the areas of interest, using Google Earth Engine. All input data were scaled using max-min normalization. The datasets of rice in South Korea (2017-2019), Spain (2021), and France (2020) consist of 12,942, 88, and 134 patches, respectively. The dataset of summer barley in Netherlands (2018) includes 2,280 patches, however with few barley pixels in the patches. In each dataset, 60% of randomly selected patches were used for training and the rest 40% were used for testing. Problem Formulation. The time series of EO data are denoted by xs r,tand the annotated crop data byyc rwhere r, t, s, c represent region, time, feature, and crop type, respectively. In this study, the crop mapping was performed with a recurrent U-net model (h)exploiting time-series during the growing period: ˆ\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
