This circulation can be estimated through Sea Surface Height (SSH) observations, but requires decom- posing the SSH into contributions from balanced and unbalanced motions (BMs and UBMs). This decomposition is particularly pertinent for the novel SWOT satellite, which measures SSH at an unprecedented spatial resolution. Specifically, the requirement, and the goal of this work, is to decompose instantaneous SSH into BMs and UBMs. While a few studies using deep learning (DL) approaches have shown promise in framing this decomposition as an image-to-image translation task, these models struggle to work well across a wide range of spatial scales and require extensive training data, which is scarce in this domain. These challenges are not unique to our task, and pervade many problems requiring multi-scale fidelity. We show that these challenges can be addressed by using zero-phase component analysis (ZCA) whitening and data augmentation; making this a viable option for SSH decomposition across scales. 1 Introduction Oceans play a critical role in Earth’s climate and weather, as they store and circulate large quantities of heat, carbon, and other biogeochemically relevant tracers (Cronin et al., 2019)(Dong et al., 2014). This circulation is composed of many different physical processes across a wide range of scales (Talley, 2011). Inferring circulation patterns plays a vital role in understanding climate variability, as well as management of vital sectors like shipping, fisheries, ocean energy, and marine carbon dioxide removal. Currently the only way to observationally estimate this flow globally and across a wide range of scales is through satellite altimetry, which measures sea surface height (SSH).

However, the relationship is not simple, and depends on the nature of the processes contributing to the flow. These processes can be broadly divided into two categories, balanced motions (BM, slowly evolving) and unbalanced motions (UBM, rapidly evolving) (Torres et al., 2018; Klein et al., 2019). It is essential to decompose the SSH into the contributions from BMs and UBMs before attempting to estimate flow from SSH, particularly when using high spatial resolution SSH data. Theoretically, BMs and UBMs can be decomposed by applying temporal or spatio-temporal filters to data (Jones et al., 2023), but this conventional approach requires data with a temporal resolution on the order of minutes to a few hours. Traditional satellite altimeters are used to produce maps of SSH with spatial and temporal resolution of O(100)km and O(10) days. At these scales BMs are dominant, and no decomposition has been necessary. However, the recently launched Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite provides data in a 2D swath at an unprecedented spatial resolution of 5-10 km (Fu et al., 2024; Chelton, 2024), where BMs and UBMs have comparable magnitudes. However, the SWOT satellite only passes over a region once every 21 days, which does not allow the use of conventional methods for UBM-BM separation that require data at high temporal resolution. Thus, decomposition approaches that can work with only instantaneous SSH observations (snapshots) need to be developed, and this is the focus of our study. With the rapid advancement of machine learning techniques, SSH decomposition may be approached as an Image-to-Image translation problem. A few studies have now used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to decompose the BMs and UBMs (Lguensat et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2024), with some success. However, significant challenges persist due to the multi-scale nature of these fields, implying that there is important detail in the SSH fields across a large range of scales. Often the amount of variance or signal present at different scales can differ by orders of magnitudes, as exemplified by the power law decay of variance across wavenumbers in power spectral density (PSD) plots (Vallis, 2017). Pixel-wise mean squared error (MSE) loss fails to effectively capture patterns across the full range of scales for these multi-scale fields, because this choice of loss tends to prioritize learning the scales with the dominant signal (Rahaman et al., 2019).
