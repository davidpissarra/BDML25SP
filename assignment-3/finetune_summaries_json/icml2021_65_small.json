Introduction Today, climate change is widely recognized as one of the biggest and most threatening global challenges currently facing humanity (Masson-Delmotte et al., 2018). While 72% of adult Americans think global warming is happening, there is a lack of acceptance that it personally affects us and a lack of motivation to address it, according to 2020 national public opinion polling (Howe et al., 2015; Leiserowitz A. & E., 2021). This is demonstrated by how 47% think global warming will harm them little or not at all, and that 2 out of every 3 Americans rarely or never discuss climate change. Lack of public engagement on climate change for any coun- try can threaten its ability to reach its Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce emissions for the Paris agreement. Another critical reason for the lack of motivation for action and disconnect with personal risk acceptance are cognitive 1Stanford University, USA2SkySpecs Inc, USA3University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, USA4Climate Mind, USA5Hippo Insurance, USA6Megagon Labs, USA.

Standard communication about climate change must not ignore these biases, and will likely be ineffective if simply assuming a passive, blank-slate audi- ence (Scheufele, 2014; Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Akin & Landrum, 2017). Several studies suggest that effective and motivating climate communication requires transmis- sion to be shaped based on underlying values, mental and cultural models of the audience and include practical, viable, accessible, and attractive solutions to address it (Carpenter, 2019; Iyengar & Massey, 2019). Our goal is to make climate communication more effective with a recommendation system informed by personal values and powered by climate change concepts mined from cur- rent, reputable, and truthful climate news articles. Inspired by framing theory (Chong & Druckman, 2007), the system aims to present each user with climate change impacts and solutions that are most relevant and motivational based on that user’s personal values. To achieve this, the system must a) access a knowledge base of climate change impacts and solutions b) be provided a user’s motivational proﬁle, and c) rank the climate concepts based on the user’s proﬁle. Fig- ure 1 shows the outline of the proposed recommendation system. Figure 1. Effective climate communications using ClimateKB and relevance characteristics from a user’s proﬁle. The schema for solutions in the knowledge base relies on having impacts standardized, therefore we focus our work (and this proposal) on curating impacts as cause-effect con- cepts before deﬁning a climate solutions schema. Tradition- ally, domain experts would curate the knowledge base with these concepts from a set of climate science articles. How- ever, manual curation is hard to scale and automatic curation techniques fail to generalize well to new domains (AuerPowering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base et al., 2007; Etzioni et al., 2008; Mintz et al., 2009). In this work, we build a novel knowledge discovery system to build a climate knowledge base (ClimateKB) semi-automatically from the articles. Additionally, the climate concepts in Cli- mateKB are linked to motivational reference characteristics by domain experts since it is hard to mine these correlations in the absence of user interaction information. Lastly, we obtain a user motivational proﬁle using a questionnaire and rank the concepts in ClimateKB based on the user’s proﬁle. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst initiative to build a ClimateKB and a climate recommendation system and revisits open research challenges in these problems. To summarize, our main contributions are: (1) a knowl- edge base, ClimateKB, that contains causes and effects of climate change, (2) a knowledge discovery system for popu- lating ClimateKB semi-automatically from text, and (3) a recommendation system powered by ClimateKB.

Despite 72% of adult Americans acknowledging global warming, there is a lack of acceptance that it affects them personally and a lack of motivation to address it (Howe et al., 2015; Leiserowitz & A., 2021). This is evident in the fact that 47% of Americans believe global warming will have little or no impact on them, and two-thirds rarely or never discuss climate change. The lack of public engagement on climate change can hinder a country's ability to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution to reduce emissions under the Paris agreement.\n\nAnother critical factor contributing to the lack of motivation and disconnect with personal risk acceptance is cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, motivated reasoning, and cultural cognition. Standard climate change communication must not ignore these biases and will likely be ineffective if it assumes a passive, blank-slate audience (Scheufele, 2014; Druckman & McGrath, 2019; Akin & Landrum, 2017). Effective and motivating climate communication requires transmission to be shaped based on underlying values, mental, and cultural models of the audience, as well as practical, viable, accessible, and attractive solutions (Carpenter, 2019; Iyengar & Massey, 2019).\n\nOur goal is to make climate communication more effective by developing a recommendation system informed by personal values and powered by climate change concepts mined from current, reputable, and truthful climate news articles. Inspired by framing theory (Chong & Druckman, 2007), the system aims to present each user with climate change impacts and solutions that are most relevant and motivational based on their personal values. To achieve this, the system must:\n\n1. Access a knowledge base of climate change impacts and solutions\n2. Obtain a user's motivational profile\n3. Rank the climate concepts based on the user's profile\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the proposed recommendation system.\n\nFigure 1: Effective climate communications using ClimateKB and relevance characteristics from a user's profile.\n\nThe schema for solutions in the knowledge base relies on having impacts standardized. Therefore, we focus on curating impacts as cause-effect concepts before defining a climate solutions schema.
