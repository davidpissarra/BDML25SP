We propose us- ing advanced language models and vision transformers to extract and categorize experimental data from various research papers.

Textile dyes are responsible for 20% of global water pollution [2,3], with the relative damage growing daily to the finite freshwater on our planet. Furthermore, textile dyes in water have polluted agricultural areas and caused significant health damage to humans, animals, and plants [5]. Many techniques exist for processing textile dye effluent. However each method has positive and negative elements. For example, bioabsorption generates new forms of waste that need to be incinerated, utilized, or reprocessed [4]. A promising technique is mycoremediation, where natural fungal materials are used to break down the chemical structure of dyes into constituent components of CO2 and water. Mycoremediation has many potential advantages, including the ability to grow the substrate at low cost, generally understood positive interactions with soils, and the ability to degrade specific dye types. However, while substantial research exists on mycoremediation, few scale implementations exist [5]. While not conclusive, a recent review of patents in the field also indicates that there has not been a significant shift from research to production [5]. Known challenges include the fact that while many point solutions exist, each experiment is sufficiently unique, so it is challenging to generalize to a new case and feel confident about the specific method that should be used. Figure 1 shows a simple example of the importance of process to decolorization efficacy. 150 mL of dye effluent was prepared by mixing 20 g of Rit Dye [17] in one liter of distilled water. One cup of trametes versicolor fungi was added and the combination was placed on a shaking table. After 2 weeks, the fungi were filtered out and another cup of fresh tramates versicolor was added. After 2 more weeks, the color of the resulting solution is measured via spectroscopy. A second experiment uses the same dye concentration, fungal mass, timeframe and agitation, but in this case placed all Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: A Mycoremediation Experiment. The figures, left to right, show the experiment testbed, color change from start (leftmost), single cycle experiment (middle) and 2 cycle experiment (right). The final figure shows the spectrometry graph, indicating that while both experiments show value, the second approach gets much closer to distilled water the fungi in the solution at the start and left it for four weeks. The decolorization levels are notably different. This appears to be a problem to which machine learning can add value. The fundamental chemistry of mycoremediation, particularly for dyes, is known. However, the precise results are heavily dependent on environmental factors. Machine learning can discover the patterns within these relationships. There are more than 10,000 types of dye [7] and hundreds of strains of available fungi with mycoremediation potential [6], making it challenging to create simple models that can match fungi and dye. The challenge for applying machine learning is the lack of datasets. To our knowledge, no large-scale datasets exist for mycoremediation processes for dye treatment. 2 Methodology Figure 2 describes our proposed methodology. We employ a web crawler to search for published research at the intersection of mycoremediation and dyes. Any publicly accessible PDF files are processed via a data processing pipeline to extract experiments contributed by each paper. The first step is to select whether the paper contributes unique experiments or is a review article. If it is the former, the PDF is processed in a number of ways (see Figure 2). with the goal of extracting one row of information for every unique experiment in the paper. By manually examining literature on dye mycoremediation, we have determined that the key factors affecting the performance of dye decolorization (besides the specific fungi and dye) are temperature, pH, agitation (shaking or stirring), timeframe, dye concentration, and fungal mass per unit of dye volume. The decolorization efficacy is often measured by color change spectroscopy and reported as a percentage improvement. Therefore, the pipeline attempts to extract each of these values for every unique experiment reported in every paper. From an experimental standpoint, we intend to conduct an ablation study to explore the sensitivity of extraction effectiveness to different pipeline techniques. Figure 2 shows our planned study where each PDF is processed by using text extraction, segmented into pages with text-based retrieval augmented generation [9], page selection performed by a vision transformer, or fed directly into a large language model.
