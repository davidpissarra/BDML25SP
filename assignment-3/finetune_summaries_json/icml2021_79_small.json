Aerial im- agery allows for tree species or family classiﬁ- cation, which improves on the satellite imagery- based forest type classiﬁcation. However, aerial imagery is signiﬁcantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by how much the higher reso- lution improves the forest carbon estimation.

Introduction The deterioration of the natural world is unparalleled in human history and a key driver of the climate crisis. Since 2000, we have lost 361 million ha of forest cover (the size of Europe) (Hansen et al., 2013) accounting for 18% of global anthropogenic emissions (IPCC, 2019). The causes of deforestation are mostly economically driven and major conservation efforts are underway to mitigate and safeguard against these losses. Carbon offsets are a way of ﬁnancing and trading on the capture of carbon for businesses and governments. The carbon offsetting market is expected to grow by a factor of 100 until 2050 and demand is rapidly increasing (Blaufelder et al.). Recent investigations (Badgley et al., 2021) have shown that the current manual practices systematically overesti- mate forestry carbon offsetting projects with up to 29% of the offsets analyzed, totaling up to 30 million tCO2e and worth approximately $410 million. There is thus a need for higher quality carbon offsetting protocols and higher trans- parency and accountability in the monitoring, reporting, and veriﬁcation (MRV) of these projects (Haya et al., 2020). Several veriﬁcation bodies and academic environments are currently developing remote sensing technologies to auto- mate parts of the certiﬁcation process of forestry carbon offsetting projects (Narine et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2019). Remote sensing through satellite or aerial imagery and lidar combined with ML models can be used to estimate carbon stock baselines and additionality, and for MRV of projects. Compared to current manual estimates, these advancements reduce time and cost and increase transparency and account- ability, thus lowering the threshold for forest owners and buyers to enter the market (L ¨utjens et al., 2019). Satellite imagery is increasing in quality and availability and combined with state-of-the-art deep learning, promises to soon map every tree on earth (Hanan & Anchang, 2020). Nevertheless, these algorithms risk additionally contribut- ing to the systematic overestimation of carbon stocks, not reducing it.Tackling the Overestimation of Forest Carbon with DL and Aerial Imagery Table 1.

Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which improves on satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However, aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect, and it is unclear by how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation. In this proposal paper, we describe the first systematic comparison of forest carbon estimation from aerial imagery, satellite imagery, and \"ground-truth\" field measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by more than 10 times for tropical reforestation projects. The significant difference between aerial and satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance of extending this study to a global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.\n\nThe deterioration of the natural world is unparalleled in human history and a key driver of the climate crisis.
