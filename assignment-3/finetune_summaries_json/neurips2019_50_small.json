To date, researchers have been unable to quantify the aggregate leakage rate from these deposits into the atmosphere and predict how it might change with increasing temperatures. We aim to apply machine learning methods to study the extent of this climate hazard and inform the deployment of mitigation strategies. By combining a computer vision-assisted analysis of satellite data with targeted ﬁeld measurements, we seek to (1) determine the number of concentrated methane seeps, (2) estimate their ﬂow rates, and (3) understand how they change with increasing temperatures. Identifying methane seeps via direct imaging of the CH 4absorption spectra is challenging. However, visual, thermal and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) proxy signals demarcate several reported categories of concentrated methane release sources, such arctic lakes, seabed clathrate releases, and methane hills. Faster permafrost thaw beneath arctic lakes causes anomalous freezing patterns that can be seen from satellites, creating a signal that is readily detected with computer vision techniques [2]. 2 Remote Methane Detection Methane is an odourless, colorless gas that has a narrow absorption spectra in in the mid-infrared range, making it non-trivial to detect with standard remote sensing instruments. A small amount of ground truth data from these methane releases has been collected in ﬁeld by geologists. In addition, NASA’s ABOVE initiative collects data from methane sensors mounted on an airplane in sub regions of Alaska. While it is possible to use modiﬁed airplane ﬂyovers to map larger areas, the permafrost represents 9% of Earth’s surface, and seeps are unevenly distributed within that region, making a localized-sensing approach or manual ﬁeld measurements prohibitive from both a cost and emissions perspective. There are two satellites in orbit equipped with the specialized instruments to detect methane directly: Sentinel-5P has instrumentation with great sensitivity, but with a resolution on the order of several kilometers; GHGSat’s Claire conversely has a 50-meter resolution but its sensitivity is above the threshold typical for ﬂow rates in the permafrost. The seeps of interest are therefore undetectable by existing space-based remote sensing solutions. Without the ability to directly detect these permafrost methane seeps locally or remotely, we focus on indirect detection methods. Speciﬁcally, we seek to identify methane released underneath arctic lakes, where sufﬁcient ﬂow rates lead to abnormal freezing patterns in the winter. This phenomenon yields a distinct visual, thermal and SAR signature. The broader spectrum of this indirect signal allows detection via imaging from existing low-earth orbit satellite swarms. 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.3 Methods Due to the limited number of known locations of methane-seeping lakes, we propose a semi- supervised anomaly detection approach. We propose to: 1. Acquire satellite data with that meet the necessary resolution and quality requirements: (a) Spatial resolution: anomalous features may be only a few meters across in the winter (b)Temporal resolution: to detect seeps, we need a small number of clear summer and winter images. To determine ﬂow rates, we need to capture a high frequency of images during freeze and thaw season. (c)Quality control: regions of interest must be relatively cloud free with minimal shadows and artifacts. 2.Identify bodies of water using classical remote sensing techniques, such as NDWI threshold, pixel-wise cross entropy and random forests, and appropriate ﬁltering. Sentinel-2 data is suitable for this task due to its relatively high spatial resolution (most bands of interest are 10m), a reasonable temporal resolution (constellation revisit time is 5 days), and a robust QA-band for cloud masking. In our experiments, simple techniques performed well in summer months, but occasionally misclassiﬁed ice as water. Combining NDWI and a pixel-wise max entropy classiﬁer improved performance, although we still noticed noise in the classiﬁcation process, suggesting that additional human veriﬁcation may be required. 3.Separate saline bodies, lakes, glaciers and rivers, as those all have different freezing patterns. For the Alaska region, we have found the vector lake dataset [3] to be suitable for imaging data from 2018-19. The dataset includes 294,273 manually veriﬁed lake contours that have been identiﬁed from digital elevation mapping, normalization for shadows via through various sensors, and cleaning using edge detection. This dataset could be use to train a classiﬁer which minimizes manual intervention for the rest of the arctic region. 4. Compile a time-series of freezing-state cloudless images from the arctic fall and spring for target lakes from Planet Labs RGB & NIR satellite imagery. 5.Find “unusual freezing in lakes” using a clustering approach. Due to a lack of true positives, we must rely on proxy features\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
