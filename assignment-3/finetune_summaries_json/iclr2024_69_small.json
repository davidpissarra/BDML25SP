Solar forecasting based on cloud observations collected by ground- level sky cameras shows promising performance in anticipating short-term solar power fluctuations. However, current deep learning methods often rely on a single dataset with limited sample diversity for training, and thus generalize poorly to new locations and different sky conditions. Moreover, the lack of a standardized dataset hinders the consistent comparison of existing solar forecasting methods. To close these gaps, we propose to build a large-scale standardized sky image dataset — SkyImageNet — by assembling, harmonizing, and processing suitable open-source datasets collected in various geographical locations. An accompany- ing python package will be developed to streamline the process of utilizing Sky- ImageNet in a machine learning framework. We hope that the outcomes of this project will foster the development of more robust forecasting systems, advance the comparability of short-term solar forecasting model performances, and further facilitate the transition to the next generation of sustainable energy systems. 1 I NTRODUCTION Integrating renewable resources, such as solar photovoltaic (PV), into the electricity grid has been recognized as an important pathway towards a low-carbon energy system. However, large-scale integration of PV is challenged by its fluctuating power output, mainly caused by short-term cloud passage events (Nie et al., 2021). Current electricity systems contain a large amount of dispatchable resources (e.g., coal, natural gas, etc.) that can be ramped to fill in for the variability. In contrast, as future grids transition towards a significant share of PV, the rapid loss of power supply within minutes would pose a substantial challenge for grid management. Anticipating such events, even only 5 to 15 minutes in advance, would allow grid operators to efficiently adapt the response of the grid to incoming power supply fluctuations. Short-term solar forecasting, defined as predicting either PV power generation or solar irradiance within a time horizon up to 30 minutes, has historically been challenging because of the complex cloud dynamics. Images taken by ground-level sky cameras (see the right column of Figure 1) contain abundant information of the sky and are capable of providing warning of approaching clouds from minutes to an hour ahead (Yang et al., 2018), making it increasingly popular in short-term solar forecasting (Paletta et al., 2023). *Equal contribution 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 Figure 1: On the left, the geographic locations of 72 open-source sky image datasets annotated on the Köppen–Geiger climate map. Adapted from (Nie et al., 2024). On the right, sky images taken by a fish-eye camera under different sky conditions (a) clear sky, (b) partly cloudy, and (c) overcast. In the recent 5 years, the use of deep learning (DL) models, such as CNNs (Sun et al., 2019; Venu- gopal et al., 2019; Feng & Zhang, 2020; Paletta & Lasenby, 2020a; Feng et al., 2022) and RNNs (Zhang et al., 2018; Paletta et al., 2021; 2022b) has seen a significant rise in image-based solar power modelling. These deep learning models achieve superior performance over traditional physics-based models (Chow et al., 2011; Marquez & Coimbra, 2013; Quesada-Ruiz et al., 2014) and machine learning models coupled with hand-crafted feature engineering (Fu & Cheng, 2013; Chu et al., 2013; 2015a;b; Pedro et al., 2019). However, most existing DL-based solar forecasting models trained on datasets with limited spa- tial and temporal coverage, struggle to generalize effectively to new locations. In addition, these DL-based methods show poor anticipation skills under cloudy conditions, for which solar power generation exhibits higher levels of variability, partly due to the lack of diversified cloudy samples for model training (Paletta et al., 2021). The data limitation also hinders the further exploration of more advanced and promising deep learning approaches for solar forecasting, such as foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), which are trained on large-scale datasets and can be fine-tuned to a range of downstream tasks or to new locations (Paletta et al., 2024) with excellent generalization skills. Moreover, the lack of a standardized dataset hinders the consistent comparison of various existing solar forecasting methods (Nie et al., 2022a). 2 R ELATED WORK The increasing release of sky image datasets in recent years has provided great opportunities to ad- dress these limitations.
