In this paper, we propose PE-GNN, a new framework that incorporates spatial context and correlation explicitly into the models. Building on recent advances in geospatial auxiliary task learning and semantic spatial embeddings, our proposed method (1) learns a context-aware vector encoding of the geographic coordinates and (2) predicts spatial autocor- relation in the data in parallel with the main task. We show the effectiveness of our approach on two climate-relevant regression tasks: 3d spatial interpola- tion and air temperature prediction.

While traditional neural network approaches do not have an intuition to account for spatial dynamics, graph neural networks (GNNs) can represent spatial structures graphically. The recent years have seen many applications leveraging GNNs for climate-related modeling tasks in the geographic domain, such as precipitation forecasting [ 2] or traffic modeling [3]. Nonetheless, as we show in this study, GNNs are not necessarily sufficient for modeling complex spatial effects: spatial context can be different at each location, which may be reflected in the relationship with its spatial neighborhood. The study of spatial context and dependencies has attracted increasing attention in the machine learning community, with studies on spatial context embeddings [17, 22] and spatially explicit auxiliary task learning [14]. In this study, we seek to merge these streams of research. We propose the positional encoder graph neural network ( PE-GNN ), a flexible approach for better encoding spatial context into GNN-based predictive models. PE-GNN is highly modular and can work with any GNN backbone. PE-GNN contains a positional encoder (PE) [ 20,17], which learns a contextual embedding for point coordinates throughout training. PE-GNN also generalizes the spatial autocorrelation auxiliary learning approach proposed by [14] to continuous spatial data. Lastly, we train PE-GNN by constructing a novel training graph, based on k-nearest-neighborhood, from a randomly sampled batch of points at each training step. This forces PE to learn generalizable features, as the same point coordinate might have different spatial context (neighbors) at different training steps.
