Under these condi- tions phytoplankton can produce harmful algal blooms which cause rapid oxygen depletion and consequent death of marine plants and animals. Some species are even capable of releasing toxic substances endangering water quality and human health. Monitoring of phytoplankton and early detection of harmful algal blooms is essential for protection of marine flaura and fauna. Recent technological advances have enabled in-situ plankton image capture in real-time at low cost. However, available phytoplankton image databases have several limitations that prevent the practical usage of artificial intelligent models. We present a pipeline for integration of heterogeneous phytoplankton image datasets from around the world into a uni- fied database that can ultimately serve as a benchmark dataset for phytoplankton research and therefore act as an important tool in building versatile machine learn- ing models for climate adaptation planning. A machine learning model for early detection of harmful algal blooms is part of ongoing work. 1 Introduction Climate change is causing progressive warming, acidification, and de-oxygenation of oceans[ 8]. These conditions produce Harmful Algae Blooms (HAB) and diminish the ability of marine fish and plants to survive, thereby endangering the entire marine ecosystem. Excessive proliferation of phytoplankton species causes HABs and may produce hazardous toxins, adversely affecting human health and economic activity. Phytoplankton monitoring and early detection of HABs are vital for protecting marine life, restoring oceans, and developing climate-resilient economies. Artificial intelligence (AI) is widely used in image-based classification of phytoplankton species [9,14]. AI models in turn need to be trained on in-situ phytoplankton images that are sufficiently representative in terms of volume and variety to support early detection and monitoring of HABs. Currently there is no unified database that fulfills this need. Over time, a number of databases have emerged, however they are heterogeneous in multiple ways, e.g. they may capture different types of Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.phytoplankton species from different parts of the world. Hence, there is an imperative need for data integration and standardization. Additionally the quality of images can vary across databases. The image resolution in some datasets is too low to extract distinct features in detail [ 10]. Most public datasets comprise gray-scaled images hence lack RGB representations that typically retain more details on phytoplankton characteristics. Public image databases also do not necessarily cover target phytoplankton species for in-situ ap- plications (e.g. aquaculture farms). For instance, the WHOI database, the world’s largest plankton classification database, includes over 3.4 million expert-labeled low-resolution gray-scaled images across 70 classes [ 13]. The RGB image dataset PMID2019 has higher-resolution images, but it only includes 10,819 labeled images for 24 distinct classes [ 10]. For reliable and representative machine learning models suitable for real-world application, a unified, benchmark database of sufficient quality, variety, and volume is required. 1.1 Proposed Solution and Climate Impact This work presents an approach towards developing a pipeline for integration and standardization of image databases. The key output is a geographically representative, unified, labeled phytoplankton database. The proposed pipeline is generic and can be applied widely for curation of real-world data from natural environments. It can support training of AI models such as those for early detection of HAB outbreaks, ultimately contributing to climate resilience and adaptation efforts. 2 Methodology Aquaculture sites from Brazil, South Africa, Ireland, Argentina and Scotland have provided a list of target phytoplankton species considering the organisms usually encountered in local monitoring campaigns. The list is organized by genus to support research on public databases and further AI development (Figure 1). Figure 1: Target phytoplankton organisms within aquaculture farms of Brazil, South Africa, Argentina, Ireland, South Africa and Scotland. The information is organized by genus. Recent articles (from 2017 onwards) covering the construction of phytoplankton datasets or image- based models for phytoplankton classification have been studied. The availability of images for each target phytoplankton genus is analyzed in each cited or provided database. The images are organized by genus for further integration. 22.1 Data Integration Pipeline The proposed methodology uses the most comprehensive public dataset (WHOI) as basis for data processing. Output data are gray-scaled images of fixed size. Phytoplankton organisms are represented at a fixed scaled considering expected size ranges within target genus. Figure 2 illustrates the data integration pipeline. Figure 2: Pipeline for dataset integration. Gray operations represent auxiliary processing.
