BESS can balance time-varying electricity demand and supply in the spot market through energy arbitrage and in the frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) market through service enablement or delivery. Effective algorithms are needed for the optimal participation of BESS in multiple markets. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we present a BESS bidding strategy in the joint spot and contingency FCAS markets, leveraging a transformer-based temporal feature extractor to exploit the temporal trends of volatile energy prices. We validate our strategy on real-world historical energy prices in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). We demonstrate that the novel DRL-based bidding strategy significantly outperforms benchmarks. The simulation also reveals that the joint bidding in both the spot and contingency FCAS markets can yield a much higher profit than in individual markets. Our work provides a viable use case for the BESS, contributing to the power system operation with high penetration of renewables. 1 Introduction and Background Global warming will likely exceed 1.5 degrees Celsius in the 21st century, despite the nationally deter- mined contributions (NDCs) committed before the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) [ 1]. Mitigation efforts must be accelerated more urgently and rapidly [ 1]. As the main pillar for decarbonization, variable renewable energy (VRE) generation has been increasingly adopted in modern power systems [ 2]. This has also called for more energy storage to balance the increasing VRE generation for system reliability and security [ 2,3]. Battery energy storage systems (BESS) can swiftly switch between two working modes, i.e., discharge and charge (storage) [ 4], in response ∗Corresponding author: Hao Wang <hao.wang2@monash.edu>.

Such demand-supply mismatches are reflected by price fluctuations in the real-time electricity spot market [5], which creates the financial incentive for the BESS to enter into the spot market for price arbitrage (i.e., buy low and sell high). Balancing demand-supply mismatch to minimize price volatility and market distortion is also in the consumer’s interest. Apart from spot market participation, the BESS can also be financially rewarded for providing frequency control ancillary services (FCAS) [ 6] in the FCAS market for maintaining system security. Considering the multiple revenue streams the BESS is exposed to, optimal scheduling to participate in both spot and FCAS markets at the same time (i.e., joint bidding) is critical to unlocking the BESS’ full potential in supporting a high VRE power system. Joint bidding is, however, challenging because the BESS has limited capacity, and energy prices are highly stochastic. In addressing the concern above, the most explored approach in the literature is to derive real-time bidding strategies through stochastic optimization [ 7,8], whose performance heavily relies on the quality of price forecasting. It is, however, notoriously difficult to forecast energy prices due to the high volatility of the spot and FCAS markets [ 9] and complex price drivers. Alternatively, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based methods have drawn increasing attention lately for their model- free paradigm and data-driven characteristics [ 10–12]. DRL can adaptively capture the dynamics of the electricity market in an online manner since it learns from historical data and past experiences. Such learned dynamics would enable the DRL to yield a fast and better response even facing frequent unexpected shifts in the underlying distribution of market prices [13]. However, it appears that there is a significant research gap in the literature. BESS joint bidding in multiple markets has not been adequately investigated [ 7,8,14,15], particularly in contingency FCAS. The existing DRL-based methods [ 16,17,10–12,18] tend to overlook the hidden temporal information inside the volatile streaming market prices. The novelty of our work shows that extracting the inherent temporal patterns in the underlying market prices will make the bidding strategy aware of and sensitive to recent changes in energy prices, thereby making better bidding decisions. In particular, we develop a temporal-aware DRL-based bidding strategy for the BESS participating in both the energy spot (ES) and contingency FCAS markets. It leverages a transformer-based temporal feature extractor (TTFE) to fully unlock the value of multiple streaming energy prices in both markets. The new temporal-aware approach will help the BESS optimize charge/discharge for energy arbitrage and bid capacity for FCAS service enablement to maximize the overall revenue. We validate our method using the realistic electricity market data collected from the Australian National Electricity Market\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
