We propose a solution to address their classiﬁcation and semantic segmentation challenge. We approach this problem by generating pseudo labels for both classiﬁcation and segmentation during training and slowly incrementing the amount by which the pseudo label loss affects the ﬁnal loss. Using this semi-supervised method of training helped us improve our baseline supervised loss by a huge margin for classiﬁcation, allowing the model to generalize and perform better on the validation and test splits of the dataset. In this paper, we compare and contrast the various methods and models for image classiﬁcation and semantic segmentation on the FloodNet dataset. 1 Introduction The frequency and severity of natural disasters threaten human health, infrastructure and natural systems. It is extremely crucial to have accurate, timely and understandable information to improve our disaster management systems. Rapid data collection from remote areas can be easily facilitated using small unmanned aerial systems which provide high-resolution images. Visual scene under- standing of these collected images is vital for quick response and large scale recovery post-natural disaster. Classiﬁcation and segmentation tasks are ﬁtting in such situations as they can provide scene information to help the task force make decisions. One of the major challenges with generating a vision dataset is the cost of labeling the data, es- pecially for semantic segmentation. This often leads to labels only for a small percentage of the data which gives rise to the need for semi-supervised methods that can produce results that are on par with supervised methods. Another challenge that we face apart from the lack of labeled dataset is the heavy class imbalance. Lack of labeled data coupled with class imbalance makes it a very challenging task to solve. Our contribution in this paper is two folds: semi-supervised classiﬁcation and semi-supervised semantic segmentation. Through our approach, we try to tackle these problems and produce creditable results. 2 Related Works Supervised Classiﬁcation: Over the years, several architectures and methods have emerged which have leveraged extensive datasets like ImageNet Deng et al.

The architectures used in our paper are ResNet He et al. (2016) and EfﬁcientNet Tan and Le (2019). ResNet proposes residual connection architecture which makes it feasible to train networks with a large number of layers without escalating the training error percentage. Using the technique of skip connections, it resolves the issue of vanishing gradient. EfﬁcientNet proposes a simple but highly effective scaling method that can be used to scale up any model architecture to any target resource constraints while maintaining model efﬁciency. They observed the effects of model scaling and identiﬁed that carefully balancing network depth, width and resolution can lead to better performance. Supervised Semantic Segmentation: Segmentation aids in extracting the maximum amount of information from an image. Semantic segmentation associates every pixel of an image with a class label. Deep learning models like UNet Ronneberger et al. (2015), PSPNet Zhao et al. (2017) and DeepLabV3+ (DLV3+) Chen et al. (2018) have provided exceptional results for this task. The architecture of UNet is divided into two parts: contracting path and expansive path. The con- tracting path follows the generic framework of a convolutional network while the expansive path undergoes deconvolution to reconstruct the segmented image. PSPNet exploits the capability of global context information using different region-based context aggregation by introducing a pyramid pooling module with the proposed pyramid scene parsing. DeepLabV3+ is a reﬁnement of DeepLabV3 which uses atrous convolution. Atrous convolution is a powerful tool to explicitly adjust the ﬁlter’s ﬁeld-of-view as well as control the resolution of feature responses computed by Deep Convolution Neural Network. Semi-supervised Approach: Pseudo-Label Lee (2013) proposes a simple semi-supervised learning approach. The idea is to train the neural network in a supervised fashion with both labeled and unlabeled data simultaneously. For unlabeled data, pseudo labels are generated by selecting the class which has maximum predicted probability. This is in effect equivalent to Entropy Regularization Chapelle et al. (2006). It favors a low-density separation between classes, a commonly assumed prior for semi-supervised learning. 3 Classiﬁcation The dataset has 2343 images of dimensions 3000\u00024000\u00023divided into train(1445), valid(450) and test(448) splits.
