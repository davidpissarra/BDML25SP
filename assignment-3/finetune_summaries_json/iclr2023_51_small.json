Our method uses U-Net (a deep convolutional neural network) as a backbone, and a novel loss function given by the combination of a pixelwise bias component (Mean Absolute Error) and a spatial accuracy com- ponent (Fractions Skill Score). We evaluate the proposed approach by adjusting extreme rainfall from the popular ERA5 reanalysis dataset, using the multi-source observational dataset MSWEP as a target. We focus on a sample of extreme rain- fall events induced by tropical cyclones and show that the proposed method sig- nificantly reduces both the MAE (by 16%) and FSS (by 53%) of ERA5. 1 I NTRODUCTION Tropical cyclones (TCs) are one of the costliest and deadliest natural hazards due to the combination of their strong winds and induced storm surges and heavy precipitation, which can cause devastating floods (Mendelsohn et al., 2012). Unfortunately, due to its high spatio-temporal variability, complex underlying physical processes, and lack of high-quality observations, precipitation is still one of the most challenging aspects of a TC to model (Zhao et al., 2022). However, as precipitation is a key forcing variable for hydrological processes acting across multiple space-time scales, accurate precipitation input is crucial for reliable hydrological simulations and forecasts which can be used to inform disaster risk management decisions. A popular source of precipitation data is the ERA5 reanalysis dataset, frequently used as input to hydrological models when studying floods (Harrigan et al., 2020; Dullaart et al., 2020; Cantoni et al., 2022; Wanzala et al., 2022). Previous studies found that ERA5 systematically underestimates heavy precipitation events Bhattacharyya et al. (2022); Sun et al. (2022), and in particular (as shown later in this paper), the spatial distribution of TC-rainfall in ERA5 has large room for improvement and this is key to accurately identify TC landfall and inform decisions. Here, we present a precipitation post-processing scheme based on U-Net, a popular deep-learning architecture (Ronneberger et al., 2015). Originally developed in the field of medical computer vision (Ronneberger et al., 2015), U-Net (Figure 1) is now ubiquitously used when there is a need to apply a transformation to gridded data without altering the input resolution. Rather than only adjusting the per-pixel precipitation values at each timestep of a given TC, we explicitly design our model to also adjust the spatial distribution of the precipitation; to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to do so. The key novelty of our model is a custom-made loss function, based on the combination of the Fractions Skill Score (FSS; (Roberts & Lean, 2008)) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metrics. We train and validate the model on over 200k time steps from global precipitation events induced 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 by TCs. We show how a U-Net trained with our loss function can reduce the per-pixel MAE of ERA5 precipitation by nearly as much as a U-Net trained with only MAE as the loss function, while out-performing it significantly in terms of improved spatial patterns of precipitation. Finally, we discuss how the outputs of our model can be used for future research. 2 D ATA AND METHODOLOGY 2.1 D ATA We downloaded the hourly global total precipitation fields of ERA5 from the Climate Data Store1 at a resolution of 0.25◦x 0.25◦, between 1980 and 2020. We downloaded precipitation data over the same period also for the MSWEP dataset (a multi-source observational dataset blending gauge, satellite, and reanalysis data, and currently one of the most accurate precipitation datasets Sharifi et al. (2019)), which we used as the gold standard in our study (i.e., as the target for the deep learning model). As MSWEP comes with 3-hourly temporal and 0.1◦x 0.1◦spatial resolution, we regridded ERA5 onto MSWEP’s grid using linear interpolation and aggregated it to a 3-hourly temporal resolution. To locate TC centres, we used the best-track data from the International Best track Archive for Climate Stewardship (IBTrACS) project (version v04r002), at a temporal resolution of 3h. For each timestep in IBTrACS (i.e., the location of a TC in time and space), we cropped ERA5 and MSWEP around a 500 km-radius box centred on that TC\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
