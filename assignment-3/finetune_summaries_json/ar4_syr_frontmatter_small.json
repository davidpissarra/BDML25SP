The IPCCmultivolume assessments have since then played a major rolein assisting governments to adopt and implement policies inresponse to climate change, and in particular have respondedto the need for authoritative advice of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which was established in1992, and its 1997 Kyoto Protocol. Since its establishment, the IPCC has produced a series of Assessment Reports (1990, 1995, 2001 and this one in 2007),Special Reports, Technical Papers and Methodology Reports, which have become standard works of reference, widely used by policymakers, scientists, other experts and students. Themost recent publications include a Special Report on “Car-bon Dioxide Capture and Storage” and one on “Safeguardingthe Ozone Layer and the Global Climate System”, publishedin 2005, and the “Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” re-edited in 2006.
