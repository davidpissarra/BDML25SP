In this paper, we develop a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based method to model the complex and diverse residential load patterns and generate synthetic yet realistic load data. We adopt a generation-focused weight selection method to select model weights to address the mode collapse problem and generate diverse load patterns. We evaluate our method using real-world data and demon- strate that it outperforms three representative state-of-the-art benchmark models in better preserving the sequence level temporal dependencies and aggregated level distributions of load patterns. 1 Introduction Residential energy use accounts for roughly 20% of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [11] in the United States. Responsible energy consumption promotes energy saving, energy efficiency upgrades, and consuming more renewable energy when available, thus reducing carbon footprint and CO2 emissions to tackle climate change. Load profiling, load forecasting and demand response can be performed by analysing residential load data [1, 3, 23, 30] so that the industry can better understanding the residential consumption behavior to greatly inform responsible energy consumption [14]. However, due to the cost-intensive data collection process and privacy concerns of data sharing, the lack of access to diverse and high-quality residential load data becomes a barrier to enabling responsible energy consumption [12, 15, 22]. A lot of effort has been made to study the modeling and generation of residential load to overcome the aforementioned challenges due to the lack of access to residential load data. One category of studies [7, 8, 16, 20, 25] followed a bottom-up approach where individual appliances’ electricity consumption is modeled first and then aggregated to model and generate load data at a household level. Household-level load data can be further aggregated to a group level. Bottom-up approaches are able to generate diverse synthetic data. However, intrusive sensors are often required during the ∗Corresponding author: Hao Wang <hao.wang2@monash.edu>.

The other category of studies [17, 26, 31] followed a top-down approach where the residential load is modeled and generated at the household level directly, for example, using Gaussian Mixture Model or Markov Chain Model. Recently, Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has attracted much attention for generating synthetic energy data. Gu et al. [13] proposed a conditional GAN-based generative model using the Auxiliary Classifier GAN [21] for residential load data generation, which is promising for the low cost and high scalability. However, residential load data can be very diverse because of various housing properties and lifestyles of energy users. Most results generated using the top-down approaches suffer from low diversity problems. To overcome the challenges of GAN-based methods, we develop a novel Residential Load Pattern Generation method (called RLPGen). Our method can better capture the time dependencies within the daily load patterns and generate diverse load data reflecting different lifestyles. We evaluate our method’s performance against three representative benchmarks using real-world data. Our method outperforms all the benchmarks by achieving higher similarity to the real data and better diversity within the generated load patterns. 2 Data Description We use real-world data from the Pecan Street database [24] to train and evaluate our RLPGen method. This database contains smart meter data of hourly load recordings (in kWh). After data cleaning, we obtain the hourly load data of 417 households from Jan. 1, 2017 to Dec. 31, 2017. In our work, we focus on load patterns using normalized hourly smart meter data and develop a novel method (presented in Section 3) to generate diverse daily load patterns reflecting all kinds of real-world consumption behaviors. For our future works, a more comprehensive comparison including non-GAN and non-ML based method can be conducted and further extension can be done on our approach to perform residential load demand data generation. 3 Methodology As existing top-down methods can hardly capture diverse load patterns across various households, whiles existing bottom-up methods are not suitable to overcome the load data shortage and privacy concerns of load data collection, we develop an LSTM-based GAN model along with the weight selection method to learn and generate residential load patterns. Inspired by TimeGAN [28], we 1) introduce autoencoders in the model allowing adversarial training at the hidden space level, and 2) perform weakly-supervised training for finer control over temporal dynamics. We use LSTM units across the model to improve the ability of learning time-series load data. We present the detailed model design and implementation as\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
