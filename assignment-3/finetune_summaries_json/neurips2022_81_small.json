To address this gap, we develop an unsupervised machine learning framework to quantify how storm dynamics affect precipitation extremes and their changes without sacrificing spatial information. Over a wide range of precipitation quantiles, we find that the spatial patterns of extreme precipitation changes are dominated by spatial shifts in storm regimes rather than intrinsic changes in how these storm regimes produce precipitation. 1 Introduction: Understanding the Changing Spatial Patterns of Precipitation Extremes According to the latest IPCC report [ 11], “ there is high confidence that extreme precipitation events across the globe will increase in both intensity and frequency with global warming”. As the severity of storms and tropical cyclones magnifies, there will be associated increases in flood-related risk [ 13] and challenges in water management [ 2,3]. To first order, heavy precipitation extremes are limited by the water vapor holding capacity of the atmosphere, which increases by about 7% per 1K (Kelvin) of warming following an approximate Clausius-Clapeyron scaling [ 24]. This is referred to as the “thermodynamic contribution” to extreme precipitation changes [ 12] and gives a solid theoretical foundation for spatially-averaged changes in precipitation extremes. Yet climate change adaptation requires knowledge of how precipitation extremes will change at thelocal scale, i.e., understanding the changing spatial patterns of precipitation extremes under warming. Focusing on the tropics, where most of the vulnerable world population lives [ 10], these changing spatial patterns are primarily dictated by atmospheric vertical velocity (“dynamical”) changes because horizontal spatial gradients in temperatures are weak. This is referred to as the “dynamic contribution” to extreme precipitation changes [12]. A comprehensive understanding of this “dynamic contribution” remains elusive. Approximate scalings can be derived based on quasi-geostrophic dynamics [18, 23] and convective storm dynam- ics [22,1]. But actionable findings require Earth-like simulations of the present and future climates (e.g., [ 25]), which can resolve regional circulation changes and their effects on storms in their full com- plexity. These simulations are computationally demanding and output large amounts of multi-scale, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.three-dimensional data that challenge traditional data analysis tools. For example, the state-of-the-art high-resolution1, SPCAM (Super Parameterized Community Atmospheric Model, [ 15,16]) simu- lations we will use in this study (SI-A) output 3.4 Terabytes of data, with 76,944,384 samples of precipitation and the corresponding storm-scale vertical velocity fields (see Fig 1 for examples). 200 400 600 800hPa0.0 mm/day(a) 0K 5th % 0.4 mm/day(b) 0K 50th % 8.0 mm/day(c) 0K 85th % 22.7 mm/day(d) 0K 95th % 50 100 Columns200 400 600 800hPa0.0 mm/day(e) +4K 5th % 50 100 Columns0.3 mm/day(f) +4K 50th % 50 100 Columns8.1 mm/day(g) +4K 85th % 50 100 Columns27.6 mm/day(h) +4K 95th % 2.0 1.5 1.0 0.5 0.00.51.01.52.0 m/s  a  b c d e  f g  hLocations of Selected Tropical Vertical Velocity FieldsSelected SPCAM Vertical Velocity Fields Figure 1: Selected vertical velocity fields from our Control (0K, a-d) and Warmed (+4K, e-h) SPCAM simulations.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy parts removed:\n\nClimate change is expected to alter precipitation patterns, but current tools are insufficient to analyze storm-scale outputs from modern climate models objectively. To address this gap, we develop an unsupervised machine learning framework to quantify how storm dynamics affect precipitation extremes and their changes without sacrificing spatial information. Our analysis, covering a wide range of precipitation quantiles, reveals that the spatial patterns of extreme precipitation changes are primarily driven by shifts in storm regimes rather than changes in how these regimes produce precipitation.\n\nUnderstanding the changing spatial patterns of precipitation extremes is crucial for climate change adaptation. According to the latest IPCC report, extreme precipitation events are expected to increase in intensity and frequency with global warming. Heavy precipitation extremes are limited by the water vapor holding capacity of the atmosphere, which increases by about 7% per 1K of warming, following an approximate Clausius-Clapeyron scaling. This \"thermodynamic contribution\" to extreme precipitation changes provides a solid theoretical foundation for spatially-averaged changes in precipitation extremes.\n\nHowever, climate change adaptation requires knowledge of how precipitation extremes will change at the local scale. In the tropics, where most of the world's vulnerable population lives, changing spatial patterns are primarily dictated by atmospheric vertical velocity changes due to weak horizontal temperature gradients. This \"dynamic contribution\" to extreme precipitation changes remains poorly understood. Approximate scalings can be derived from quasi-geostrophic dynamics and convective storm dynamics, but actionable findings require Earth-like simulations of the present and future climates, which can resolve regional circulation changes and their effects on storms in their full complexity.\n\nThese simulations are computationally demanding and output large amounts of multi-scale, three-dimensional data that challenge traditional data analysis tools. For example, high-resolution SPCAM simulations output 3.4 Terabytes of data, with 76,944,384 samples of precipitation and corresponding storm-scale vertical velocity fields.\n\nTo facilitate the interpretation of extreme precipitation changes without sacrificing the details of storm formation, we propose to cluster vertical velocity fields into interpretable regimes via unsupervised machine learning. This allows us to understand changes in precipitation extremes from changes in convection regime dynamics and probability. We define the probability of a regime of convection at a given geographic location as π, and use this discretization to quantify changes in precipitation extremes (Pextreme) from changes in convection regime dynamics and probability.
