It has been established that, just as there are human effects aggravating climate change, there are human actions that can be taken to lower the impacts of climate change on the Earth and individuals. Researchers have proposed applying machine learning (ML) to aid in mitigating the human effects in climate change. Proposed applications of machine learning include identifying to consumers which of their behaviours result in the highest emissions and strategies to reduce them, suggesting the adoption of new technologies to those individuals most amenable to them, and targeting informational interventions to high emission households [ 11]. The success of these machine learning efforts, however, will largely depend on their capacity to effectively impact human climate change perceptions and behaviour. The groundwork for understanding the factors that dictate people’s climate change perceptions and behaviours has been established by research in sociology and psychology. A key driver among these human factors, currently overlooked in most ML for climate change research, is affect. Affect typically refers to the underlying experience of feelings or emotions and can be thought of as an evaluative heuristic that inﬂuences information processing [ 19]. Attention-catching and emotionally engaging informational interventions can be impactful in generating individual or collective action in response to climate change [ 17]. Statistical information about climate change, presented by itself, means very little to people as it requires analytic effortful processing [ 17]. However, information presented about climate change in an affective manner is impactful in improving people’s engagement with climate change, as affective processing of information is fast, somewhat automatic, and motivates action [ 16,17]. It stands to reason that ML approaches for the climate struggle will beneﬁt from interventions that engage with humans in a similarly affective manner. We propose that leveraging social-psychological factors, speciﬁcally affect, will play a critical role in allowing artiﬁcially intelligent agents to interact with humans in a way that maximizes climate change mitigation efforts. We expect that a ML based approach that apprises an individual of some information, such as a strategy to reduce their household emissions, while taking into account social- psychological factors of that individual, like affect, will be more likely to facilitate a behavioural change than many existing approaches. Rather than presenting statistical summary data and generic strategies to reduce the individual’s carbon footprint, the application can encourage or “nudge” [ 14] them to engage in a mitigation strategy based on that individual’s learned affective identity and Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.other relevant social-psychological factors. For example, a middle-class “manly” electrician might install solar panels, but would never give up his big truck, as he considers it part of his identity. So, interventions to reduce emissions by encouraging a more fuel-efﬁcient vehicle could be futile and would be better targeted elsewhere. We envision that using affective machine learning will increase the efﬁcacy of informational interventions and enhance the adoption of mitigative strategies at the individual and group level. 2 Human Social-Psychological Factors of Climate Change Social-psychological factors that play a role in climate change have been identiﬁed in models of human perceptions and willingness to engage in mitigation behaviours [ 15,18]. These social- psychological factors are broken down into four categories: (1) socio-demographics including age, gender, and political afﬁliation; (2) cognitive factors including knowledge of climate change causes, impacts, responses, and response efﬁcacy; (3) experiential processes including personal experience and affect; and (4) socio-cultural inﬂuences including social norms and cultural values. These social- psychological factors identiﬁed predict perceptions and behaviour willingness but are not direct predictors of actual behaviour. However, perceptions and behaviour willingness are direct predictors of actual behaviour [ 1,9]. These models are largely derived using data from Western industrialized democracies and social-psychological factors at play in people’s perceptions and intentions towards climate change may differ in other populations. Of the identiﬁed social-psychological factors relevant to climate change, affect was found to be the single largest predictor [ 15,18]. This justiﬁes researcher’s recommendations that policy-makers emphasize personal and affective climate change interventions [ 15–18] and justiﬁes our call for affect to be incorporated in applications of ML that deal with human effects in climate change. 3 Incorporating Affect in Machine Learning for Climate Change To endow an artiﬁcial agent with the ability to have affectively intelligent interactions in the climate change setting, we propose utilizing an existing approach for affective AI called Bayesian affect control theory (BayesACT) [ 7,13]. BayesACT is based on a comprehensive social psychological theory of human social interaction sociological known as affect control theory [\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
