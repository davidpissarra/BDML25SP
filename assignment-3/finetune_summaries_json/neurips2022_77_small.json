This performance, however, is based on supervision on mesh-gridded weather data without the utilization of raw climate observational data, the gold standard ground truth. In this work we develop a methodology to correct, remap, and fine-tune gridded uniform forecasts of FCN so it can be directly compared against observational ground truth, which is sparse and non-uniform in space and time. This is akin to bias-correction and post-processing of numerical weather prediction (NWP), a routine operation at meteorological and weather forecasting centers across the globe. The Adaptive Fourier Neural Operator (AFNO) architecture is used as the backbone to learn continuous representations of the atmosphere. The spatially and temporally non-uniform output is evaluated by the non-uniform discrete inverse Fourier transform (NUIDFT) given the output query locations. We call this network the Deep-Learning-Corrector-Remapper (DLCR). The improvement in DLCR’s performance against the gold standard ground truth over the baseline’s performance shows its potential to correct, remap, and fine-tune the mesh-gridded forecasts under the supervision of observations. 1 Introduction Reliable weather forecasting models play a crucial role in preparing for the harsh consequences of climate change by providing early warnings of extreme weather events for disaster mitigation. Numerous deep learning (DL)-based weather prediction models have been developed to forecast global weather under the supervision of the reanalysis mesh-gridded data [1 –5]. FCN [6, 7] has shown exemplary performance in high-resolution data-driven global weather forecasting measured by the similarity of its forecasts against mesh-gridded reanalysis data, ERA5 [8]. However, FCN’s mesh- gridded forecasts could not be directly compared against the raw, sparse, non-uniform observations. Yet, the gold standard for weather and climate model performance is their ability to match observations. Further, because FCN is trained on reanalysis data, it is likely to have biases with respect to direct observations. To address these issues, we develop a DL-based grid-free model that remaps and ∗Worked performed during an internship at NVIDIA Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Flowchart of DL Corrector-Remapper (DLCR). DLCR consists of three parts: (i) image patching and coding; (ii) U-shaped AFNO blocks; and (iii) decoding and NUIDFT. The typical size of the output tensor is denoted under the name of each block. corrects the mesh-gridded forecasts to arbitrary locations in space and time. This methodology is sufficiently general that it can be applied to anygridded forecast, not just from FCN. Several data-driven approaches have been developed to refine mesh-gridded forecasts using sparse, non-uniform observational data [9 –11]. However, our objective is different from existing work in the following distinct ways: (1) The desired model should accept arbitrary output query locations, i.e.it should be grid-free (existing works are only suitable for fixed locations); (2) Some observations may be missing randomly over space and time, so the desired model should handle random missing data seamlessly to fully utilize the available data at all locations and time steps; (3) The desired model should be capable of processing large spatio-temporal data from long forecasts, including all relevant variables, at high resolution, which can be highly memory-intensive. To address these challenges, we develop a Fourier-based approach to learn continuous representations of the input data under the supervision of sparse, non-uniform observations. The model is grid- free since the continuous data can be reconstructed from the Fourier coefficients at any location. Moreover, because the network itself is independent of the output query, the model can naturally process missing data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that a grid-free DL model has been developed to re-map and correct mesh-gridded high-resolution weather forecasts to sparse, non-uniform observations. 2 Methodology and Data 2.1 Type II Non-Uniform DFT We use Fourier coefficients for continuous representations of spatio-temporal data. Therefore, the projection of the continuous representation to spatial positions is the real part of type II non-uniform inverse discrete Fourier transform (NUIDFT), which can be written in matrix form as: cos(2 πQMT)Freal−sin(2πQMT)Fimg, (1) where Q∈RN×2denotes the query matrix, M∈RWH×2is the frequency basis, FrealandFimg∈ RWH×1denote the real and imaginary parts of the Fourier coefficients, respectively. The sparse NUIDFT is developed to reduce the memory footprint by dividing the queries into different groups with respect to their actual length and truncating zero elements. For very high-resolution data, query locations can be randomly sub-sampled in each epoch\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
