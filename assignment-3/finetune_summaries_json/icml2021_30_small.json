Introduction Increasing renewable sources (e.g., wind, solar) are inte- grated into modern power grids to reduce emissions. How- ever, due to the intermittent natures of those renewable sources, the original power grid can become fragile, i.e., more easily affected by various risks. Among those risks, the cascading failure is one of the most challenging issues necessary to be addressed (Sun et al., 2019). A cascading failure is deﬁned as a series of consecutive malfunctions of physical components (e.g., power transmission lines, power substations). A cascading failure is typically caused by an unexpected natural disaster such as a hurricane, typhoon, or ﬂood. Severe cascading failures can lead to a total system collapse (i.e., disintegrated into small energized pieces) or even a blackout event (i.e., loss of electricity for the entire city or country).

However, due to the intermittent nature of those renewable sources, the original power grid can become fragile, i.e., more easily affected by various risks. Among those risks, the cascading failure is one of the most challenging issues that need to be addressed (Sun et al., 2019). A cascading failure is defined as a series of consecutive malfunctions of physical components (e.g., power transmission lines, power substations). A cascading failure is typically caused by an unexpected natural disaster such as a hurricane, typhoon, or flood. Severe cascading failures can lead to a total system collapse (i.e., disintegration into small energized pieces) or even a blackout event (i.e., loss of electricity for the entire city or country). To recover the power grid to a healthy state, backup generators need to be turned on.\n\nThe relevance of the cascading failure problem to climate change is:\n\n1.
