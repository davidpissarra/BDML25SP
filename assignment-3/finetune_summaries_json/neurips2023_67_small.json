Reinforcement learning could potentially be used to learn close to optimal solutions for first stage variables of a two-stage stochastic program under different contexts. Under the proposed framework, these solutions would be learned without having to solve the full two-stage stochastic program. We present initial results of training using the DDPG algorithm and present intended future steps to improve performance. 1 Introduction Power systems are a major contributor to climate change because energy production often results in significant greenhouse gas emissions. To combat this challenge, many efforts are being focused on how to integrate, manage, and plan renewable energy (RE) use in the power grid [1, 2, 3]. However, these RE systems (such as wind or solar) can create new difficulties. The energy production of these systems is often stochastic (e.g., there is uncertainty around when or how much the wind will blow). These RE systems also must operate within energy markets which can vary by region and have stochastic prices. Regions typically have two or more markets, often including a long-term–often day-ahead (DA)–market where energy is bid and committed ahead of time, and a short-term, real-time (RT) market, where energy is bid and committed in real time. Markets can compound the challenge of uncertainty, as energy may need to be committed ahead of time without knowing the exact final production of the RE system. Further, power electronic devices (PELs) can greatly influence the operation dynamics in the grid. For example, installing battery storage with a wind farm (WF) can influence how much energy can be committed at different times. To make these RE systems more productive and resilient in the grid, many algorithms, models, and tools are being designed to help make decisions for RE systems in energy markets under different sources of uncertainty [4]. Two-stage stochastic programs (SP) are a common approach for decision making under uncertainty and has been used in many different studies involving RE (see for example, [5, 6, 7]). In two-stage Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023.SP, there are a set of first stage (primary) decision variables which must be decided first and a set of second stage (recourse) decision variables that are decided after the realization of the first stage variables. Two-stage SP often considers a large set of scenarios that contain realizations of the uncertain problem data. In this way, the first stage variables are the same across all scenarios, while the second stage variables can vary between scenarios. Scalability is a key challenge of two-stage SP as a large number of scenarios may be necessary for finding meaningful solutions, and the problem size can increase significantly with more scenarios. To combat this challenge, there are a variety of works that seek to simplify or speed up solution of two-stage SP, such as scenario reduction [8, 9], decomposition techniques [10, 11], or through machine learning [12, 13]. In this work, we propose using reinforcement learning (RL) to learn the first stage solution of a contextual 2-stage SP for the day-ahead bidding strategy of an offshore wind farm (WF). Contextual 2-stage SP differs from 2-stage SP in a sense that there is \"context\" or data that influences the optimal solution but is not a decision variable in the problem (e.g., objective function coefficients). This is motivated in part by the work of Nair et al. [14] who used RL to train a policy to choose first stage solutions of a contextual two-stage SP. However, in their work, all first stage variables were binary while the problem we consider requires continuous first stage variables. Yilmaz and Büyüktahtakin [15] also used RL for 2-stage SP, but they did not incorporate context and used a different setup than we present below. In addition, there are a number of works that use RL for bidding strategies of WFs outside of SP problems [16, 17, 18]. To our knowledge, RL has not been used for learning solutions of contextual 2-stage SP with continuous first stage variables and has not been applied to the offshore WF use case. We present herein our preliminary efforts to build an RL agent and show initial results that suggest that the RL agent starts to learn better actions it should take, but more work is needed to develop a reliable RL agent. 2 Methods The two-stage SP we consider is adapted from [19] where we consider an offshore WF with a battery for storing electricity that can commit to a DA or RT market as shown in (1). maxTX tλDA tPDA t+ΩX ωpωTX t\u0000 λRT t,ωPRT t,ω−λop t,ωPop t,ω−λup t,ωPup t,ω\u0001 (1a) s.t.Gt,ω=PDA t+PRT t,ω+Pop t,ω−Pup t,ω+Pch t,ω−Pdis t\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

To mitigate this issue, efforts are focused on integrating, managing, and planning renewable energy use in the power grid. However, renewable energy systems, such as wind or solar, introduce new challenges. Their energy production is often stochastic, with uncertainty surrounding wind speed and amount. These systems must operate within energy markets that vary by region and have stochastic prices. Markets can compound the challenge of uncertainty, as energy may need to be committed ahead of time without knowing the exact final production of the renewable energy system.\n\nPower electronic devices can influence the operation dynamics in the grid. For example, installing battery storage with a wind farm can affect how much energy can be committed at different times. To make renewable energy systems more productive and resilient in the grid, various algorithms, models, and tools are being developed to help make decisions for renewable energy systems in energy markets under different sources of uncertainty.\n\nTwo-stage stochastic programs are a common approach for decision-making under uncertainty and have been used in many studies involving renewable energy. In two-stage stochastic programs, there are a set of first-stage (primary) decision variables that must be decided first and a set of second-stage (recourse) decision variables that are decided after the realization of the first-stage variables. Two-stage stochastic programs often consider a large set of scenarios that contain realizations of the uncertain problem data. Scalability is a key challenge of two-stage stochastic programs, as a large number of scenarios may be necessary for finding meaningful solutions, and the problem size can increase significantly with more scenarios.\n\nTo address this challenge, various works have sought to simplify or speed up the solution of two-stage stochastic programs, such as scenario reduction, decomposition techniques, or machine learning. In this work, we propose using reinforcement learning to learn the first-stage solution of a contextual two-stage stochastic program for the day-ahead bidding strategy of an offshore wind farm. Contextual two-stage stochastic programs differ from two-stage stochastic programs in that there is \"context\" or data that influences the optimal solution but is not a decision variable in the problem.\n\nOur work is motivated by the use of reinforcement learning to train a policy to choose first-stage solutions of a contextual two-stage stochastic program. However, in our problem, all first-stage variables are continuous, whereas previous work has focused on binary variables. We present our preliminary efforts to build an RL agent and show initial results that suggest the RL agent starts to learn better actions, but more work is needed to develop a reliable RL agent.\n\nMethods\n\nThe two-stage stochastic program we consider is adapted from a previous work, where we consider an offshore wind farm with a battery for storing electricity that can commit to a day-ahead or real-time market. The objective function is to maximize the revenue from selling electricity in the day-ahead and real-time markets, subject to the constraint that the total energy produced by the wind farm and battery must equal the total energy demanded by the grid.\n\nmax TX t λDA t PDA t + Ω X ω pω TX t λRT t,ω PRT t,ω - λop t,ω Pop t,ω - λup t,ω Pup t,ω\n\ns.t.
