The latter are particularly desired when their full-order counterparts portray multiple spatiotemporal fea- tures and demand high processing power and storage capac- ity, such as climate models.

For that, a proper orthogonal decomposition was performed, fol- lowed by a non-intrusive operator inference (OpInf). This sci- entiﬁc machine learning technique was capable of accurately representing and predicting the detailed CO 2concentration ﬁeld for about one year ahead, with a normalized root-mean- square error below 5%. It suggests OpInf-based ROMs may be a reliable alternative for fast response climate-related pre- dictions. Introduction Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) algorithms, which blend data-driven modeling with information about the physics, have been widely employed for improving spa- tiotemporal forecasts in the Earth and climate sciences (Re- ichstein et al. 2019; Schneider, Jeevanjee, and Socolow 2021; Cort ´es-Andr ´es et al. 2022; Willard et al. 2022; Kashinath et al. 2021). Since purely data-driven machine learning (ML) models are not often generalizable beyond the training interval due to their misspeciﬁcation or data dis- tribution shifts, violating fundamental principles, additional constraints are required. By incorporating physical laws on the ML model, it has a considerable gain in performance and robustness, becoming more reliable, generalizable and explainable. One of the primary goals within the PIML ﬁeld is to build reduced-order models (ROMs) for dynamical systems, which are more computationally efﬁcient than their full- order counterparts in spite of possibly being less precise (Willard et al. 2022). In general, these models are suitable in control, optimization and uncertainty quantiﬁcation prob- lems, where multiple high-ﬁdelity numerical simulations are Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Regarding the climate sciences, building ROMs be- comes notably challenging due to the Earth system’s broad range of scales in space and time and to computational lim- itations imposed by its very high number of degrees of free- dom. It is worth mentioning that, when considering state variables deﬁned mainly by small-scale processes, it is of paramount importance to downscale them to a ﬁner reso- lution before proceeding to the dimensionality reduction, when many features of the system are inevitably lost. In the last decade, it was developed a data-driven reduced- order modeling framework based on a non-intrusive opera- tor inference (OpInf) (Peherstorfer and Willcox 2016). This method postulates the shape for the ROM operators based on the knowledge that most physical equations, including those related to ﬂuid ﬂows, are second-order nonlinear.
