Improving our capabilities to anticipate wildﬁres on a global scale is of uttermost importance for mitigating their negative effects. In this work, we create a global ﬁre dataset and demonstrate a prototype for predicting the presence of global burned areas on a sub-seasonal scale with the use of segmentation deep learning models. Particularly, we present an open-access global analysis-ready datacube, which contains a variety of variables related to the seasonal and sub- seasonal ﬁre drivers (climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, human-related variables), as well as the historical burned areas and wildﬁre emissions for 2001-2021. We train a deep learning model, which treats global wildﬁre forecasting as an image segmentation task and skillfully predicts the presence of burned areas 8, 16, 32 and 64 days ahead of time. Our work motivates the use of deep learning for global burned area forecasting and paves the way towards improved anticipation of global wildﬁre patterns. 1 Introduction Fire is a fundamental process in the Earth system, having an integral role in shaping the ecosystems around the globe. Although it has traditionally been considered as a net carbon-neutral process in the long-term, climate change can alter that with the exacerbation of ﬁre weather, that exerts an upwards pressure on global ﬁre activity [ 1]. The expansion of ﬁre to regions of evergreen forests could weaken their status as carbon sinks [ 2,3], releasing the stored carbon into the atmosphere, which in turn provides a feedback to climate change. Additionally, wildﬁres pose a major natural hazard for societies globally causing loss of lives, properties, infrastructures and ecosystem services [4,5]. With changing climate and human activity increasingly affecting ﬁre regimes around the world [ 6,7,1], it is crucial to improve our understanding and anticipation capabilities of the wildﬁre phenomenon in the Earth system. This could foster the development of strategies to mitigate the negative effects of wildﬁres and climate change, with better forestry management, infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness and development of more accurate warning systems. Reichstein et al. [8]and Camps-Valls et al. [9]have argued to leverage the growing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) data and the advances in Machine Learning (ML) and particularly Deep Learning (DL) research to tackle Earth system problems. With respect to wildﬁre modeling, there is a limited amount of open-access datasets that combine variables related to the ﬁre drivers and burned areas. Existing datasets are mostly focused on speciﬁc areas. For example, Kondylatos \u0003Institute for Astronomy, Astrophysics, Space Applications and Remote Sensing Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.arXiv:2211.00534v2  [cs.LG]  6 Nov 2022et al. [10] present a dataset for daily wildﬁre forecasting in the Eastern Mediterranean, while Singla et al. [11] and Graff [12] have published ﬁre occurrence prediction datasets that cover the continental US. Moreover, Huot et al. [13] have made available a ﬁre spread dataset that also covers the US. The limited number of published datasets, as well as the challenges occurring when framing wildﬁre forecasting as an ML task [ 14], can be considered responsible for the limited amount of DL-related works dealing with the problem. Huot et al. [15] use DL models that treat daily wildﬁre forecasting in the US as a segmentation task. Kondylatos et al. [10] use a variety of DL models to forecast ﬁre danger in the Eastern Mediterranean, Yu et al. [16] predict monthly ﬁre in Africa with multi- layer perceptrons and highlight the contribution of oceanic indices. Chen et al. [17] predict global ﬁre emissions on a sub-seasonal to seasonal scale and lastly Zhang et al. [18] predict global ﬁre susceptibility on a monthly temporal resolution. In this work, we present the SeasFire Cube, a ﬁrst of its kind curated global dataset (0.25\u000ex 0.25\u000e x 8-day resolution) for wildﬁre modeling for years 2001-2021 [19] ; it combines historical burned areas and carbon emissions from wildﬁres, which can be used as target variables, along with variables related to the ﬁre drivers (vegetation status, meteorological data, anthropogenic factors, oceanic indices). To demonstrate a potential use of the dataset, we frame wildﬁre forecasting as an image segmentation task and train UNET++[ 20] DL models to predict the presence of global burned areas\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry has conducted research on the impact of climate change on wildﬁre activity. Climate change is expected to exacerbate wildﬁre activity through the worsening of fire weather. Improving our ability to anticipate wildﬁres on a global scale is crucial for mitigating their negative effects. This study creates a global fire dataset and demonstrates a prototype for predicting the presence of global burned areas on a sub-seasonal scale using segmentation deep learning models. A global analysis-ready datacube is presented, containing variables related to seasonal and sub-seasonal fire drivers, including climate, vegetation, oceanic indices, and human-related variables, as well as historical burned areas and wildﬁre emissions from 2001 to 2021. A deep learning model is trained to predict the presence of burned areas 8, 16, 32, and 64 days in advance.\n\nFire is a fundamental process in the Earth system, playing a crucial role in shaping ecosystems worldwide. While traditionally considered a net carbon-neutral process in the long term, climate change can alter this balance by exacerbating fire weather, leading to increased global fire activity. The expansion of fires to evergreen forests can weaken their carbon sink status, releasing stored carbon into the atmosphere, which in turn contributes to climate change. Wildﬁres pose a significant natural hazard globally, causing loss of lives, properties, infrastructure, and ecosystem services. As climate and human activity increasingly affect fire regimes worldwide, it is essential to improve our understanding and anticipation capabilities of the wildﬁre phenomenon in the Earth system. This could lead to the development of strategies to mitigate the negative effects of wildﬁres and climate change, including better forestry management, infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness, and more accurate warning systems.\n\nPrevious research has suggested leveraging open Earth Observation (EO) data and advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) to tackle Earth system problems, including wildﬁre modeling. However, there is a limited amount of open-access datasets that combine variables related to fire drivers and burned areas. Existing datasets are often focused on specific regions. For example, a dataset for daily wildﬁre forecasting in the Eastern Mediterranean has been presented, as well as fire occurrence prediction datasets covering the continental US. A fire spread dataset covering the US has also been made available. The limited number of published datasets and challenges in framing wildﬁre forecasting as an ML task have hindered the development of DL-related works on this problem.\n\nPrevious studies have used DL models to forecast daily wildﬁre activity in the US, forecast fire danger in the Eastern Mediterranean, predict monthly fire in Africa, and predict global fire emissions on a sub-seasonal to seasonal scale. In this work, we present the SeasFire Cube, a curated global dataset for wildﬁre modeling from 2001 to 2021, combining historical burned areas and carbon emissions from wildﬁres with variables related to fire drivers. To demonstrate the potential use of the dataset, we frame wildﬁre forecasting as an image segmentation task and train UNET++ DL models to predict the presence of global burned areas."
