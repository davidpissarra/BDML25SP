Barring strate- gies to address the “volatility” of generation in renewable energy sources, grids with increasing shares of renewable energy will face daunting consquences. These range from wasting of energy through curtailment (i.e., the shutting off of green energy sources when generation exceeds supply) (Spangher et al., 2020), voltage instability, or damage to the physical infrasture of the grid. Indeed, the California grid of 2019 needed to curtail roughly 3% of its energy, with some days seeing up to 33% of solar energy curtailed. One solution to curtailment commonly touted is energy Demand Response (DR) which entails the deferment of energy demand from when it is demanded to when it is most opportune for it to be ﬁlled. DR is essentially costless, as it requires no infrastructure, so it is important as a direct solution. One primary area of application for DR is in buildings. Buildings make up a signiﬁcant, increasing component of US energy demand. In residential and commercial buildings, plug loads represent 30% of total electricity use ((Lanziseraet al., 2013), (Srinivasan et al., 2011)). In addition, the quantity of energy used by plugs is increasing more quickly than any other load type in both residential and commercial buildings (Comstock & Jarzomski, 2012). Machine Learning (ML), while transformative in many sec- tors of the economy, is somewhat underdeveloped when it comes to energy applications. The creation of the AI in Climate Change community exist to bridge this gap, encour- aging the collaboration of research to develop and apply a broad array of techniques into an equally broad array of applications. To encourage exploration in occupant level building DR, we propose to formalize an OpenAI Gym en- vironment for the testing of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents within a single ofﬁce building. 2. Related Works Deep RL is a subﬁeld in ML that trains an agent to choose actions that maximize its rewards in an environment (Sutton & Barto, 1998). RL has had extensive success in complex control environments like Atari games (Mnih et al., 2013) and in previously unsolved domains like PSPACE-complete Sokoban planning (Feng et al., 2020). It has limited success in energy: Google implemented RL controls to reduce en- ergy consumption in data centers by 40%. When DeepMind used a form of multi-agent RL to beat the world champion in the complex and strategic game of Go (Borowiec, 2016), researchers called for similar advancement in RL for power systems (Li & Du, 2018). OpenAI Gym environments are a series of standardized environments that provide platform for benchmarking the progress of learning agents (Brockman et al., 2016). Gym environments allow researcher to create custom environ- ments under a general and widely accepted API frame- work/format that immediately allows deployment of a suite of out-of-the-box RL techniques; therefore therefore so Gym environments tend to concentrate work around the speciﬁc problem that they describe. Other groups have produced OpenAI Gym environments around similar goals but with different scopes. CityLearn aims to integrate multi-agent RL applications for DR inOfﬁceLearn: An OpenAI Gym Environment for Building Level Energy Demand Response connected communities (V ´azquez-Canteli et al., 2019). The environment supports customizing an array of variables in the creation of a heterogenous group of buildings, includ- ing number of buildings, type of buildings, and demand proﬁle. A competition was hosted in CityLearn, in which the creators solicited submissions of agents that could learn appropriately in their environment (Kathirgamanathan et al., 2020). We are unaware of an effort that attempts to focus study around occupant level energy DR in a Gym environment: that is, an effort that focuses on occupant level DR within a building. Therefore, we endeavor in this work to present the OfﬁceLearn Gym environment, an environment that may serve as preparation grounds for experiments implementing DR within real world test buildings. 2.1.

However, grids with increasing shares of renewable energy face significant challenges, including energy waste through curtailment, voltage instability, and damage to the grid's physical infrastructure. Curtailment occurs when renewable energy generation exceeds supply, and it is a common issue in grids with high renewable energy penetration. For example, the California grid in 2019 had to curtail around 3% of its energy, with some days seeing up to 33% of solar energy curtailed.\n\nOne solution to curtailment is Demand Response (DR), which involves deferring energy demand to when it is most opportune to meet it.
