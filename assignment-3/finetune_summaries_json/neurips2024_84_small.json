Existing methods, while effective, often come with high computational demands and associated costs that can limit their practical applications. Addressing these limitations, we propose the Mamba MethaneMapper (MMM), a cost-effective and efficient AI-driven solution designed to enhance methane detection capabilities in hyperspectral images. MMM will incorporate two key innovations that collectively improve performance while managing costs. First, we will utilize a gpu-aware state-space encoder, which opti- mizes the computational resources and efficiency of the system. Second, MMM will use an environment-sensitive module to prioritize image regions likely contain- ing methane emissions, which are then analyzed by our efficient Mamba algorithm. This selective approach not only improves the accuracy of methane detection but also significantly reduces unnecessary computations and memory consumption. 1 Introduction We address the challenge of detecting and pinpointing methane (CH 4) plumes using multispectral and hyperspectral imaging data as an object detection and segmentation problem. Identifying and locating potential methane emission hot spots is a crucial initial step in mitigating global warming caused by greenhouse gases. Methane is responsible for approximately 20% of the global warming effect attributed to greenhouse gases [ 9]. Its Global Warming Potential (GWP) is 86 times greater than that of carbon dioxide (CO 2) over a 20-year timeframe [ 17]. This underscores the urgent need to monitor and reduce methane emissions. Methane persists in the atmosphere for an average of 7.9 years [ 16], and its atmospheric concentration has been rising steadily since the industrial revolution [1]. While the annual increase in methane levels slowed between 1999 and 2006, it began to rise again in 2007 [18]. While methane emission has many sources, the ones of particular interest are those from oil and natural gas industries. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency report, methane emissions from these industries accounts to 84 million tons per year [ 7,13]. Current efforts to detect these sources mostly depend on aerial imagery. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has conducted thousands of aerial surveys in the last decade to collect data using an airborne sensor A VIRIS-NG [ 8]. Several methods have been proposed to detect potential emission sites from such imagery, for example, see [ 19,20,2,12,14,10]. Most existing methods exhibit high sensitivity to background context and variations in land-cover types, which leads to a substantial number of false positives. These false detections typically require considerable intervention from domain experts Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: Overview of the MMM architecture: The hyperspectral image input will be processed through a feature selector block. A band-pass filter will isolate the salient bands within the RGB (400-700nm) and SWIR (2000-2500nm) channels. These isolated channels will be fed into the backbone feature extractor. The spectral filter will identify potential methane regions, which will be used as masks to select specific spatial locations in the extracted features. These features will then be encoded by the state-space encoder and decoded by the hyperspectral decoder to predict bounding boxes and segmentation masks for methane detection. FNN and S6 refer as the feed-forward network and the Mamba state-space block, respectively. to correct. Kumar et al. [ 14,12,10] addressed these limitations by developing a neural network architecture capable of modeling background distributions to suppress false positives. Their work introduced a hyperspectral transformer model, guided by queries containing prior information about methane hotspots, facilitating accurate feature extraction and achieving state-of-the-art detection performance. However, despite the accuracy of these models, they rely on transformer architecture with attention mechanisms that are computationally inefficient [ 3,11,15]. Attention layers introduce significant overhead in both computational complexity and inference time. To mitigate these inefficiencies, we propose Mamba MethaneMapper (MMM), a novel framework that replaces the attention mechanism in the transformer architectures with a Mamba-S6 [ 3] state space block. This block reduces the quadratic computational complexity of the attention mechanisms to linear complexity. However, due to the nature of the hyperspectral data just replacing attention mechanism will not render to an efficient architecture[ 22]. Therefore, we propose an environment dependent selection strategy in the form of feature selector block. In summary, MMM will incorporate two primary innovative modules. First, it will integrate a GPU- optimized state-space encoder [ 3], which is designed to maximize computational efficiency. Second, MMM will employ an environment-adaptive feature selector to select regions that are likely to contain methane emissions. These prioritized regions will then be processed the mentioned encoder, reducing unnecessary computations and memory usage. 2 Mamba MethaneMapper Architecture Data Overview For initial development and preliminary exploration, we will use the Methane Hot Spots (MHS) dataset [ 10].
