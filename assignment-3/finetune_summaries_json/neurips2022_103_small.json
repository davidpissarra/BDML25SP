Our prel iminary result  shows that our surrogate modeling provides a fast, accurate and cost -effective  solution to methane dispersion simulation s, thus reducing the cycle time of  methane leak detection.     1 Introduction   Methane (CH 4) is a potent greenhouse gas (GHG)  and the second largest contributor to global  warming (next to CO₂). CH 4 lasts in the atmosphere for nearly a decade, which is much less time  than CO₂. However, it absorbs energy much more effectively than CO₂. Methane’s severe impact on  Earth’s warmi ng is reflected in its value of Global Warming Potential (GWP), an index for  comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Methane is estimated to have a GWP  of 84–87 over 20 years  [1]. This highlights the importance of methane remediation  for tackling  climate change.   The global oil and gas industry is one of the primary sources of methane emissions. From its  operations, around 70% of today’s methane emissions are technically possible to be avoided,  according to  the International Energy Agen cy (IEA) ’s estimate  [2]. This speaks of the strong  motivation of leveraging methane detection technologies to mitigate emissions. E merging methane - sensing technologies  developed for this purpose includ e satellites, aerial surveys  and IoT sensors,  among others. For example, ground sensor grids can provide real -time/near real -time measurements  of methane concentration over an area, in order to track emission sources and leak rates  [3, 4]. This  is an inverse problem whose corresponding forward process  is methane dispersion modeling, that  is, computing the downstream pollutant concentration given source leak locations and rates, together  with meteorological variables.   The methane dispersion modeling or simulation belongs to the category of atmospheric d ispersion  modeling where a combination of advection (due to the wind)  and diffusion (due to turbulent eddy  motion) occurs in the air near surface. It is governed by the 3D advection -diffusion equation  which  is a 2nd order Partial Differential Equation (PDE ) [5]. The forward modeling of methane dispersion  is the most computationally expensive component of a non -linear Bayesian regression approach for  methane source attribution, where Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)  simulations based on the  3D advection -diffu sion PDE need to be performed numerous times (e.g., thousands)  [4].
