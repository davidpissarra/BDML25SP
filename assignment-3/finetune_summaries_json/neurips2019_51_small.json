Re- mote sensing is commonly used for MRV but practical solutions are constrained by a lack of labels to train machine learning-based downstream tasks. GeoLabels is an automated MRV system that can rapidly adapt to novel applications by leveraging existing geospatial information and domain expertise to quickly create training sets through data programming. Moreover, GeoLabels uses dimensionality reduction interfaces, allowing non-technical users to create visual labeling functions. 1 Introduction Humanity is in the midst of an unprecedented climate crisis, demanding urgent, decisive action in line with the Paris Agreement. Land use plays a crucial role in our climate, taking up about a quarter of annual anthropogenic carbon emissions. Careless usage of land includes a wide range of critical issues, including deforestation and forest degradation through agriculture, turning natural carbon sinks into carbon sources. Monitoring, Reporting and Veriﬁcation (MRV) of land use is a key task of global forest conservation efforts [ 1], climate ﬁnance instruments, such as REDD+, Payment for Ecosystem Services and biodiversity schemes [ 2]. As such, MRV creates baselines and impact assessments for policy and decision makers. The promise that remote sensing holds for MRV is considerable. Earth observations from aircraft or satellite-based sensors combined with recent advances in computer vision have an enormous potential in automatically monitoring land that is vast and otherwise difﬁcult to access. Although remote sensing provides a huge supply of data of detailed temporal and spatial resolutions, many practical solutions and actionable projects are constrained by a lack of task-speciﬁc labels. Current approaches to this problem require manual labeling (leveraging visual interpretation tools such as Collect Earth [ 3]) and an enormous amount of data cleaning, munging, and handling from domain experts. As such, annotating data for automated systems has become the biggest cost (and time) factor. The lack of available labeled data prevents the rapid adaptation/scaling of systems to new downstream tasks, or for new data sources.

Domain experts can select sets of tiles in different modalities (displayed using dimensionality reduction on tile2vec) and deﬁne visual labeling functions for data programming. domain experts. GeoLabels provides a ﬂexible approach that scales to different ecological and environmental downstream tasks for MRV that require non-technical domain knowledge such as tree species classiﬁcation, land use segmentation or emission tracking. 2 Data Programming for Geospatial Maps GeoLabels applies data programming [ 4], a method that is used to build massive, weakly labeled datasets by allowing users to deﬁne labeling functions instead of hand-labeling individual examples [5]. Based on overlaps of multiple labeling functions for given data points, a generative model is trained in order to predict probabilistic labels. 2.1 Extending Labeling Functions for Geospatial Data Data programming is commonly used for textual data, where unsupervised methods such as Word2Vec [6] are used in order enrich words with high-dimensional representations. The lack of representation that incorporate rich contextual information for geospatial data has previously posed a challenge in writing labeling functions with high discriminate power. Tile2Vec [ 7], a technique for unsupervised representation learning on spatially distributed data has recently been introduced. Using this technique, map tiles can automatically be associated with vector embeddings that encode information such as visual similarity or spatial proximity. As vector embeddings can be generated for different modalities e.g. hyper-spectral satellite images, and spatial environmental and ecological maps, human annotators are able to deﬁne labeling functions that incorporate one or more modalities. For instance, environmental maps (e.g. annual temperature, annual precipitation) combined with ecological maps (e.g. nitrogen mineralization, soil PH) and raw satellite data (e.g. Sentinel, LANDSAT) can provide human annotators enough information to determine reforestation potential [ 8]. Combining overlapping labeling functions with the generated vector embeddings allows for the training of a generative model that automatically estimates the accuracy of the individual labeling functions. 2.2 Dimensionality Reduction as Labeling UI for Domain Experts GeoLabels leverages domain expertise from non-technical users by allowing them to visually design labeling functions with dimensionality reduction (see Figure 1). Tile2Vec representations of different geospatial data sources are mapped to a lower dimension via PCA - allowing domain experts to visually interpret data. The domain experts can then select sets from different sources and deﬁne relationships between them. GeoLabels will automatically generate an internal labeling function from the user’s input (e.g. distance from point x in Tile2Vec space). 3 Discussion GeoLabels facilitates training of machine learning-based MRVs for\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
