Further, we propose using knowledge graphs to model the existing data about the impact of climate policies along with allowing our system to access the data about future climate predictions. Done this way, the model can peek into the past (previous policies) and the future (climate scenarios forecast), paving the way for agencies to evaluate and design strategies and plans for climate change more effectively. 1 Introduction Climate change’s growing urgency has motivated a variety of stakeholders, including governments, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and researchers, to develop and implement climate policies aimed at lowering greenhouse gas emissions and strengthening resilience to climate effects [ 1]. However, these regulations usually emphasize short-term effectiveness and regulatory compliance, frequently overlooking long-term consequences and the intricate interdependencies that characterize climate systems [2]. Current Large Language Models (LLMs) represent tremendous advances in artificial intelligence in recent years [ 3], but they have limits for assessing climate policy. Specifically, these models [ 4] fall short of integrating the extensive diversity of information required for measuring policy success [5], risking missing out on crucial aspects of a program’s influence [ 6]. Furthermore, many LLMs must be trained to predict future climatic conditions precisely, complicating their capacity to produce dependable long-term projections [7]. To address these difficulties we suggest using an agentic LLM system that can access and integrate many sources of information, such as databases containing comprehensive future climate projections, past policy data, and their results. This methodology seeks to bridge the significant gap in current methodologies: inadequate integration of historical data with predictive climate modelling. While current frameworks thoroughly examine previous policies [ 8], there is a noteworthy paucity of instruments for accurately forecasting the impacts of future policies in the context of changing climatic circumstances. Our suggested method bridges this gap, enabling agencies to make more informed and effective climate policy decisions. ∗Corresponding author. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: Node of Knowledge Graph Figure 2: Proposed Agentic LLM 2 Proposed Solution 2.1 Knowledge Graphs Our method will build Knowledge Graphs (KGs) [ 9] to produce a structured representation of past climate policies, reports, and associated data. The LLM agent can better comprehend the links between different policies, the conditions under which they were executed, and their subsequent influence on climate variables if they can access a KG that captures all of this historical background. This contextual awareness enables a more informed appraisal of future policy design, ensuring that the LLM agent considers lessons from earlier endeavours. Figure 1 depicts a KG node for \"Continuous Monitoring of the Ecosystem and Data Generation\" in the Himalayan Ecosystem, with further information offered in a \"summary\" field created using NMSHE Mission document2. This graph was generated using Graph Maker3. Integrating such nodes into our KG improves the LLM’s capacity to analyze and anticipate the impact of new climate policies. 2.2 Accessing Climate Forecasting Data In addition to being able to access past data, we propose that our system should be able to access a curated summary of data from climate forecasting models to evaluate the possible long-term effects of the policies being evaluated. Our motivation for this is an open-source example of such an LLM agent based system - climate-change-assistant4. It provides a summary of the climate data for any geographic location worldwide for conditions such as heat, humidity, drought, precipitation, and storms under various warming scenarios. Building on that idea, our system could potentially have access to a diverse set of sources, such as ocean currents, air currents and any other geological data relevant to the policy being evaluated. 2.3 Putting it all together Integrating KGs (having information about past policies and future prediction) into the LLM agent [10] provides a promising framework for assessing climate policy. This method allows for the simultaneous examination of historical outcomes and future forecasts, resulting in more relevant and successful evaluations of currently active climate policies. This tool allows policymakers to investigate various policy alternatives, understand their possible consequences, and make educated decisions that balance urgent requirements with long-term sustainability. The proposed LLM agent promises a big step forward in climate policy evaluation by combining the capabilities of historical data, predictive modelling, and sophisticated natural language processing. 2NMSHE Mission document 3Graph Maker 4climate-change-assistant 2Figure 3: Workflow of the proposed Agentic LLM system for evaluating climate policy Figure 2 depicts our proposed agentic LLM system that uses short-term and long-term memory [11] to evaluate climate policy.
