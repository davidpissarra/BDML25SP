We perform experiments with FIDLA Rusing data from the South Florida Water Management District, which manages a coastal area that is highly prone to frequent storms and floods. Results show that FIDLA Rperforms better than the current state-of-the-art with several orders of magnitude speedup and with provably better pre-release schedules. The dramatic speedups make it possible for FIDLA Rto be used for real-time flood management. The main contribution of this paper is the effective use of tools for model explainability, allowing us to understand the contribution of the various environmental factors towards its decisions. 1 Introduction Floods can result in catastrophic loss of life [ 6], huge socio-economic impact [ 27], property damage [2], and environmental devastation [ 28]. While flood risks may be on the rise in both frequency and scale because of global climate change[ 26,4], the resulting sea-level rise in coastal areas [ 15] amplify the threats posed by floods. Therefore, improved and real-time flood management is of utmost significance. Managing the control schedules of hydraulic structures, such as dams, gates, pumps, and reservoirs [7] can make controlled flood mitigation possible [1]. Currently, decades of human experience on specific river systems have resulted in rule-based methods [1,16] to decide control schedules. However, the lack of sufficient experience to deal with extreme events leaves us vulnerable to catastrophic floods. Additionally, the schedules may not generalize to complex river systems [ 18]. Soft optimization methods and other physics-based models, which are currently used, are prohibitively slow [10, 16, 24, 3, 9]. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful approach for this domain [ 25]. Although ML- based methods have been used for flood prediction [ 11,21], flood detection [ 22,19], susceptibility assessment [ 17,5], and post-flood management [ 12], they have not been used for flood mitigation. In this paper, we address this gap by applying well-engineered ML methods to the flood mitigation problem. FIDLA R, aForecast Informed DeepLearning Architecture, is trained to mitigate floods after learning from historical observed data. FIDLA Rconsists of two deep learning components. The Flood Manager predicts control schedules, while the Flood Evaluator validates the above output by predicting the water levels resulting from these schedules.
