One such process that links seasonal and interannual climate variability to cyclical biological events is tree phenology in deciduous broadleaf forests. Phenological dates, such as the start and end of the growing season, are critical for understanding the exchange of carbon and water between the biosphere and the atmosphere. Mechanistic prediction of these dates is challenging. Hybrid modelling, which integrates data-driven approaches into complex models, offers a solution. In this work, as a first step towards this goal, train a deep neural network to predict a phenological index from meteorological time series. We find that this approach outperforms traditional process-based models. This highlights the potential of data-driven methods to improve climate predictions. We also analyze which variables and aspects of the time series influence the predicted onset of the season, in order to gain a better understanding of the advantages and limitations of our model. 1 Introduction dayl, sradTmin, Tmax, sp, vp, vpd prcp, snow, swe, pet¯T,¯prcp Wavelet TransformationCalculate Loss update weightslate fusion of static variables ResNet-152 Figure 1: Our approach to predicting the green chromatic coordinate from meteorological variables.

Understanding the future climate is important towards making political decisions for climate change prevention and mitigation. The main method to predict future climate are large Earth’s system models (ESMs). These models need to represent many complex sub-processes that span multiple time scales and spacial scales to make good predictions. One such process is tree phenology in deciduous Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.broadleaf forest. Phenology describes the timing of periodic events in biological life cycles and links them to seasonal and interannual variations in climate[ 12], for example the date when trees start to grow or shed their leafs. Since understanding the length of the season in which the trees carry functional leafs is essential to understand the exchange of carbon and water between the biosphere and the atmosphere [ 28], in this work, we aim to predict the stat of this season (SoS) and end of this season (EoS). Two challenges emerge when predicting these phenological dates. First, the change between dormancy and maximum leafs is not instantaneous but the number and maturity of leaves increases gradually. Hence, researchers have to rely on thresholds. However, previous work demonstrated that the choice of threshold has a significant influence on interannual patterns and long-term trends of these dates [ 14]. Second, the processes that relate meteorological events to these dates are non-linear, complex and not fully understood. Nevertheless, ESMs often rely on simple models that use only very few simple meteorological features, for example [16], or even prescribed phenology, for example [1, 22, 31]. One approach that can aid in addressing these challenges is hybrid modeling, as suggested by [ 15] and applied in similar situations, for example, by [ 3,5]. Hybrid modeling is an approach where, in a complex model, some parts are replaced by data-driven models. For phenology, large datasets are available from satellite observations [ 26], in-situ studies [ 11], and near-remote sensing [ 28,23]. In this work, we present a data-driven model for phenology. This is a first step towards replacing the phenology model in a land surface model (LSM). We train a convolutional neural network (CNN), namely a ResNet-152[ 7], on near-remote sensing observations of a plant phenological index in deciduous broadleaf forest. Near-remote sensing data is available in higher temporal resolutions and is more objective than in-situ observations [ 11]. Further, they are less susceptible to atmospheric disturbance like clouds than satellite observations [ 19]. To tackle the challenges mentioned above, we, first, not only predict the phenological dates SoS and EoS, but daily greenness indices, allowing us to calculate the dates with different thresholds post-hoc. Second, we use a ResNet, which can learn complex relations between meteorological time series and the phenological index from the data. We compare our data-driven approach to two process-based approaches. First, LoGrop-P, the phenology model of JSBACH [ 16], the LSM of ICON-ESM [ 10]; and second, a model that prescribes phenology. We find that the data-driven model reduces the error compared to these models for daily greenness by 16% and for the start of season (SoS) by 47% / 9%. However, we find no improvement in predicting the end of season (EoS) and, in an ablation study, we find that our approach is only slightly better than simpler data-driven models.
