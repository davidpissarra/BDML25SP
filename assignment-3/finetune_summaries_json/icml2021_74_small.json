Introduction Climate change is already impacting global food production (Wolfram & Lobell, 2010). Increasing temperatures, chang- ing precipitation patterns, increased weather variability, and more frequent extreme events are projected to further inten- sify in many developing countries where food production is already challenged (Nakalembe, 2018; Parry et al., 2004). Decision makers need more accurate and timely information on what, where, and how crops are performing to assess food security situations and ground data are required to derived those insights from Earth observations (EO) data (Becker-Reshef et al., 2020; Nakalembe et al., 2021a). Farm- ers are also desperate for actionable information to improve their practices and break the cycle of poverty. EO derived projects on crop conditions, yield and their changes as cli- mate changes can inform programs and policies to guide climate resilient planning, implementation, and program management that directly lead to better outcomes for farm- ers (Becker-Reshef et al., 2019; Nakalembe, 2018). 1University of Maryland, College Park, MD, USA2NASA Har- vest3University of Guelph, Canada.

Copyright 2021 by the author(s).Recent advances in machine learning (ML), cloud comput- ing, and EO technologies have spurred promising solutions toward addressing the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and Targets and provide critical data to inform climate re- silient programs and adaptation planning (Whitcraft et al., 2019; Nakalembe, 2018). The limiting factor today is a lack of ground-truth data for training and validating ML methods that use EO data as inputs. Ground-truth data are particu- larly lacking in rural and underdeveloped regions that are home to most of the world’s 500 million smallholder farmers (Nwanze, 2017). Smallholders produce about 80% of the food consumed in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. They face the greatest losses due to climate change but can also make the biggest contributions toward addressing food insecu- rity in these regions (Nwanze, 2017; McCarthy et al., 2001; Nakalembe et al., 2021a; Nakalembe, 2020; nat, 2020). Ground-truth data required to develop these critical informa- tion products are scarce, often collected opportunistically and on a project-to-project basis (Kerner et al., 2020; Tseng et al., 2020; 2021). There is an urgent need to collect high- quality data sets to advance ML methods that can inform programs to beneﬁt people and ecosystems under-served regions. Given the large geographical areas, complexity of smallholder systems, and need for continuous data col- lection due to the changing nature of land cover/land use, transformative data collection approaches must be scalable, affordable, and equitable (Nakalembe et al., 2021b). We propose a new method for data collection that performs automated windshield surveys by collecting images of road- side objects at regular intervals using vehicle-mounted cam- eras and predicting the locations and labels of objects of in- terest in the images. Our proposed system, called Street2Sat, transforms a set of geo-tagged images collected from a vehi- cle on the road to a set of labeled geo-referenced points with locations corresponding to the object(s) of interest detected in the images. These points can then be used as labels for satellite images. We focus on the use case of mapping small- holder agriculture given urgency for ensuring food security in a changing climate (Nakalembe et al., 2021b; Nakalembe, 2020; nat, 2020). However, this approach could be applied for any use case where objects of interest can be seen from a road, including monitoring housing quality, construction,Street2Sat: Geo-referenced Labeled Datasets from Street-Level Images wildlife, damage assessment and more. In this paper, we describe the details of our Street2Sat system and present initial results from a pilot study in western Kenya in 2020.
