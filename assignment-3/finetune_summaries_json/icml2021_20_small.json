Introduction\n\nThe energy sector is the major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions (World Resources Institute, 2020). The adoption of renewable and distributed energy resources transforms the electric energy system to be more decentralized. This increases the role of low-voltage (LV) grids, which typically make up the largest part of distribution systems but are still the least monitored and controlled. Accurate short-term load and generation forecasts at the LV level, ranging from minutes to days ahead, are becoming essential for grid operators, utilities, building, and district operators, and customers for many applications. Forecasts impact greenhouse gas emissions directly by making the energy systems more efficient and indirectly by enabling a reliable carbon-free energy supply with high utilization of fluctuating renewable energy sources and increasingly unpredictable consumption patterns through electrification of the heating and mobility sectors. Such applications include, for instance, peak load reduction (Rowe et al., 2014) and voltage control (Zufferey et al., 2020). Accurate load forecasts can be used for grid state estimation (Hermanns et al., 2020), rendering a completely measured, hence expensive, grid unnecessary. They can also be used for anomaly detection to increase resilience (Fadlullah et al., 2011) or detect energy theft (Fenza, 2019). Short-term forecasts can inform different participants of services like local and peer-to-peer energy markets (Morstyn et al., 2018), real-time pricing schemes (He et al., 2019), or flexibility applications (Poncˇko & Milanoviˇc, 2018) that are emerging with the energy transition. Haben et al. (2021) provide a recent review of LV load forecasting methods and applications.\n\nLow-voltage demand typically exhibits higher volatility than high-voltage or more aggregated system demand. For this reason, probabilistic forecasts are more appropriate than point forecasts due to their representation of the underlying uncertainty. Whereas point forecasts model the expected value, probabilistic forecasts estimate the distribution for more informed decision-making (see Hong & Fan, 2016, for a review). The distribution can be modeled fully continuous (Pinto et al., 2017; Arora & Taylor, 2016) or approximated by quantile estimates (Wang et al., 2019; Gerossier et al., 2018; Elvers et al., 2019).\n\nFigure 1 gives an example of a probabilistic forecast for a household that had an extraordinary high consumption during the Irish Christmas holidays.
