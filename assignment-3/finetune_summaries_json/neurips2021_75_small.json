Despite the threshold approach has established to detect 4  extreme events, the missing data from hydroclimate data and accurately identifying these events 5  are still major challenges. The advent of machine learning models can help to identify the 6  occurrence of droughts and floods events accurately and efficiently. Therefore, this proposed study 7  will develop a machine learning model with semi-supervised anomaly detection approach to 8  identify hydrological extreme events with ground-based data. As a test case, we will use 45-years 9  record of hydroclimate data in coastal California, where was the driest region in 2012-2015, 10  following with flash floods events. The expected results will increase communitiesâ€™ awareness for 11  hydrological extreme events and enable environmental planning and resource management under 12  climate change 13  1.Introduction 14  Droughts and floods are hydrological extreme events, and most devastating types of natural 15  disasters under the impact from climate change. These events lead to severe socio-economic 16  impacts in climate sensitive regions of the world. Management strategies that minimize the socio-17  economic impacts of floods and droughts can be more effective when we can detect the 18  occurrence of droughts and floods accurately. Under future climate projection scenarios, the 19  frequency of extreme droughts and floods has been increased [6]. Thus, there is an urgent need to 20  accurately detect the occurrence of droughts and floods recently under global climate change.  21   22  Droughts and floods are different physical processes but identifying these events can be done 23  similarly. For example, we can identify droughts and floods events using extreme value theory 24  with threshold approaches. Floods can be detected by using the peak streamflow volume over 25  threshold or as annual maxima events, while droughts can be detected by using hydrological 26  events below a given threshold of deficit stream volume or annual minimum events. However, this 27  approach is sensitive to the selection of threshold level [2] over different years and may produce 28  detection error for extreme events. Additionally, hydroclimate data from either ground-based or 29  satellite products tends to suffer from missing data issue. The Long Short Term-Memory (LSTM) 30  autoendocers approach has provided the advance power for reconstructing data signals to remedy 31  missing data issue [7].    32   33  Given that hydrological extreme events are anomalous events, machine learning (ML)-based 34  anomaly detection can be a promising approach to identify such events. ML-based anomaly 35  detection methods provide an automated and accurate manner, which can save more time than 36  threshold-based approach and human manually identify extreme events. ML-based anomaly 37  detection methods are largely classified into supervised and unsupervised learning approaches. 38 2   Due to the dynamic of floods and droughts, there are supervised learning (support vector machine, 39  extreme machine learning) and unsupervised learning (LSTM auencoders) approaches were used 40  commonly to detect these extreme events [1,3]. Although these approaches can detect extreme 41  events efficiently, there is still needs to improve the accuracy of the performances. However, a 42  recent study that aimed to detect extreme events in water usage shows that a semi-supervised 43  learning outlier detection can outperform the unsupervised learning approaches [5]. This suggests 44  that floods and droughts detection could be improved further with semi-supervised learning 45  outliner detection.  46   47  The main goal of this proposal is to develop a ML-based anomaly detection model with semi-48  supervised approaches to improve the extreme events detection. We will design this model in such 49  way that a) we can easily apply this model to any other region and b) we can run this model with 50  future climate projection scenarios. Our proposed modeling would serve as an early warning 51  system for natural disaster response.   52   53  Contributions:  We will examine the unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection 54  approaches for extreme events from ground-based hydroclimate data. We will perform a semi-55  supervised anomaly detection by obtaining labels from annual maxima and minima approaches. 56  We will also compare several ML-based anomaly detections with threshold approaches to check 57  the performance of extreme events identification. 58   59  2. Modeling Approaches 60  We will examine the central coastal California watersheds, where were the driest areas during the 61  California drought (2012-2015) and followed with many flash floods events.
