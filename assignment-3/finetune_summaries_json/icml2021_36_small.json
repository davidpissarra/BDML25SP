Preliminary results evi- dence improvement in skills for different scores compared to the recent literature. 1. Introduction Streamﬂow forecasting is essential in the planning and oper- ation of water resources, such as supplying cities, electricity production, irrigation, and navigation. It also helps to pre- pare for natural disasters, such as ﬂoods and droughts.

In this paper, we consider the problem of predicting next day streamﬂow given time series of past meteorological data (precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature) and physio- graphic attributes, such as land cover type, soil, topography, etc, of the catchment. We assume to have access to river dis- charge measurements for a certain period to train/calibrate the streamﬂow model.

Introduction\nStreamflow forecasting is essential in the planning and operation of water resources, such as supplying cities, electricity production, irrigation, and navigation. It also helps to prepare for natural disasters, such as floods and droughts. Having accurate methods to predict river discharge in advance would help to manage uncertainties that affect society and the economy, a challenge under climate change.\n\nIn this paper, we consider the problem of predicting next-day streamflow given time series of past meteorological data (precipitation, soil moisture, and temperature) and physiographic attributes, such as land cover type, soil, topography, etc., of the catchment.

Once trained, the model should run on meteorological and physiographic data only, i.e., without access to new streamflow data to update the model.
