Here we demonstrate an artificial intelligence/computer vision (AI/CV)- enabled framework for converting exterior build scans and dimensional data di- rectly into manufacturing and installation specifications for overclad panels. In our workflow point clouds associated with LiDAR-scanned buildings are segmented into a facade feature space, vectorized features are extracted using an iterative random-sampling consensus algorithm, and from this representation an optimal panel design plan satisfying manufacturing constraints is generated. This sys- tem and the corresponding construction process is demonstrated on a test facade structure constructed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). We also include a brief summary of a techno-economic study designed to estimate the potential energy and cost impact of this new system. 1 I NTRODUCTION Buildings rank as the sixth largest greenhouse gas emitters globally, with emissions from homes and businesses accounting for 13% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions (Agency, 2022). Fur- thermore, residential and commercial buildings account for ∼40% of the total US energy demand, roughly 75% of all electricity use, and even more of the peak power demand (EIA, 2012a;b). Thus, increasing building energy efficiency represents a critical sector for reducing emissions. Buildings conforming to today’s energy codes and standards are typically 30% more efficient than those of 10 years ago due to more efficient products and building construction practices (OFFICE, 2016); however, 55% of US homes and 50% of commercial buildings were built before 1980 (EIA, 2012a;b). While existing retrofit technologies can cut building energy use in half (TECHNOLO- GIES & OPPORTUNITIES:, 2015), to significantly reduce energy consumption holistic approaches requiring whole building interventions are required. The cost, invasivity, and disruptive nature of such techniques mean that only a small fraction of existing buildings undergo extensive energy effi- ciency retrofits each year. In order to significantly reduce the emissions impact of the existing building stock on a short enough time horizon to meet current climate goals, there needs to be a significant increase in scaling effi- ciency of retrofit techniques, including cost reduction, labor reduction, resident disruption minimiza- tion, and reproducibility. Furthermore, as the construction industry has fallen behind in adopting ad- vanced technology solutions (e.g. ML, robotics) (Institute, 2017), there is a significant opportunity for AI to make a critical impact. In particular, prefabricated panels (and other off-site construction methods) have the potential to allow for more modular, potentially scalable retrofits, as they minimize demolition and intrusion 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 into the existing building envelope. However, these systems have yet to achieve significant cost reduction or market growth (Today) and still require extensive custom design from an architect at a per building level. This design process is currently difficult to automate as building blueprints and technical schematics often differ substantially from the actual implementation in practice. Therefore, most retrofits necessitate an architect to create a custom model from either hand measurements or LiDAR scans of the actual building; this model is then used to build out the overclad design. This inefficiency represents is a key avenue for AI/ML techniques to make substantial progress to reduce labor in the design process and thus reduce costs. Here we demonstrate an AI/CV enabled automated modeling framework that converts building enve- lope condition and dimensional data into manufacturing and installation specifications. This system will significantly reduce the labor required compared to current techniques where measurement data is manually translated into retrofit specifications. 2 M ETHODS 2.1 D ATA COLLECTION To obtain data detailing the physical characteristics of the existing site a building envelope scanning tool is required. In this study we utilize the Trimble X7 high-speed 3D laser scanning system. This integrated system includes automatic calibration and leveling across multiple scans, producing a fully graded 3D point cloud of the building envelope, with colors, intensity, and normal plane for every point. The resolution of the point cloud depends on the number of scans taken for a given area; in our test dataset this ranges from less than a centimeter to up to 5 cm in less dense regions. Through collaboration with Trimble, we assembled a collection of building scans for training, test- ing, and validation of the machine-learning algorithms. During on-site visits we compiled scan data from a building on the Colorado State University campus, two units in a local multifamily apartment building, and a modular unit on the NREL campus. We then supplemented these data with previously scanned buildings from other Trimble projects, including two collections of whole street scans with multiple building facades. The initial target building typology was low-rise timber-framed multifam- ily buildings; however, if training data representing additional typologies are provided the model can easily be extended. 2.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nBuildings are a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for 13% of total U.S. emissions and 40% of the total U.S. energy demand (Agency, 2022). Increasing building energy efficiency is crucial for reducing emissions. Buildings that conform to today's energy codes and standards are 30% more efficient than those built 10 years ago, but 55% of U.S. homes and 50% of commercial buildings were built before 1980 (EIA, 2012a, b). To significantly reduce energy consumption, holistic approaches requiring whole building interventions are needed. However, the cost, invasiveness, and disruptive nature of such techniques limit their adoption.\n\nTo address this challenge, there is a need for more efficient retrofit techniques, including cost reduction, labor reduction, resident disruption minimization, and reproducibility. The construction industry has been slow to adopt advanced technology solutions, such as machine learning and robotics (Institute, 2017). Prefabricated panels have the potential to enable more modular and scalable retrofits, but they require extensive custom design from an architect at a per building level. This design process is difficult to automate due to the discrepancy between building blueprints and actual implementation.\n\nWe propose an artificial intelligence/computer vision (AI/CV)-enabled framework for converting exterior building scans and dimensional data directly into manufacturing and installation specifications for overclad panels. Our system segments point clouds associated with LiDAR-scanned buildings into a facade feature space, extracts vectorized features using an iterative random-sampling consensus algorithm, and generates an optimal panel design plan satisfying manufacturing constraints. We demonstrate this system on a test facade structure constructed at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL).\n\nOur framework has the potential to significantly reduce labor required in the design process, compared to current techniques where measurement data is manually translated into retrofit specifications. We also conduct a techno-economic study to estimate the potential energy and cost impact of this new system.\n\nTo obtain data detailing the physical characteristics of the existing site, a building envelope scanning tool is required.
