As a proven technology for gas sep- aration in other industrial applications, metal-organic frameworks (MOF) come in virtually unlimited number of crystal combinations in their highly porous lattice and may offer the solution for CO 2capture from atmosphere or industrial point sources. Although MOFs can have highly complex crystal structure, which can- not be easily exploited in tabular data format in conventional ML methods or more recent Deep Learning methods, Graph Neural Networks can easily be trained on their representative crystallographic information ﬁle (CIF) content. In this work, we train GNNs to create an end-to-end workﬂow to screen large number of MOF crystal structures directly from the data within the crystallographic information ﬁles for their CO 2working capacity or CO 2/N2selectivity under low-pressure conditions. Our preliminary results show that a simple 2-layered Graph Convo- lution Networks (GCN) can easily achieve R2score in the range of 0.87 to 0.89, easily. 1 N EED FOR CARBON DIOXIDE CAPTURE Carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) is expected to play an im- portant role in the global campaign to limit global warming to 1.5\u000eC. However, to achieve this ambitious goal, we need to deploy CO 2capture capabilities at gigaton capacity - approximately 150X increment by 2050 (Global CCS Institute, 2020). Currently, CO 2capture using chemical solvents is the most mature technology that has been proven to work at large-scale (Leung et al., 2014). However, these capture systems have large footprints and the energy demand to operate the process is very high. Studies conducted by U.S. National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) suggests that implementing aqueous amine-based CO2 capture can reduce the energy efﬁciency of a coal-ﬁred power plant by 20-30% (Oko et al., 2017). The use of large amount of thermal energy for solvent regeneration accounts for 20-25% of the operating cost despite deploying advanced solvents. Solvent-based capture systems are also expensive to build due to the large footprint of the packed bed towers used for CO 2absorption and desorption. As a result, new separation technologies using either solid sorbents, membranes, or cryogenics are being developed (Abanades et al., 2015) to address the need for new material development to improve the CO2 capture capacity, selectivity over other gases, and to reduce the regeneration energy demand. Hence, there is urgency to develop energy-efﬁcient and compact capture processes to allow widespread adoption of CCUS in the industrial sector and reduce global warming. 2 M ETAL -ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOF) FOR CO2 C APTURE A variety of solid sorbent-based materials are being investigated for their CO 2adsorption capacity, CO 2selectivity, stability, and regeneration capacity to efﬁciently remove CO 2from point sources 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 (Dziejarski et al., 2023). Speciﬁcally, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), a class of highly porous crystalline materials, have come across as promising candidates due to their exceedingly high CO 2 adsorption capacities that are inherently tunable through their unique structural features (Sumida et al., 2012) (Li et al., 2022) and more importantly, their scalability for industrial applications. MOFs are built through transition metal clusters and organic linkers into structural building units (SBUs) that are further extended into well-deﬁned, uniformed structures with high surface area and struc- tural stability. Those highly tunable SBUs in MOFs offer exceptional adaptability in isoreticular manipulation as well as their controllable functionalities in CO 2adsorption through their theoreti- cal, inﬁnite combinations among metal ions, organic linkers, functional group, and optimization of pores spacing (Lu et al., 2022) For post-combustion CO 2capture processes, there is an urgent need to understand the role of impu- rities, water in particular, the variability in the concentrations of impurities in the feed stream and more importantly, their impact on the stability of the sorbents as well as the energy requirement for the regeneration processes. However, to-date, only a small number of MOFs have been studied experimentally to meet target-speciﬁc requirements, which warrants the necessity for a faster and reliable way to design and screen MOFs for post-comb\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nMaterials with high performance and selectivity over other gases, requiring low energy demand, are being developed for large-scale deployment. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a proven technology for gas separation in various industrial applications. MOFs have a virtually unlimited number of crystal combinations in their highly porous lattice, making them a potential solution for CO2 capture from the atmosphere or industrial sources.
