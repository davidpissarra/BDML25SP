The strength of the effect is however heterogeneous, meaning it depends on the surrounding environ- ment, making ACI one of the most uncertain effects in our current climate models. In our work, we use causal machine learning to estimate ACI from satellite obser- vations by reframing the problem as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius). We predict the causal effect of aerosol on clouds with uncertainty bounds depending on the unknown factors that may be influencing the impact of aerosol. Of the three climate models evaluated, we find that only one plausibly recreates the trend, lending more credence to its estimate cooling due to ACI. 1 Introduction Aerosol, in the form of pollution from human emissions, enters the atmosphere and eventually interacts with a cloud leading to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI). As aerosol enters the cloud, a causal chain of events catalyzes. It begins with aerosol particles activating as cloud droplet nuclei, which increases the number of droplets within the cloud, reducing the mean radius of cloud droplets to redistribute the water vapor, and eventually increasing the cloud’s brightness (Figure 1(a)) [1]. Overall, an increase in atmospheric aerosol leads to larger, brighter, longer-lasting clouds that reflect more incoming sunlight. ACI are thus a net cooling process and offset some fraction of warming due to rising levels of CO 2. The strength of the effect is however dependent on the local environment surrounding the cloud. ACI remain one of the most uncertain effects in our current climate models, as current models are limited in their ability to simulate ACI with such environmental heterogeneity [2, 3]. Climate models can only approximate ACI given their low spatial resolution and limited parameterizations, often dependent on only a few environmental parameters, such as the relative humidity within a grid cell. These factors lead to increased uncertainty in future projections. Currently, state-of-the-art climate models estimate that the range of cooling due to ACI may offset 0%-50% of the warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. This work uses causal machine learning to estimate ACI from satellite observations, by reframing the problem as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius). We predict the causal effect of aerosol on clouds and provide uncertainty bounds that we compare to the parameterizations of Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.climate model ACI. We consider uncertainty arising from violations of two assumptions: positivity (or overlap) and unconfoundedness (or no hidden confounding). Positivity violations are due to insufficient representation within the data for all treatment levels, such as \"treating\" cloud with aerosol. Unmeasured confounding are unobserved factors which influence both the treatment and outcomes, such as humidity causing aerosol swelling and altering cloud properties. To better understand these individual sources of uncertainty, we use Overcast [4], a prime example of the needs of a community such as ACI leading to methodological contributions in machine learning. Compared to prior work such as [5], we consider aerosol optical depth (AOD), our proxy for aerosol concentration, as a continuous treatment rather than discrete and perform an uncertainty-aware sensitivity analysis to study the consequences of possible violations of positivity and unconfoundedness.

The treatment is aerosol optical depth (AOD), a proxy for aerosol concentration. The outcome considered is the cloud droplet size ( re).

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nAerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) are a complex process where aerosol particles from human emissions enter the atmosphere and interact with clouds, leading to a net cooling effect. This process is uncertain due to its dependence on the local environment surrounding the cloud. Current climate models struggle to simulate ACI accurately, leading to increased uncertainty in future projections.\n\nACI occurs when aerosol particles activate as cloud droplet nuclei, increasing the number of droplets within the cloud and reducing the mean radius of cloud droplets. This redistribution of water vapor leads to larger, brighter, and longer-lasting clouds that reflect more incoming sunlight. As a result, ACI offsets a fraction of the warming caused by rising CO2 levels.\n\nHowever, the strength of the ACI effect varies depending on the local environment, making it challenging to model accurately. Current climate models can only approximate ACI using low spatial resolution and limited parameterizations, often relying on a few environmental parameters such as relative humidity.\n\nState-of-the-art climate models estimate that ACI may offset 0-50% of the warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. To improve our understanding of ACI, this work uses causal machine learning to estimate the effect of aerosol on clouds from satellite observations. We reframed the problem as a treatment (aerosol) and outcome (change in droplet radius) and predicted the causal effect of aerosol on clouds with uncertainty bounds.\n\nWe considered two types of uncertainty: positivity violations and unconfoundedness. Positivity violations occur when the data does not represent all treatment levels, while unconfoundedness refers to unobserved factors that influence both the treatment and outcomes. To address these uncertainties, we used Overcast, a method that provides uncertainty-aware sensitivity analysis.\n\nWe evaluated three climate models and found that only one plausibly recreated the trend, lending more credence to its estimate of cooling due to ACI. Our results provide a more accurate estimate of the causal effect of aerosol on clouds and highlight the importance of considering uncertainty in climate modeling.\n\nThe methods used in this work are based on the potential outcomes framework, which estimates the effect of a continuous treatment (aerosol) on outcomes of interest (cloud property) for a unit described by covariates (environmental information). We considered relative humidity, sea surface temperature, vertical motion, lower tropospheric stability, and effective inversion strength as covariates. The treatment is aerosol optical depth (AOD), a proxy for aerosol concentration, and the outcome is cloud droplet size.\n\nWe estimated the treatment-effect using the conditional average potential outcome (CAPO) and the average potential outcome (APO), which can be identified from the observational distribution. Our results provide a more accurate estimate of the causal effect of aerosol on clouds and highlight the importance of considering uncertainty in climate modeling."
