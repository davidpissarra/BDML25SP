As a result of climate change, ﬁre events are becoming more frequent and severe, with meteorological conditions of high ignition propensity being more frequently met, leading to increased ﬁre spotting, and rapid spread. In addition, these conditions are veriﬁed over longer periods, extending ﬁre seasons in several regions worldwide. To prevent and mitigate the devastating effects of wildﬁre events, it becomes urgent to detect ﬁres in an early stage and to monitor wildﬁres in near-real-time as the events unravel, providing enhanced situational awareness for decision-making and operational teams. In that sense, wildﬁre intelligence plays a pivotal role, especially for high-risk areas such as wildland-urban-interface regions [ 2] and large-scale wildﬁres [ 3]. For these reasons, there is a current demand for improvements and increased levels of automation in the stages of pre-ﬁre event, ﬁreﬁghting, and aftermath. In this context, the breakthroughs in machine learning (ML) can be an enabling technology towards the integration of artiﬁcial intelligence products in current decision support systems. More speciﬁcally, related works have proposed ML solutions for image-based ﬁre detection tasks [ 4,5], however the quality and limited size of image databases available often do not offer generalization guarantees for reliable deployments in real contexts [ 6]. Although transfer learning and data augmentation techniques have been explored in related work, the limitations in interpretability and transparency of black-box models prevent effectively ﬁne-tuning these models to solve existing shortcomings [ 6]. The lack of large-scale databases for wildﬁre detection and monitoring tasks is a known hurdle in developing machine learning algorithms with adequate generalization. \u0003Corresponding author.
