As a result, they obtain good performance for a few majority classes but poor performance for many minority classes. We used two-phase training to increase the performance for these minority classes. We trained, next to a baseline model, four models that implemented a different versions of two-phase training on a subset of the highly imbalanced Snapshot Serengeti dataset. Our results suggest that two-phase training can improve performance for many minority classes, with limited loss in performance for the other classes. We ﬁnd that two-phase training based on majority undersampling increases class-speciﬁc F1-scores up to 3.0%. We also ﬁnd that two-phase training outperforms using only oversampling or undersampling by 6.1% in F1-score on average. Finally, we ﬁnd that a combination of over- and undersampling leads to a better performance than using them individually. 1 Introduction A recent report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) conﬁrms that biodiversity and ecosystems are deteriorating worldwide [ 1]. Population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles and ﬁsh have decreased by an average of 68% between 1970 and 2016 across the world. This decrease in biodiversity has several causes, such as habitat loss due to pollution, species overexploitation or climate change. Biodiversity is important since it is a key indicator of overall healthy ecosystems which in their turn have important social and economic consequences for humans. In particular, biodiversity and ecosystems inﬂuence our water quality, air quality and climate, they secure our food production and impact the spread of infectious diseases originating from animals [1, 5]. Machine learning (ML) can help to more efﬁciently measure and monitor the well-being of ecosystems and the success of biodiversity conservation efforts [ 14,16,35,25]. As an example, this paper proposes a method for automatic classiﬁcation of camera trap images, a type of motion triggered cameras used in biological studies to estimate animal population density and activity patterns [ 26, \u0003Joint ﬁrst author. yCorresponding author. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.7,27,29,32,34]. Since manually labeling large numbers of camera trap images is time consuming and costly [ 17], ML could be used to automatically detect animals and the species to which they belong in images. This work uses Convolutional Neural Networks [ 18,19] to classify camera trap images. Training a CNN on a dataset of camera trap images is challenging, because camera trap images often only depict a part of an animal, because of high intra-class variation due to differences in backgrounds, and because the class-distribution of camera trap datasets is typically highly imbalanced. This imbalance is inherent to camera trap datasets since it reﬂects the imbalance of ecosystems [ 33], and it results in biased classiﬁers that perform very well for a few majority classes but poorly for many minority classes. Classiﬁers that perform well on all classes would be of more value to ecologists, and moreover, rare or less observed animal species might even be of special interest to research. Therefore, solutions are needed to mitigate this imbalance when classifying camera trap images. To this end, we use a two-phase training method [ 20] to mitigate class imbalance, for the ﬁrst time to the best of our knowledge on camera trap images. In experiments we compare it to different data-level class imbalance mitigation techniques, and show that it improves performance on minority classes, with limited loss in performance for other classes, resulting in an increase in macro F1-score. 2 Related work Pioneering studies that automatically classiﬁed camera trap images relied on manual feature extraction and smaller datasets [ 6,31,39,4]. Better and more scalable results were later achieved with deep CNNs and larger datasets [ 8,24,32,38,28]. Generally, models trained by these scholars achieve accuracies well above 90%, but the models are biased towards majority classes, which severely affects their class-speciﬁc performance. Especially the performance for rare species is poor. Scholars dealt with this challenge by removing the rare classes from the dataset [ 8,38], with conﬁdence thresholding and letting experts review the uncertain classiﬁcations [ 38], with weighted losses, oversampling and emphasis sampling [ 24] or by using a combination of additional image augmentations for rare classes and novel sampling techniques [ 28]. Although [ 24] managed to greatly increase the accuracy for a few rare classes using oversampling, none of the aforementioned techniques systematically improved accuracy for most of the rare species.

To address this issue, we employed two-phase training to improve performance on minority classes.

Specifically, we found that two-phase training based on majority undersampling increased class-specific F1-scores by up to 3.0%.

Furthermore, we found that combining over- and undersampling led to better performance than using them individually.\n\nIntroduction\n\nA recent report by the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) confirms that biodiversity and ecosystems are deteriorating worldwide. The population sizes of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, and fish have decreased by an average of 68% between 1970 and 2016 across the world. This decline in biodiversity has several causes, including habitat loss due to pollution, species overexploitation, and climate change. Biodiversity is crucial because it is a key indicator of overall healthy ecosystems, which have significant social and economic consequences for humans. In particular, biodiversity and ecosystems influence our water quality, air quality, and climate, and they secure our food production and impact the spread of infectious diseases originating from animals.\n\nMachine learning (ML) can help to more efficiently measure and monitor the well-being of ecosystems and the success of biodiversity conservation efforts. For example, this paper proposes a method for automatic classification of camera trap images, a type of motion-activated camera used in biological studies to estimate animal population density and activity patterns. Since manually labeling large numbers of camera trap images is time-consuming and costly, ML can be used to automatically detect animals and the species to which they belong in images. This work uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify camera trap images. Training a CNN on a dataset of camera trap images is challenging due to the high intra-class variation caused by differences in backgrounds and the class distribution of camera trap datasets, which is typically highly imbalanced.\n\nThis imbalance is inherent to camera trap datasets, reflecting the imbalance of ecosystems, and results in biased classifiers that perform well for a few majority classes but poorly for many minority classes. Classifiers that perform well on all classes would be more valuable to ecologists, and rare or less observed animal species might be of special interest to researchers. Therefore, solutions are needed to mitigate this imbalance when classifying camera trap images. To this end, we use a two-phase training method to mitigate class imbalance, which we apply for the first time to camera trap images in this study. In experiments, we compare it to different data-level class imbalance mitigation techniques and show that it improves performance on minority classes with limited loss in performance for other classes, resulting in an increase in macro F1-score.\n\nRelated work\n\nPioneering studies that automatically classified camera trap images relied on manual feature extraction and smaller datasets.
