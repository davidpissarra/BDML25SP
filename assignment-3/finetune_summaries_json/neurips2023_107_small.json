Using the sensor data, we preserve underlying causal relations among sensor attributes and organic matter. Simultaneously we leverage inherent structure in the data and train the model to discriminate among domains using contrastive learning. This causal and contrastive constraint minimization ensures improved generalization and adaptation to other domains. We also shed light on the interpretability of the framework by identifying attributes that are important for improving generalization. Identifying these key soil attributes that affect organic matter will aid in efforts to standardize data collection efforts. 1 Introduction Background Measuring and monitoring soil organic matter (OM) is pivotal in fighting against climate change [6]. Apart from contributing to improving soil health, organic matter has several co-benefits - such as fighting against soil erosion and preserving the water table [2, 5, 9]. These characteristics make it imperative to preserve organic matter, especially in regions that are becoming vulnerable to droughts and landslides as the climate changes. While monitoring OM is an important problem, sampling and measuring OM (and other soil attributes) is expensive (e.g., the average cost of soil testing in the US is $1444) [23]. Furthermore, to ensure accurate and reliable measurement of soil properties, it is necessary to conduct sampling at intervals of every tens of meters [3]. Related Work Alternatively, insights about OM can be inferred from other soil characteristics and remote sensing information using data-driven ML methods [8, 11, 22, 24, 13, 15, 4, 17, 19, 7, 20]. While sensor data input offers high-fidelity insights and captures the variability in the dominant soil processes in the region, collecting data from sensors is expensive. On the other hand, remote sensing data is inexpensive and widely available for different parts of the world. Notably, while remote sensing data are underutilized in low-income regions, the benefits derived from use of remote sensing will be the most in these regions where the effect of climate change is prominent[12]. However, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Domain Adaptation framework for Organic Matter Modeling using Causal and Contrastive Constraint Minimization. Conditioning the satellite image embedding using soil attribute embeddings provides additional context or guidance on how the underlying soil properties impact OM. insights from remote sensing data may be biased due to noise and coarse-scale resolution [1, 10, 26]. In the context of OM mapping, domain adaptation has been useful in overcoming some of the challenges due to remote sensing data and in adapting models to differing land types and countries [16, 21]. While these studies use local soil information as input variables, which may be costly to collect, the studies conclude that domain adaptation helps in improving the generalization to other domains or regions. Summary of Contributions We propose a scalable and generalizable domain adaptation framework for mitigating bias from remote sensing data using sparse sensor data as auxiliary data. Even if sensor data is not available during inference, leveraging sensor data while training can help capture the variability in the underlying soil processes and improve the generalization of the framework. Such a framework can be built on data-rich entities and be transferred to unobserved entities without further fine-tuning. Conventional ML methods overlook the underlying causal structure in the data, limiting their out-of-distribution generalization. To overcome this, we propose the use of causal constraint minimization to ensure that the relation between the sensor data attributes and OM is preserved in the posterior OM distribution across different regions. Traditional ML methods also struggle with generalization to locations with unobserved drivers (no training data). We leverage the spatial heterogeneity in the sensor attributes to improve generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) locations by influencing embeddings via contrastive learning. Our analysis is also able to identify key soil attributes that affect organic matter, potentially improving understanding of how to optimize soil management practices and standardize data collection approaches. 2 Methods Thebackbone model is a CNN autoencoder (Fig. 7) that estimates OM from satellite imagery data (more details in Appendix). Although this model uses satellite imagery input, which is more readily available and captures information about changing soil properties, vegetation, and climate, leveraging soil attributes can help distill the important signals from the images and improve the encodings learned by the autoencoder framework. To achieve this, we propose incorporating two regularization schemes - causal constraint minimization and contrastive learning. Causally adaptive constraint minimization (CACM) has been implemented to improve generalization under distributional shifts in computer vision benchmark datasets [18]. The method utilizes different independence constraints based on how attributes in training data relate to response variables. These constraints are incorporated in the loss function to regularize the training by adaptively enforcing the correct independence constraints. We extend the causal constraint minimization framework to a setting with continuous attributes and continuous response variable on real-world dataset. We modify the framework to incorporate regularization\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
