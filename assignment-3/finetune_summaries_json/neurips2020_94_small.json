These deﬁciencies make the impacts of aerosols one of the highest sources of uncertainty in global climate change modelling, and associated impacts on weather and human health. We propose to use Machine Learning methods to overcome the challenges in modelling aerosol nucleation and growth, by ingesting the data from the multitude of available sources to create a single parameterisation applicable throughout the modelled atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere at all latitudes) that efﬁciently encompasses all input ambient conditions and concentrations of relevant species. 1 Introduction Clouds and aerosols continue to contribute the largest uncertainty to estimates and interpretations of the Earth’s changing energy budget [ 26]. Atmospheric aerosols have direct and indirect effects on Earth’s climate and impacts on public health [ 10]. Aerosols originate from several natural and anthropogenic sources. New particle formation (NPF), the gas-to-particle conversion of atmospheric vapours, is a major source of secondary aerosols that can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and further affect the climate [ 25]. NPF has been observed in boreal forests, coastal, agricultural, and urban areas, including polluted megacities [ 16,17,15,6]. NPF in the atmosphere profoundly affects climate, weather, air quality, and human health. It is the ﬁrst step of the complex process leading to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) formation. It is estimated that about 40–70% of CCN globally originate from NPF [20, 30]. Even though there is a wealth of observations from ﬁeld measurements (in forests, high-altitude, polar regions, coastal and urban sites, aircraft campaigns) [ 2,9,1,3], as well as laboratory studies of multi-component nucleation (including the CLOUD chamber at CERN) [ 11,12,19], and improved nucleation theories, there is still limited understanding and the NPF parameterisations in regional and global models of the atmosphere are lacking. These deﬁciencies make the impacts of aerosols the highest source of uncertainty in modelling global climate change (IPCC), and associated impacts on weather and human health. Understanding NPF is imperative to reduce uncertainties in climate projections and to tackle urban air quality problems. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.In large-scale models of the atmosphere, which consider aerosol dynamics to project climate change, it is necessary to use parameterised nucleation rates for computational efﬁciency. Presently, atmospheric models rely on simple parameterisations that are typically polynomial ﬁts to the dependency of measured NPF rates as a function of vapour concentration (and airborne ions) and are only valid for the environments and conditions that match each observation site [ 4]. To date, measurements contribute to disparate parameterisations with limited spatial applicability, even though they relate to the same physical processes. More detailed theoretical models including additional species (e.g. nano-Köhler theory [ 14]) were also shown to have limitations and are too computationally expensive to be incorporated into high-resolution models of the atmosphere and climate. A consistent parameterisation in the scope of atmospheric modelling, with predictive capacity and computational efﬁciency, has so far proven to be elusive. The introduction of machine learning methods in this ﬁeld is limited to using random forest regression of atmospheric model data to a-posteriori derive measured CCN [ 22], and automating the manual process of observed event identiﬁcation based only on particle size distributions [8], with no inference or additional insights. We propose to instead use state-of-the-art data science methods to combine all available measure- ments of NPF and growth, and associated (vapour concentrations, presence of ions, meteorological conditions) from the multitide of souces (Sec. 2) into a single hyper-parameter model that can provide consistent (at all altitudes and environments/latitudes) and efﬁcient (once trained, the computational load of inference permits to be incorporated in GCMs) NPF simulation. Machine Learning methods can overcome the challenges in simulating aerosol nucleation and growth by ingesting the data from the multitude of available sources to create a single parameterisation applicable throughout the atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere) that efﬁciently encompasses all ambient conditions and concentrations of relevant species. At the same time, we can gain insight into the physical processes undeprinning NPF and growth and the complex interaction of the different components. Such insights can drive further research, e.g., by guiding future observation campaigns. 2 Data Aggregation Measurement campaigns of N\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
