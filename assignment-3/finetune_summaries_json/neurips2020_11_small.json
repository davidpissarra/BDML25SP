Fossil fuel power plants account for 30% of GHG emissions [ 1] or an estimated 15 billion tons of CO 2per year [ 2]. These eighteen thousand or so fossil fuel burning plants [ 3] meet 85% of global electricity demand [ 4]. As renewable energy becomes more economical, fossil fuel power is decreasing in many parts of the world [ 5], but new plants are still being built in others, especially in China and India [ 6]. Coal-ﬁred power plants are the single largest emitter of CO 2 worldwide [2]. Averting the most severe impacts of climate change requires understanding the sources of emissions – which power plants and how much they emit. The United States is one of the few countries that publicly releases high-time-resolution data on emissions from individual power plants. Every major US plant has on-site Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) and reports data to the Environmental Protection Agency. But the costs of installing and maintaining these systems make them impractical for use in many countries. In addition, monitoring systems can be tampered with or suffer technical failures. Other countries report annual emissions totals that may be rough estimates instead of actual measurements and lack veriﬁcation [7]. Policymakers, scientists, and companies need granular and reliable data to design sustainability strategies. To that end, we are building a system to estimate the emissions of every power plant in the world using remote sensing data from existing satellites. We have developed machine learning models for predicting whether a plant is on or off from a single image and tested them on two different satellite constellations. This paper describes our models and analyzes their performance. Emissions estimates from this project will be made public. While use cases are still being explored, we anticipate a number of possible opportunities. Renewable energy developers can use the data to pinpoint locations where new wind or solar farms will have the most impact. Regulatory agencies Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020can create and enforce new environmental policy. Individual citizens can see how much their local power plants are contributing to climate change. Finally, NGOs can track progress toward the Paris Climate Agreement, which will be renegotiated at COP26 in 2021. Our project is part of a larger initiative called Climate TRACE (Tracking Real-time Atmospheric Carbon Emissions) that aims to track human-emitted GHGs from all sectors – from electricity to heavy industry to shipping [8]. 2 Background Concentrations of CO 2in the atmosphere are measured locally at observatories such as Mauna Loa (producing the well-known Keeling Curve [ 9]). They are also measured globally by two satellite missions: the Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) and the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT). These satellites use spectroscopic methods based on the absorption of reﬂected sunlight to estimate the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction of CO 2, known as XCO 2. Several researchers have used XCO 2to try to estimate emissions from individual sources such as fossil fuel power plants [ 10–15]. However, this is difﬁcult because GHG concentrations are also affected by natural sources such as CO 2and methane releases from the ocean, volcanoes, biomass decomposition, and soil, plant, and animal respiration. This background noise makes it difﬁcult to detect changes in concentration due to anthropogenic sources such as burning fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) and industrial processes (e.g. cement production and iron smelting). Anthropogenic sources also ﬂuctuate depending on local demand and fuel prices, among other factors. A second challenge is distinguishing emissions sources that are close together. For example, each measurement from OCO-2 represents a one square mile area on the ground, which is too coarse for differentiating many emissions sources. The dispersal of emitted CO 2by wind also complicates this situation. New satellite data with better spatial and temporal resolution of CO 2concentrations may eventually become available [16, 17].\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
