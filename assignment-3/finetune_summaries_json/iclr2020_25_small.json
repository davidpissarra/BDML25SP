Recent work leverages weak supervision to alleviate the problem of labeled data scarcity. How- ever, the deﬁnition of weak supervision signals is limited by the existence of mil- lions of possible heuristic-based feature generation rules. Furthermore these rules are often difﬁcult to interpret for climate ﬁnance and underperform in critical data subsets. We propose Xingu, an interpretable MRV system to explain weak su- pervision rules using game-theoretic SHAP values for critical model predictions. Moreover Xingu enables domain experts to collectively design and share labeling functions, thus curating a reusable knowledge base for weak supervision signals. 1 I NTRODUCTION Humanity is facing an unprecedented climate crisis and decisive action is required to tackle global warming. Land use and land use change (LULUC) play a critical role in our climate, taking up about a quarter of annual anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) during 2007-2016 (IPCC (2019)). In addition to being a key driver of global warming, careless land use is also destroying valuable ecosystem services and is threatening the livelihood for local populations and a multitude of species. Multiple climate ﬁnance instruments have been established to reward landowners for sustainable land use REDD+, Payment for Ecosystem Services and biodiversity banking (D ´ıaz et al. (2015)). A key task of global climate ﬁnance is the Monitoring, Reporting and Veriﬁcation (MRV) of global change in land use, forests and biodiversity (Dao et al. (2019a)). Aircraft- or satellite-based MRV is crucial for the decision making of stakeholders such as government agencies and private climate investors. Machine learning approaches have shown to be effective to automatically perform MRV- tasks, but are limited by a lack of task-speciﬁc labels. Due to this lack of available labeled data, recent work has thus been focusing instead on leveraging weak supervision to generate training data via labeling functions (Ratner et al. (2016), Dao et al. (2019b)). However, weak supervision systems are facing a multitude of challenges that make decision making within climate ﬁnance difﬁcult: 1. The enormous availability of geospatial data is restricting domain experts in building strong labeling rules. For instance, Google’s Earth Engine data catalog provides 376 datasets (as of January 2020), each providing multiple possible bands. Facing millions of possible combinations and preprocessing rules, domain experts struggle to select and design the right weak label generators. 2. Being able to interpret model predictions is an important requirement for transparent and fair decision making in climate ﬁnance. However outcomes from an MRV system trained \u0003Authors have contributed equally. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Figure 1: Local explanations of labeling functions. In data programming, labeling functions are used to estimate a generative model in order to predict probabilistic labels. Surprisingly, on the same time geospatial labeling functions can also be represented as ternary feature maps. Thus the role and relationship of labeling functions towards a prediction on labeled critical data subsets can be approximately explained using their corresponding SHAP values. with weak supervision are difﬁcult to explain. Especially the role of labeling functions in data programming predictions is not well understood. 3. Especially critical outcomes for climate ﬁnance (e.g selective logging or mining in LU- LUC) correspond to, often rare, data subsets or slices (Chen et al. (2019)). While MRV models that leverage weak supervision can achieve overall high accuracy, they may under- perform on critical subsets due to lack of slice-speciﬁc training data. 4. Weak supervision approaches that are constrained to the image domain are often unable to incorporate highly informative location-speciﬁc, socio-economic or political data. For instance, weak supervision such as night lights (Jean et al. (2016)) or Doc2Vec represen- tations extracted from geotagged Wikipedia articles (Sheehan et al. (2018)) can be used as features for socio-economic growth prediction. We propose Xingu: An interpretable automated MRV system that addresses the aforementioned issues with respect to feature design and transparency issues in climate ﬁnance: 1. Xingu enables domain experts to design and share labeling functions for speciﬁc tasks. Understanding the role of labeling functions of a certain task then allows us to recommend these functions for novel but similar tasks. 2. Xingu incorporates SHAP (Lundberg & Lee (2017)), a method that allows measurement of feature-importance on a given dataset. As such, features can be scored and interpreted in terms of their usefulness. All labeling functions that are used in our system are deﬁned as ternary maps (corresponding to yes,no,abstain ).
