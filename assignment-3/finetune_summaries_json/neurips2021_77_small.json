Recent studies using cGPS data have established a link between transient deformation within earth’s crust to climate variables. DeepQuake’s physics-based pre-processing algorithm extracts relevant features including the \u000fx,\u000fy, and\u000fxycomponents of strain in earth’s crust, capturing earth’s elastic response to these climate variables, and feeds it into a deep learning neural network to predict key earthquake variables such as the time, location, magnitude, and depth of a future earthquake. Results across California show promising correlations between cGPS derived strain patterns and the earthquake catalog ground truth for a given location and time. 1 Introduction Every year, around 20,000 earthquakes occur worldwide [1]. In the last 20 years, earthquakes have caused around 750,000 deaths and have displaced over 125 million people [1]. Earthquakes are particularly catastrophic as they usually occur without much warning, leaving little time for precautionary measures. In addition, earthquakes often trigger other natural hazards such as tsunamis and landslides which can lead to downstream accidents damaging the environment. For example, the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in Japan was triggered by an earthquake leading to a tsunami that caused uncontrolled release of radioactive material contaminating hundreds of thousands of litres of water, resulting in measurable exposure of marine organisms in the Paciﬁc Ocean [2]. The causal relationship between climate and earthquakes is becoming increasingly clear in recent years. Recent studies [3] have established that climate variables such as seasonal precipitation, temperature gradients, and atmospheric pressure can cause deformations within Earth’s crust, leading to earthquakes. The seasonal peak-to-peak amplitudes of vertical movements can be explained by the solid Earth’s elastic response to the surface load from the precipitation patterns. For example, as California typically has wet winters, the extra hydrologic load leads to the lowest vertical heights of the elastic crust while due to the loss of surface loads during the dryer summer months, the crust typically reaches the highest vertical point. In this work, we utilize cGPS measurements, operated by the NSF’s GAGE Facility at UNA VCO, that detect seasonally driven transient deformations within the plate boundary zone regions. By inverting the cGPS data, we quantify horizontal strain which is fed to a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) based model called DeepQuake to provide ﬁne-grained earthquake forecasts. Initial results across California, including the Napa Valley and Long Valley Caldera regions, show signiﬁcant correlations between cGPS derived strain patterns and earthquake catalog ground truth to predict the magnitude and depth of earthquake for a given location and time. 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Vancouver, Canada.2 Previous Work Since the end of 19th century, seismic researchers have tried to identify predictors of earthquakes such as foreshocks, changes in groundwater, or unusual animal behavior without much success.
