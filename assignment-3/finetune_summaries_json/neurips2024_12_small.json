Interpretation with Integrated Gradients reveals consistent spatial patterns, suggesting ViTs utilize physically grounded signals. This work highlights ViTs’ potential to advance climate change detection and attribution tasks. 1 Introduction Understanding the drivers behind climate change is essential for developing accurate climate projec- tions and shaping effective policies. At the heart of this endeavor is the Detection and Attribution (D&A) of climate change signals, a process focused on distinguishing the signals of human-induced warming from the inherently noisy patterns of natural climate variability. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has highlighted the critical importance of accurately identifying these anthropogenic influences to inform targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies effectively [ 1]. Objective. This paper explores the application of advanced artificial intelligence models, specifically Vision Transformers (ViTs), to extend the ongoing efforts of climate change Detection and Attribution (D&A) studies. Considering that climate fields are globally interconnected spatially, we hypothesize that the global attention mechanism of ViTs could significantly improve D&A models. This approach is particularly promising given the recent successes of MLPs and CNNs in similar tasks. Related Work. Traditional approaches in climate Detection and Attribution (D&A) have largely relied on statistical methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify spatial fingerprints from long-term climate records, indicative of external forcings like greenhouse gas emissions [ 2–4]. Recent advancements have seen a shift towards incorporating machine learning techniques, including ridge regression, Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), adept at detecting climate change signals even in daily weather snapshots [5–8]. 2 Dataset and Methods 2.1 Dataset To train our climate change detection models, we used global climate model outputs from CMIP6 archive. For evaluation on observation records, we utilized three modern reanalysis products. ∗sungduk.yu@intel.com Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.CMIP6. CMIP6 is a globally coordinated climate modeling initiative, featuring over 100 models from more than 50 research groups [ 9]. It encompasses historical simulations covering 1850 to 2014, along with ScenarioMIP projections extending from 2015 to 2100 under diverse socioeconomic pathways, thereby offering a comprehensive dataset for climate research. For model training, we utilize the ClimDetect dataset [ 10], a dataset curated from CMIP6 specifically designed for climate change detection tasks, covering the period of 1950-2100. For the hypothesis testing, we prepare an independent (that is, not used in model training) CMIP6 dataset for 1850-1949 for estimating natural variability. It comprises the same 7 climate models included in the ClimDetect test set. Reanalysis. Reanalysis datasets synthesize observations with model outputs to create continuous, globally comprehensive climate records, offering a more consistent alternative to sparse observational data alone. We use three modern reanalysis dataset that serves as the closest alternative to direct observations where continuous data coverage is required for robust model evaluation and hypothesis testing: ERA5 (data span: 1940-present) [ 11], JRA-3Q (1950-present) [ 12], and MERRA2 (1980- present) [13]. In the context of our study, ‘observations’ refers to reanalysis datasets. 2.2 Climate Change Detection Our method builds on Sippel et al (2020) [ 7], but distinguishes itself by employing modern AI architectures instead of traditional ridge regression models. For a visual illustration, see Figure S1. Step 1: Climate Change Detection Model Training. Detection models in most prior studies focus on extracting ‘fingerprints’—spatial patterns anticipated to emerge due to external forcings such as greenhouse gas emissions. With the application of nonlinear machine learning models, these ‘fingerprints’ are reinterpreted as complex nonlinear functions. These models are trained to discern anthropogenic climate signals from the natural variability present in daily climate data. Specifically, these functions ( Fθ) are trained on the CMIP6 dataset to map input daily climate fields ( X) to a annual scalar target variable ( y), a key climate change indicator, establishing a model for climate change signal detection, i.e., y=Fθ(X)2. Step 2: Hypothesis Testing. The null hypothesis posits that the predicted test statistic falls within the range expected under natural variability. We estimate the distribution of natural variability, P(yhist) =P(Fθ(Xhist)), by predicting test statistics from the historical (“pre-warming”) CMIP6 dataset for the period 1850–1949. Then, we apply the trained model to reanalysis datasets to obtain observed test statistics yobs=Fθ(Xobs). Finally, we test the null hypothesis by assessing if yobsis distinguishable from the estimated natural variability, e.g., 2.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
