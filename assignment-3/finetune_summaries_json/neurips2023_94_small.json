An evolutionary search process can then be used to discover effective land-use policies for specific locations. Such a system was built on the Project Resilience platform [ 5] and evaluated with the Land-Use Harmonization dataset [ 4] and the BLUE simulator [ 3]. It generates Pareto fronts that trade off carbon impact and amount of change customized to different locations, thus providing a potentially useful tool for land-use planning. 1 Introduction One of the main factors contributing to climate change is how much land area is allocated for different uses [ 2]. Forests in general absorb more carbon than e.g. crops and ranges, yet such uses are essential for the economy. Land-use patterns must therefore be planned to maximize carbon absorption while maintaining economic viability. An approach for land-use optimization was developed as part of Project Resilience, a non-profit project hosted by the ITU agency of the United Nations [5]. The goal is to provide decision-makers with a tool to know how their land-use choices affect CO2 fluxes in the long term, and make suggestions for optimizing these choices. More specifically, the tool is designed to answer three questions: (1) For a geographical grid cell, identified by its latitude and longitude, what changes to the land usage can be made to reduce CO2 emissions? (2) What will be the long-term CO2 impact of changing land usage in a particular way? (3) What are the optimal land-use choices that can be made with minimal cost and maximal effect? The approach is based on the Evolutionary Surrogate-assisted Prescription method [ 1]. The idea is to first utilize historical data to learn a surrogate model on how land-use decisions in different contexts affect carbon emissions. Then, this model is used to evaluate candidates in an evolutionary search process for good land-use change policies. As a result, a Pareto front is generated of solutions that trade off reduction in carbon emissions and the amount of change in land use. Each point in the Pareto front represents an optimal policy for that tradeoff. To make the results trustworthy, the tool allows the decision-maker to explore modifications to these policies, and see the expected effect. In the future, it should also be possible to evaluate confidence of the predictions, evolve rule sets to make the policies explainable, and utilize ensembling and further objectives and preferences to make them more accurate. Thus, the tool harnesses several techniques in machine learning to provide a practical tool for decision-makers in optimizing land-use decisions. This paper provides a short summary; for details, see the full paper [ 7]. An interactive demo of the system is at https://landuse.evolution.ml. 2 Background Evolutionary Surrogate-assisted Prescription (ESP; [ 1]) is an approach for optimizing decision- making in a variety of domains (Figure 1). The main idea is that a decision policy can be represented as a neural network, or a set of rules, and a good policy can be discovered through population-based search, i.e. using evolutionary computation techniques. However, each Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: The ESP Decision Optimiza- tion Method. A predictor is trained with historical data on how given actions in given contexts led to specific outcomes. It is then used as a surrogate in order to evolve prescriptors, i.e. neural networks that implement decision policies result- ing in the best possible outcomes.candidate must be evaluated, which is difficult to do in many real-world applications. Therefore, a surrogate model of the world is learned from historical data, predict- ing how good the resulting outcomes are for each decision in each context. ESP was first evaluated in reinforcement learning tasks such as function approximation, cart-pole control, and the flappybird game, and found to discover significantly better solutions, find them faster, and with lower regret than standard approaches such as direct evolution, DQN, and PPO. A major application to decision-making was de- veloped for optimizing strategies for non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in the COVID-19 pandemic [ 6]. This approach was extended to an XPRIZE competition on Pan- demic Response, which in turn forms the blueprint for Project Resilience [ 5], an ITU/UN collaborative effort to tackle global problems. Land-use optimization is the first application being developed under Project Resilience. 3 Land-Use Optimization Task The data for carbon emissions (Emissions resulting from Land-Use Change, ELUC) originate from a high-fidelity simulation called Bookkeeping of Land-Use Emissions (BLUE; [ 3]). BLUE is designed to estimate the long-term CO2 impact of committed land use. “Committed emissions” means all the emissions that are caused by a land-use change event are attributed to the year of the event.
