This outperforms previous methods in classifying the drivers and predicting the segmentation map of deforestation, offering a 9% improvement in classiﬁcation accuracy and a 7% improvement in segmentation map accuracy. In addition, this method predicts stable segmentation maps under rotation of the input image, which ensures that predicted regions of deforestation are not dependent upon the rotational orientation of the satellite. 1 Introduction Deforestation has been greatly accelerated by human activities with many drivers leading to a loss of forest area. Deforestation has a negative impact on natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change and it is becoming a force of global importance (Foley et al., 2005). Deforestation for palm plantations is projected to contribute 18-22% of Indonesia’s CO 2-equivalent emissions (Carlson et al., 2013). Furthermore, deforestation in the tropics contributes roughly 10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions (Arneth et al., 2019). In addition, over one quarter of global forest loss is due to deforestation with the land being permanently changes to be used for the production of commodities, including beef, soy, palm oil, and wood ﬁber (Curtis et al., 2018). Climate tipping points are when a small change in forcing, triggers a strongly nonlinear response in the internal dynamics of part of the climate system (Lenton, 2011). Deforestation is one of the contributors that can cause climate tipping points (Lenton, 2011). Therefore, understanding the drivers for deforestation is of signiﬁcant importance. The availability and advances in high-resolution satellite imaging have enabled applications in mapping to develop at scale (Roy et al., 2014; Verpoorter et al., 2012, 2014; Janowicz et al., 2020; Karpatne et al., 2018). A range of prior works have used decision trees, random forest classiﬁers, and convolutional neural networks for the task of classifying and mapping deforestation drivers (Phiri et al., 2019; Descals et al., 2019; Poortinga et al., 2019; Hethcoat et al., 2019; Sylvain et al., 2019; Irvin et al., 2020). However none of these previous methods leverage advances in group equivariant convolutional networks (Cohen & Welling, 2016a,b; Weiler & Cesa, 2019) and as such the methods are not stable with respect to transformations that would naturally occur during the capture of such data. \u0003https://github.com/JoshuaMitton/Rotation-Equivariant-Deforestation-Segmentation 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.In this work we train models to classify drivers of deforestation and generate a segmentation map of the deforestation area. For this we build a convolutional and group equivariant convolutional model to assess the impact on classiﬁcation accuracy and both segmentation accuracy and stability of the segmentation maps produced. We show that not only does the group equivariant model, with translation and rotation equivariant convolutions, improve classiﬁcation and segmentation accuracy, but it has the desired property of stability of the segmentation map under natural transformations of the data capture method, namely rotations of the satellite imaging. 2 Equivariance (a) Rotation invariant features  (b) Rotation equivariant features. Figure 1: An image is rotated by gusing\u0019(g), where\u0019is some transformation law and gis any angle of rotation. The ﬁlters, \t, of the layer produce some output features, here a single ﬁber is shown. The representation \u001a(g)speciﬁes how the feature vectors transform. (a) The representation \u001a0is the trivial representation, where \u001a0(g) = 1 8g2G. This is used for scalar features that do not change under rotation, for example, The three RGB channels of an image are each a scalar feature and they do not mix under rotation. Therefore, typically, the input representation is the direct sum,L3 i=11 = id 3\u00023, of three trivial representations. (b) The representation \u001a1is here used to represent the regular representation, where \u001a1(g) =g8g2G. In this example the image is rotated by 90\u000ewhich corresponds to a cyclic shift of the features in the output ﬁber. A CNN is, in general, comprised of multiple convolutional layers, alongside other layers. These convolutional layers are translation equivariant. This means that if the input signal is translated, the resulting output feature map is translated accordingly. Translation equivariance is a useful inductive bias to build into a model for image\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This has a negative impact on natural ecosystems, biodiversity, and climate change, making it a global concern. Deforestation for palm plantations is projected to contribute 18-22% of Indonesia's CO2-equivalent emissions.
