Accurately reconstruct- ing the breathless ocean is crucial for assessing and protecting marine ecosystem in response to climate change. Existing expert-dominated numerical simulations fail to catch up with the dynamic variation caused by global warming and human activities. Besides, due to the high-cost data collection, the historical observa- tions are severely sparse, leading to big challenge for precise reconstruction. In this work, we propose O XYGENERATOR, the first spatio-temporal graph learning model, to reconstruct the global ocean deoxygenation from 1920 to 2023. Specif- ically, to address the heterogeneity across large temporal and spatial scales, we propose zoning-varying graph message-passing to capture the complex oceano- graphic correlations between missing values and sparse observations. Addition- ally, to further calibrate the uncertainty, we incorporate inductive bias from dis- solved oxygen (DO) variations and chemical effects. Compared with in-situ DO observations, O XYGENERATOR significantly outperforms CMIP6 numerical sim- ulations, reducing MAPE by 38.77%, demonstrating a promising potential to un- derstand the ocean deoxygenation in data-driven manner. 1 I NTRODUCTION Oxygen is fundamentally essential for all life. Unfortunately, recent research Schmidtko et al. (2017) has shown that the concentration of dissolved oxygen (DO) in the ocean has been steadily decreasing over the past 50 years, indicating the acceleration of global ocean deoxygenation. To quantitatively understand and predict the long-term trend of global ocean deoxygenation, oceanographers simulate the DO concentration based on climate models without utilizing in-situ DO observations. Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) Eyring et al. (2016), a world-wide simulation com- pasrion project, includes different numerical simulation over a century. However, these models are unable to adjust for DO simulation biases caused by global warming and human activities, leading to error propagation and showing large discrepancies with in-situ observations. In recent years, with the advancement of ocean observation technologies and international ocean discovery programs, a lot of in-situ observation data has been accumulated. However, the long-term historical observations of DO is severely sparse due to the high-cost and high-risk marine scientific expeditions. For example, the World Ocean Database (WOD) Boyer et al. (2018) is world’s largest and widely-used collection of publicly available ocean profile data1, and we are extremely surprised to find that more than 96.265% DO observation data are missing in the past 100 years. Therefore, this suggests the following Question: Can deep learning methods more accurately reconstruct global ocean deoxygenation over a century under sparse dissolved oxygen observations? ∗Correspondence to: Xiaoying Gan (ganxiaoying@sjtu.edu.cn) 1We follow the same method of data gridding in He et al. (2019) with 1◦×1◦spatial resolution, 1-year temporal resolution and 0-5500 meters (33 depth levels) of the global ocean. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Challenges. This research question drives the design of specific deep learning methods for re- constructing global ocean deoxygenation. Fortunately, despite the severe sparse observations, the missing values contains implicit spatio-temporal correlations with neighboring observations. Mean- while, multiple physical-biogeochemical factors show strong connections with dissolved oxygen. However, as a double-edged sword, accurately characterizing the complex correlations between missing values and sparse observations involves two main challenges: (1) Irregular 4D spatio- temporal heterogeneity. Dynamic ocean is a four-dimensional irregular spatio-temporal area that includes longitude, latitude, depth, and time. Constrained by both tectonic plates and seafloor to- pography, the ocean is not a regular cube for gridding. In addition, the spatio-temporal correlations in various regions are different due to the influence of ocean circulations and climate changes. (2) Coupled physical-biogeochemical properties. The concentration of oceanic dissolved oxygen is in- fluenced by a variety of factors. For one thing, the solubility of oxygen in the water is affected by physical factors, including temperature, salinity and pressure. For another, biological processes, such as photosynthesis and respiration, and organic matter decomposition play a significant role in regulating dissolved oxygen concentrations. Our Work.

Accurately reconstructing the ocean's deoxygenation is crucial for assessing and protecting marine ecosystems in response to climate change. Existing numerical simulations, dominated by experts, fail to capture the dynamic variations caused by global warming and human activities. Moreover, the high cost of data collection has resulted in sparse historical observations, making precise reconstruction challenging. In this work, we propose OXYGENERATOR, the first spatio-temporal graph learning model, to reconstruct global ocean deoxygenation from 1920 to 2023. Specifically, to address the heterogeneity across large temporal and spatial scales, we propose zoning-varying graph message-passing to capture the complex oceanographic correlations between missing values and sparse observations. Additionally, to further calibrate uncertainty, we incorporate inductive bias from dissolved oxygen (DO) variations and chemical effects.
