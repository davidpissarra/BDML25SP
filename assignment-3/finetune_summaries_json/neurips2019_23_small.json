Joint species distribution models are useful to learn inter-species relationships and species re- sponse to the environment. The climates’ impact on the tree species is measured through species abundance in an area. We compare the model’s performance across all ecological domains and study the sensitivity of the climate variables. With the prediction of abundances, tree species populations can be predicted in the future and measure the impact of climate change on tree populations. 1 Introduction Ecologist expect the rapid change in climate to have unprecedented impacts on species geographical redistribution. Shifts in economically important species will likely have signiﬁcant impacts on human well-being, forest management strategies and conservation planning [ 1,9,13]. Reliably predicting future patterns in species distributions has become a major goal in ecology, and hence numerous species distribution models have been developed [ 1,10,3]. Modern implementations use historical climate data and a few topographic variables to predict individual species abundance, i.e. number of individuals per targeted area [5]. Most of these algorithms are univariate approaches and focus on individual key species separately [ 10]. However, most species interact with others and their correlation can hold crucial information. This is particularly true for rare species, whose records may be limited in number and borrowing strength from co-occurring species may be fundamental to improve predictions and reduce their uncertainty [5]. This has motivated the use of, Joint Species Distribution models (JSDM), a group of multivariate approaches that generally use the partial correlation matrix among responses to estimate their interactions [5]. Another key challenge in species distribution modeling is how to address the role of scale on the ecological drivers controlling species distribution [ 6]. For example, both SDM and JSDM are generally trained on continental datasets. The resulting models may fail when used to make predictions for local areas, because the same environmental features may have different effects on species abundance locally [ 8]. Understanding and integrating the scaling rules behind changes in features effects will potentially unlock the opportunity to explicitly implement SDMs universally applicable. Yet, to date we don’t even have a complete analysis of the role of scale on joint species distribution modeling. To address this limit, we studied the relationship of species distributions and species interactions across multiple ecological domains and scales utilizing the generalized joint attribute model (GJAM) 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.[6]. GJAM is a cutting-edge and open source JSDM. Using GJAM for the purpose of this multi-scale analysis has several advantages: (1) it is one of the few joint multilevel model of species abundance available for ecologists, (2) it integrates partial correlations among species and estimates structure among their interactions [ 14]; (3) changes in models coefﬁcients can easily be interpreted; (4) it has been used extensively in the last few years, including for predicting tree species abundance at continental scale. By applying GJAM across different scales we ﬁnd that species have different interaction patterns and sensitivity to environmental features and we ﬁnd similar results for different US ecological domains. 2 Methodology In this section we will demonstrate a method of modeling tree species behaviours in different environments. We use GJAM, a JSDM that is well suited for handling multifarious data [6]. LetYi2RSrepresent the abundances of Sunique species in the ithplots, and Xi2RQbe the feature vectors consisting of the Qclimate variables corresponding to each plot, for 1\u0014i\u0014n. We model (for the sake of space and simplicity assume all features are continuous): Yi\u0018N(B>Xi;\u0006) (1) WhereN(\u0001,\u0001)is the multivariate normal distribution, B2RQ\u0002Ssymbolizes the species response to the climate variables, and \u00062RS\u0002Sis a covariance matrix that resembles the species interaction between each other. Given observations for XandY;GJAM estimates Band\u0006using equation (1), we refer the reader to [ 6] for further details. With the distribution of species and climate variables the model can predict the species response in a plot. 2.1 Modeling across Different Ecological Domains GJAM has been previously used to learn continental joint species distribution of trees [ 6] using FIA. In this study we further investigate how climate interacts with scale at different geographical regions by applying GJAM to 20 independent ecological domains deﬁned by Neon [ 12]. We use Bto study the climate variables’ impact on the species across different ecological domains by comparing it from one domain to another and across scales. Similarly, \u0006can be used to study species interaction across all domains. Also, having the climate variables the model can predict the species response for plots with no samples or at another point in time.
