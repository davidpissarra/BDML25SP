In this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of forecasting extreme and severe drought events by introducing a novel loss function Surrogate Quantile and Shape loss (SQUASH) that combines weighted quantile loss and dynamic time-warping-based shape loss. We show the effectiveness of the proposed loss functions for imbalanced time-series drought forecasting tasks on two regions in India and the USA. 1 Introduction Droughts are amongst the most damaging natural hazard with cascading impacts across multiple economic sectors, the environment, and society. For instance, droughts can lead to agriculture production losses, intense wildfires, waterways disruptions, water supply shortages, and many others. Improved drought forecasts followed by proper strategic planning can help to deal with these severe impacts of drought. However, despite several decades of progress, accurate forecasting of drought is still a challenge that is further compounded by climate change. Drought indices are commonly used to monitor and quantify droughts. Several drought indices have been proposed with different degrees of complexity, data requirements, physical processes, and purpose. Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) [ 1] and Standardized Precipitation Evapo- Transpiration (SPEI) [ 2] are two powerful and commonly used drought indices. For the purpose of this study, we focus on the SPEI as it takes the atmospheric water balance into account and is a more suited drought indicator in the context of climate change. Several approaches based on stochastic, probabilistic, and machine learning techniques have been proposed in the literature to forecast the SPEI and other indices at multiple time scales. The models like Artificial Neural Network(ANN) [ 3], Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [ 4], Convolutional LSTM [ 5], Wavelet ANN [ 6], integrated ANN [ 7] have been demonstrated. In [ 7], a hybrid neural network is proposed that combines multiple models trained using different losses to improve the accuracy of drought forecasting. However, this approach does not explicitly capture the temporal dimension while predicting extreme drought conditions. Despite significant progress, a key challenge Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.in forecasting drought indices, including SPEI, remains. The existing work on drought forecasting does not emphasize both evaluation and analysis of the extreme and severe drought as well as wet events. Specifically, current approaches do not adequately address the imbalance in time-series forecasting aspects. The imbalance is due to the fact that the extremely dry and wet events are few as compared to normal events and therefore are difficult to forecast. In this paper, we attempt to address the above-mentioned challenge by developing a novel loss function (SQUASH) that is differentiable, captures the shape error of the time-series aspect of the problem, handles imbalanced data, and is computationally efficient. We validate our approach for multi-step forecasting of SPEI drought index over two regions in the USA and India. A detailed ablation study with different surrogate loss functions is present in this article. 2 Methodology We pose the problem of forecasting SPEI drought index at a regional level as a multi-horizon forecasting task.

The goal of training a drought forecasting model is to improve the overall forecasting accuracy as well as that of rare events such as severe and extremely dry conditions. The standard quantile losses do not address the problem of highly imbalanced time-series data. We introduce a SQUASH loss that combines weighted quantile loss and shape loss to improve the accuracy of extreme event forecasting. We used this loss functions to train a Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [ 8] model. We used TFT as it is a state-of-the-art model for multi-horizon forecasting and can model different types of inputs. TFT uses LSTM-based encoder-decoder architecture for encoding historical observation and future known inputs. It also uses a variable selection network and attention mechanism to identifying the importance of the features. 2.1 Surrogate Quantile and Shape (SQUASH) Loss For reliable drought\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
