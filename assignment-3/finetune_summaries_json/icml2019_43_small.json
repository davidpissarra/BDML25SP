Introduction Landslides occur throughout the world and are caused by a range of factors, including natural: earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, heavy rainfalls, man-made: deforestation, dam constructions, and illegal mining (we refer the reader to (Gariano & Guzzetti, 2016; Lewkowicz & Way, 2019) for relevant literature). Fig. 1 shows one such location in the village of Malin, located in Pune (Maharashtra, India). This landslide was classiﬁed as occurred due to heavy rainfall, although there are other possible factors that may have led to the eventual slide: (1) deforestation, (2) agriculture, (3) mining, and (4) the construction of a dam in the area. These factors tend to have a long term effect of on soil forma- tion and properties. For example, deforestation is a major contributor to climate change due to the removal of natural carbon sink, but it is equally responsible for loss of root structures that ﬁrmly hold the soil. We propose to lever- age the data available from affected landslide(s) locations 1Chester F.

Furthermore, by knowing the probable causes and effect, we propose to use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to model what an area would look like under certain conditions. For example, if there is suspicion of illegal mining in a re- gion, a network that has been trained to look for variations due to natural and human activities can infer what the com- position would look like post mining.

At this stage, we consider gathering data from six main causes of landslide occurrences—volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, de- forestation, heavy rainfall, mining, and construction—and one positive sample—thriving forest ecosystem. 2.

Introduction\n\nLandslides occur worldwide and are caused by various factors, including natural events such as earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and heavy rainfall, as well as human activities like deforestation, dam construction, and illegal mining. For instance, a landslide in the village of Malin, Pune, India, was attributed to heavy rainfall, although other factors like deforestation, agriculture, mining, and dam construction may have contributed to the event. These factors can have a long-term impact on soil formation and properties.\n\nWe propose to leverage data from affected landslide locations to study the underlying changes and predict potential future events based on similar patterns. Our approach aims to use conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs) to model what an area would look like under certain conditions. For example, if there is suspicion of illegal mining in a region, a network trained to detect variations due to natural and human activities can infer the composition post-mining. This information can be used to detect and halt the activity more easily. Similarly, we can infer the best locations to plant trees and mitigate soil erosion through reforestation efforts.\n\nWe consider gathering data from six main causes of landslide occurrences: volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, deforestation, heavy rainfall, mining, and construction, as well as a positive sample – a thriving forest ecosystem.\n\n2.
