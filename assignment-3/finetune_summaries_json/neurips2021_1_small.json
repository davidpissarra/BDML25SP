This assimilated dataset is used for the next round of training ensemble models and the cyclical process is repeated until the performance improvement plateaus. We post process our results with Conditional Random Fields. Our approach sets a new state-of-the-art on the Sentinel-1 dataset with 0.7654 IoU, an impressive improvement over the 0.60 IoU baseline. Our method, which we release with all the code and models2, can also be used as an open science benchmark for the Sentinel-1 dataset. 1 Introduction Flooding events are on the rise due to climate change [ 35], increasing sea levels and increasing extreme weather events, resulting in 10 billion dollars worth of damages annually. Scientists and decision makers can use live Earth observations data via satellites like Sentinel-1 to develop real- time response and mitigation tactics and understand ﬂooding events. The Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI) 2021 competition on Flood Detection provides SAR Sentinel-1 imagery with labeled pixels for a geographic area prior and post ﬂood event. SAR satellites, such as Sentinel-1, see through clouds and at night so can be used everywhere all the time, making its solutions deployable at scale. Participants are tasked with a semantic segmentation task that identiﬁes pixels that are ﬂooded and is evaluated with Intersection over Union metric (IoU). Improved ﬂood segmentation in real-time results in delineating open water ﬂood areas. Identifying ﬂood levels aids in effective disaster response and mitigation. Combining the ﬂood extent mapping with local topography generates a plan of action with downstream results including predicting the direction of ﬂow of water, redirecting ﬂood waters, organizing resources for distribution etc. Such a system can also recommend a path of least ﬂood levels in real-time that disaster response professionals can potentially adopt. \u0003Equal contribution. Sayak focused on the implementations and contributed to the writing, Siddha focused on ideation, experimentation, and writing. 2Our code and models are available on GitHub: https://git.io/JW3P8. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Feature based machine learning techniques are also prominent [ 27] but are intractable as human annotators and featurizers cannot scale. Manual annotation in real time can easily exceed $62,5003 daily, and a manual solution quickly becomes intractable. Motivated by prior art [ 44,45,7,19], we look at semi-supervised techniques, that assume predicted labels with maximally predicted probability as ground truth, and we apply it to ﬂood segmentation. Similar to [ 19,3], we treat pseudo labels as an entropy regularizer which eventually outperforms other conventional methods with a small subset of labeled data. For real time deployment we benchmark our solution similar to [ 23,36], both of which utilize datasets like WorldFloods or multispectral datasets to enable ﬂood detection, but require large scale manual annotation. Contrary to both, our work with semi supervision reduces the human-in-the-loop load and allows us to take advantage of large unannotated examples in a simple manner. Evidence indicates that post processing with Conditional Random Fields (CRF) [ 17,9,2,42] may yield improved performance especially for semantic segmentation, and, satellite data [ 12]. Our work follows along similar lines when we post process with CRFs for ﬂood segmentation. Our contributions are: ( 1) We propose a semi-supervised learning scheme with pseudo-labeling that derives conﬁdence estimates from U-Net ensembles. With this we establish the new state-of-the-art ﬂood segmenter and to the best of our knowledge we believe this is the ﬁrst work to try out semi- supervised learning to improve ﬂood segmentation models. ( 2) We show that our method is scalable through psuedo labels and generalizable through varying data distributions in different geographic locations and thus is inexpensive to deploy scalably. ( 3) Additionally, we benchmark the inference pipeline and show that it can be performed in real time aiding in real time disaster mitigation efforts. Our approach also includes uncertainty estimation, allowing disaster response teams to understand its reliability and safety. In an effort to promote open science and cross-collaboration we release all our code and models. 2 Data The contest dataset consists of 66k tiled images from various geographic locations.
