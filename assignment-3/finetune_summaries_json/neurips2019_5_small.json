Towards the goal of mapping global wind energy infrastructure, we develop deep learning models to automatically localize wind turbines in satellite imagery. Using only image-level supervision, we experiment with several different weakly supervised convolutional neural networks to detect the presence and locations of wind turbines. Our best model, which we call DeepWind, achieves an average precision of 0.866 on the test set. DeepWind demonstrates the potential of automated approaches for identifying wind turbine locations using satellite imagery, ultimately assisting with the management and adoption of wind energy worldwide. 1 Introduction Decarbonization of the electricity sector and decreasing costs are accelerating the adoption of renewable energy, with 50% of the worldwide capacity to be renewable by 2035 ( 1). Wind energy in particular is growing at a rapid pace, with 591 GW of capacity deployed by 2018—a 60% increase in 5 years—and a 130% increase expected by 2035 ( 2). Knowing the location and type of installed wind turbines is critical for a variety of stakeholders, such as: (i) wind developers to identify the best new areas for deployments ( 3); (ii) electricity grid operators to integrate renewable energy, to perform real-time system operation, and to plan capacity expansion ( 4); (iii) utilities and city planners to plan the management of local demand ( 5); and (iv) policymakers to design and estimate the impact of incentives and other contracting policies ( 6). Currently, there are more than 398,000 wind turbines installed worldwide and only 42% are mapped with accurate locations ( 7;2). An automated approach to localizing wind turbines would enable efﬁcient identiﬁcation of their locations and ultimately the construction of a more complete, up-to-date, global database of wind energy infrastructure. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have demonstrated success in a variety of image-based localization tasks, including semantic segmentation ( 8) and object detection ( 9;10). Much of this success, however, has been attributed to the use of fully supervised methods that require large datasets with detailed annotations like bounding boxes and segmentation masks, which can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. Satellite imagery offers an immense data source for image-based localization tasks, but lacks this detailed annotation which is necessary for fully supervised model development. To address this, we leverage advances in weakly supervised methods which use image- level classiﬁcation labels to localize objects, without the use of detailed annotation. These methods have emerged as an effective alternative to their fully supervised counterparts, enabling advances in various ﬁelds, including healthcare (11; 12) and energy (13). \u0003Equal contribution. 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.(Latitude, Longitude)  (35.295, -101.178)  (35.296, -101.172)  (35.296, -101.165)  Satellite Image Weakly Supervised  CNN Response Map Peak Detection Predicted Locations  Figure 1: The weakly supervised localization models input a satellite image and output a predicted response map which localizes the turbines in the image. A peak detection module identiﬁes local maxima in the response map and merges them based on proximity. The predicted locations in the image can be converted to the geographic locations (latitude, longitude coordinates) of the turbines. In this work, we develop DeepWind, a deep learning model to automatically localize wind turbines from satellite imagery. We leverage satellite images annotated with image-level binary classiﬁcation labels from the U.S. Wind Turbine Database, a manually curated database containing more than 50,000 wind turbine locations in the U.S. ( 14). Without bounding boxes for fully supervised localization models, we develop a variety of weakly supervised localization models to identify the locations of wind turbines in satellite imagery. We evaluate each model on turbine location prediction, and our best model, DeepWind, achieves an average precision of 0.866 on the test set. 2 Data The dataset used to develop the models contains 42,255 positive images and 58,672 negative images for a total of 100,927 images. We use latitude and longitude coordinates in the U.S. Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB) for the positives, excluding those that were labeled with low location conﬁdence or did not have corresponding imagery ( 14). We have two negative sets, one sampled randomly across the U.S. and the other containing visually similar objects to turbines (difﬁcult negatives) with an open source GeoVisual search tool ( 15). For all inputs, we obtain high resolution satellite imagery (\u00191.2m) of size 1500\u00021500.
