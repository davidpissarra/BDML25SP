We introduce a new method to acquire data and model 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based surrogates for CFDs, which predict a data center’s temperature distribution based on server workload, HV AC airflow rate, and temperature set points. The surrogate model’s predictions are highly accurate, with a mean absolute error of 0.31 °C compared to CFD- based ground truth temperatures. The surrogate model is 3 orders of magnitude faster than CFDs in generating the temperature maps for similar-sized data centers, enabling real-time applications. It helps to quickly identify and reduce temperature hot spots( 7.7%) by redistributing workloads and saving cooling energy( 2.5%). It also aids in optimizing server placement during installation, preventing issues, and increasing equipment lifespan. These optimizations boost sustainability by reducing energy use, improving server performance, and lowering environmental impact. 1 Introduction Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFDs) are commonly used to simulate data center (DC) thermo-fluid dynamics for energy-efficient design. A significant challenge for CFD tools lies in building and then simulating models of data centers, which can house thousands of computing equipment such as servers, network devices, racks, sensors, and intricate cooling systems. However, the time-consuming nature of CFD for large data centers is often incongruent with the real-time demands of modern data centers, where timely decision-making can lead to substantial energy savings, improved performance, and reduced environmental impact. A CFD surrogate model, that can provide results in real time, can optimize workload distribution to minimize data center hotspot temperatures Ilager et al. (2020); Lin et al. (2022); Jin et al. (2023); Fresca and Manzoni (2022). By integrating this model into current data center control software, designers can enhance control algorithms for workload scheduling and cooling optimizations, re- sulting in greater cooling efficiency leading to diminished carbon footprint. However, most of these approaches have made extremely simplifying assumptions for the premise of the problem: Chen et al. (2021) assumes that data center cabinets can be randomly simulated by placing rectangular grids on a ∗Corresponding author †These authors contributed equally Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2D map. Furthermore, these surrogate models only generate a 2D temperature output map that has little consequence for hotspot reduction purposes. We need an approach that can process real-world CFD data from custom data center configurations (Figure 1 left), and generate surrogate models that can \"accurately\" predict the temperature at any point in space of the 3D volume (Figure 1 middle). This \"effectively allows\" downstream applications (Figure 1 right) like temperature hotspot reduction for a given workload using an iterative optimization approach. 2 Proposed Solution This paper applies a 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for predicting data center 3D temperature distribution that can lead to faster inference suitable for real-time applications. The process of mapping raw CFD data to inputs and labels for training the 3D CNNs is a complex process. We developed a detailed methodology for acquiring and processing this data to create 3D input and output images for the surrogate model, as discussed next. An overview of this approach is illustrated in Figure 2. CFD Data acquisition : We collected CFD data of the data center model with M X N arrangement of IT Cabinets (Figure 2 left) with each cabinet having a custom arrangement of an HPE Flex Fabric 5920 Switch, 4U HPE Nimble Storage HF20 and 12 HPE DL380 servers. Similar to real data centers, we considered the absence and presence of cold-aisle containment. The data acquisition process was conducted by the commercial CFD software, 6SigmaDCX 6SigmaDCX | Future Facilities (2023) automated using 6Sigma CommanderTM: a CLI was run using a Python script to execute thousands of simulations in batches. 3D Input Data : We mapped the raw data to voxel tensors, to generate an input representation, which captures the data center’s geometry and component details with each channel indicating one physical property. In our application, it includes the power of IT equipment, the ACU set point, and the ACU fan speed. The voxel tensor represents the exact 3D position and structure of components like cabinets and ACUs as specified in 6SigmaDCX. These components are depicted in a quantized room size of 64×48×64voxels from an original size of 6×4.5×6meters. This quantization ensures information accuracy and compatibility with the 3D CNN’s dimensions. The metrics are volume-normalized, indicating the dispersion of each metric over its volume.
