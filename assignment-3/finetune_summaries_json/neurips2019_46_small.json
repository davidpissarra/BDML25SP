Motivating Field Studies As motivation, we highlight two ongoing projects that ex- amine gaseous emissions in natural environments: seasonal Arctic thawing and volcanic outgassing (ﬁeld sites illus- trated in Appendix A). Seasonal Arctic Thawing In the high-Arctic, seasonal melt of landfast ice (e.g., ice over lakes, coasts), has been shown to trigger large, episodic outgassing of CO 2and CH 4 (Zona et al., 2016; Lamarche-Gagnon et al., 2019; Karls- son et al., 2013). Quantifying emissions during the spring freshet period will help to reﬁne emission budget models for the region. Arctic thawing is directly impacted by a warming climate, which triggers a positive feedback loop as longer thaw seasons in more of the Arctic environment lead to the release of sequestered gases (Ernakovich et al., 2014). Our work will use underwater, surface, and aerial vehicles to characterize outgassing at the land-ocean continuum. Volcanic Outgassing Major volcanic eruptions produce gases, aerosols, and ash that inﬂuence climate processes such as cloud formation, solar reﬂectance, and upper ocean fertilization (Robock, 2000). Single volcanic eruptions can have a dramatic impact on global climate, as illustrated by the Tambora volcano 1816 eruption which caused a decrease in global temperatures up to 0:7\u000eC and led to a wintry sum- mer that resulted in major food shortages across the North- ern hemisphere (Stothers, 1984). Even when not actively erupting, volcanic gases diffuse through the soil and escape through ﬁssures and cracks in the crust, contributing to at- mospheric concentrations. Our work will use aerial vehicles to monitor gas ratios in order to develop a predictive model of major geological events and passive emission rates. 3. Machine Learning and Autonomous Sensors for Emission Models We propose the following uniﬁed framework for au- tonomous environmental monitoring: 1) using gas diffusion models from physics-based scientiﬁc modeling to plan max- imally informative data collection paths, and 2) using the collected data to improve the science models via data-drivenScientiﬁc Machine Learning for Monitoring Greenhouse Gas Emissions scientiﬁc machine learning. These two approaches should reinforce each other in a feedback loop; initial models can be used to select promising locations for collecting environ- mental data, and machine learning techniques can use these data to improve the emission models. This framework is illustrated in Fig. 1. The combination of these approaches is particularly com- pelling: science models establish a rich structure for the data, but are brittle under noisy, uncertain measurements and dif- ﬁcult to update with streaming data;\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nMarshes, estuaries, and estuaries are the largest sources of greenhouse gas emissions; nearly half of all CO2 emissions are from air-sea exchange alone (Solomon et al., 2007; Le Quéré et al., 2012). An increase in anthropogenic sources within the last 150 years has overwhelmed natural sinks of these potent chemicals. We are interested in characterizing natural \"climate drivers\" (e.g., air-sea flux) or natural processes that, as a result of increased anthropogenic emissions, are \"climate driven\" (e.g., melting permafrost). To provide insight into the magnitude of gas flux from natural sources, spatio-temporal distributions of gases, and processes that drive local emissions, in situ instrumentation carried by a robotic platform is uniquely suited to study small- to mid-scale emission events for extended periods of time over large distances. However, collecting scientifically rich datasets of dynamic emission events requires adaptive, online planning under uncertainty and sophisticated learned representations of physical phenomena, posing challenges for even state-of-the-art machine learning and planning paradigms.\n\nBy uniting classical scientific computing and machine learning techniques, we aim to create novel models of environmental gas emissions that can be used in combination with decision-making and navigation under uncertainty to collect scientifically valuable, in situ data on natural greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nWe highlight two ongoing projects that examine gaseous emissions in natural environments: seasonal Arctic thawing and volcanic outgassing (field sites illustrated in Appendix A).

Single volcanic eruptions can have a dramatic impact on global climate, as illustrated by the Tambora volcano 1816 eruption, which caused a decrease in global temperatures up to 0.7°C and led to a wintry summer that resulted in major food shortages across the Northern hemisphere (Stothers, 1984). Even when not actively erupting, volcanic gases diffuse through the soil and escape through fissures and cracks in the crust, contributing to atmospheric concentrations. Our work will use aerial vehicles to monitor gas ratios in order to develop a predictive model of major geological events and passive emission rates.\n\nWe propose a unified framework for autonomous environmental monitoring: 1) using gas diffusion models from physics-based scientific modeling to plan maximally informative data collection paths, and 2) using the collected data to improve the science models via data-driven scientific machine learning.
