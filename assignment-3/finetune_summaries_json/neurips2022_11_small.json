Detecting and integrating levee structures to global hydrological simulations is thus expected to enable more precise ﬂood simulation and risk assessment, with important consequences for ﬂood risk mitigation. In this work, we propose a new formulation to the problem of identifying levee structures: instead of detecting levees themselves, we focus on segmenting the region of the ﬂoodplain they protect. This formulation allows to better identify protected areas, to leverage the structure of hydrological data, and to simplify the integration of levee information to global hydrological models. 1 Introduction (a) Floodplain and protected areas (b) Levees & pro- tected areas Figure 1: Illustration of our problem formulation (a) We aim to accurately segment levee protected areas (in blue) of the ﬂoodplain (in orange) (b) Different from related work, our approach explic- itly models protected areas (blue) instead of levee locations (yellow)Flood risk is deﬁned as the product of haz- ard (the probability and strength of a ﬂood event), exposure (the population and goods sub- ject to ﬂooding) and vulnerability (the capacity of a society to deal with the event) [ 1]. Cli- mate change is intensifying hazard risk by ris- ing sea levels and increasing ﬂood frequency, while overall exposure increases with popula- tion growth and densiﬁcation of coastal and ﬂu- vial ﬂood-prone regions [ 2]. Although ﬂood- ing events occur locally, their impact goes be- yond the local tragedies of devastation. With the globally interconnected nature of economic activities, local disasters also disturb supply chains at global scale [ 3,4], making ﬂood risk assessment and mitigation a global challenge. To protect people and goods from ﬂood risks, our two main assets are water management in- frastructure (i.e.; levees and dams), and early warning systems. In the context of water man- agement, it has been shown that overwhelmed levees are a source of disastrous ﬂoods [ 2] as it comes Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.with surprise. Better dimensioning of ﬂood defense requires more accurate ﬂoods risk map account- ing for climate change induced hazard risk (e.g. shift of the event characteristic distribution). Hydrological simulations contribute to reduce vulnerability as they allow to predict and thus mitigate ﬂood events [ 5]. Global hydrodynamic models rely on global spaceborn Digital Elevation Model (DEMs) to route river discharge through landscape and represent river/ﬂoodplain interactions [ 6,7], that do not include man-made river ﬂow control infrastructure such as levees and dams. Thus, ﬂood predictions computed using current global hydrological models do not account for the impact of levees on river discharge. Integrating levees to global hydrology models would allow to generate more accurate and reliable global ﬂood risk assessment. While the simulation of dams impact on river discharge at global scale have been introduced by the hydrology modeling community [ 8,9, 10], the representation of levee impact on river discharge has not yet passed from case studies to global modeling [ 11]. The main bottleneck is the non-availability of a global dataset gathering worldwide river control equipment. Flood-protection levee datasets are generally conﬁned to territorial boundaries (national datasets) and are scarcely available and poorly documented. A very recent effort has been put to collect, standardize and homogenize ﬂood-protection levee data from various sources into a single open source dataset [ 12]. But this effort has been limited so far to delta areas that present both ﬂuvial (from river) and coastal (from sea) ﬂood risks. The most-up-to-date river levee dataset is the National Levee Dataset (NLD) from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), which we use in this study. One way to extend our knowledge of levee locations is to use Machine Learning (ML) to learn the relationship between levee locations and a set of globally available variables from available local levee data, so as to infer levee locations on a global scale from these variables. Unfortunately, this problem has proved very challenging: Levees are built to have maximum impact on ﬂood protection at minimum construction cost (and so at minimum size), which makes it notoriously hard to detect. While some local high precision DEMs are precise enough to identify levees from elevation data [13,14,15], the precision needed to detect levee structures is far higher than that of global DEMs. Another line of work [ 16,17], closer to the present study\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nVegetation is not the focus of this text, but rather levees are built to protect people and goods from flood, which alters river hydrology, but are still not accounted for by global hydrological models. Detecting and integrating levee structures into global hydrological simulations is expected to enable more precise flood simulation and risk assessment, with important consequences for flood risk mitigation.\n\nIn this work, we propose a new formulation to the problem of identifying levee structures: instead of detecting levees themselves, we focus on segmenting the region of the floodplain they protect. This formulation allows for better identification of protected areas, leveraging the structure of hydrological data, and simplifying the integration of levee information into global hydrological models.\n\nFlood risk is defined as the product of hazard (the probability and strength of a flood event), exposure (the population and goods subject to flooding), and vulnerability (the capacity of a society to deal with the event). Climate change is intensifying hazard risk by rising sea levels and increasing flood frequency, while overall exposure increases with population growth and densification of coastal and fluvial flood-prone regions.\n\nAlthough flooding events occur locally, their impact goes beyond the local tragedies of devastation. With the globally interconnected nature of economic activities, local disasters also disturb supply chains at a global scale, making flood risk assessment and mitigation a global challenge. To protect people and goods from flood risks, our two main assets are water management infrastructure (i.e., levees and dams), and early warning systems.\n\nIn the context of water management, it has been shown that overwhelmed levees are a source of disastrous floods.
