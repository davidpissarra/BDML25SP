We find that all of our neural-based approaches improve over conventional buffelgrass green-up models, and discuss how neural model deployment promises significant resource savings. 1 Introduction Increasingly severe wildfire seasons dominate headlines; these out-of-control blazes can be among the most visible results of ongoing climate change [ 20,3]. In the Southwest United States, wildfires are made worse by an invasive plant, Pennisetum ciliare, known commonly as buffelgrass, because the grass burns twice as hot as native vegetation [ 17]. Furthermore, buffelgrass is a threat to biodiversity in many environments [ 15] and poses a particular threat to the Sonoran Desert, where many plants are not fire adapted; the resulting grass-fire cycle excludes native plants and may result in a conversion of Sonoran Desert shrubland to monoculture grassland with increasingly severe wildfires [31]. In this paper, we remotely predict buffelgrass readiness for herbicidal treatment using a combination of satellite sensing and deep learning. Wildfire risk from buffelgrass can be reduced through effective herbicidal treatments, but only after the plant “greens-up” from favorable conditions to at least50% greenness [ 8]. Unfortunately, predicting buffelgrass green-up is a difficult task, due to varying precipitation, soil substrates, sun exposure, elevation, geographic location, etc. [ 29,28,5]. Small groups of dedicated volunteers and professionals rely on conventional precipitation-only models to allocate resources, but these models suffer from wastefully high false-positive rates [ 8]. Acknowledging urgency, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior recently announced $200,000 in additional funds for Saguaro National Park buffelgrass treatments alone [ 10]; however, estimates suggest that treating the entire park would would cost tens of millions of dollars [ 9]. Our paper addresses a pressing need for intelligent green-up predictions in the fight against buffelgrass. Contributions Our two main contributions are: (1) improvements over conventional buffelgrass green-up models using deep learning models and satellite sensing for climate and imagery and (2) an analysis of the climate factors that influence our model’s predictions. We are not the first to note that remote sensing offers a way to observe buffelgrass over large tracts of land, although as far as we are aware we are the first to employ satellite imagery and climate modeling to predict phenological changes in buffelgrass [ 29,34]. We improve on currently deployed models (based on accumulated ∗Equal contribution.

[32] found that the clearest link between anthropogenic climate change and wildfires is through increased “warming-driven fuel drying.” Buffelgrass is an example of dry, organic fuel: it dehydrates for three-fourths of the year, becoming yel- lowish and tinder-dry despite still being alive, and most worryingly it can double in cover ev- ery 2-3 years [ 30,1]. Recent work has highlighted the effectiveness of herbicidal treatment, but explicitly calls for increased detection efforts and better resource allocation [ 14]. Field work and heuristic models based on weather data have been shown to predict the greenness or spread of known sites with reasonable accuracy[ 21,8,4]. Leveraging publicly available re- mote sensing technology has also been used in the fight against buffelgrass; Zhao et al. [34], Figure 1: Clustering of buffel- grass observations in Arizona made by USA-NPN staff and vol- unteers.for example, address the problem of buffelgrass site detection using UA Vs and satellite imagery. Other prior work has also examined detecting unobserved buffelgrass sites using remote imagery, but does not explicitly model the readiness of those sites for herbicidal treatment [7, 2, 16]. Green-up prediction requires phenological observations. A pri- mary source of observations is the USA National Phenology Network (USA-NPN), a national-scale monitoring and research initiative focused on collecting research-grade phenological data, information, and forecasts [ 4]. USA-NPN offers a “Buffelgrass Pheno Forecast,” which currently uses the baseline accumulated precipitation model based on thresholding [ 29] and forecasts 50% green up at 4km resolution across the state of Arizona [ 8]. Ad- ditionally, USA-NPN facilitates the collection of high-quality ob- servations of plant and animal life cycle stages through Nature’s Notebook, a freely available phenology citizen science platform and dataset used by thousands\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
