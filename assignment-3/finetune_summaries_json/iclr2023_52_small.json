We apply Shapley values, a popular explainable artificial in- telligence (XAI) method, and the latest findings from XAI for regression models, to uncover the strategies ML models have learned from operational wind turbine data. Our findings reveal that the trend towards ever larger model architectures, driven by a focus on test set performance, can result in physically implausible model strategies. Therefore, we call for a more prominent role of XAI methods in model selection. Moreover, we propose a practical approach to utilize explana- tions for root cause analysis in the context of wind turbine performance monitor- ing. This can help to reduce downtime and increase the utilization of turbines in the field. 1 I NTRODUCTION The energy sector is responsible for the majority of global greenhouse gas emissions Ritchie et al. (2020) and wind energy is to play a key role in its decarbonization Council (2022). Accurate wind turbine power curve models are important enablers for this transition. Coupled with meteorological forecasts, they are used for energy yield prediction Optis & Perr-Sauer (2019); Nielson et al. (2020) and thereby crucial for stable operation of electricity grids with high wind penetration. Moreover, they have been successfully utilized for wind turbine condition monitoring Kusiak et al. (2009); Schlechtingen et al. (2013); Butler et al. (2013), which reduces downtime and directly increases the amount of renewable energy in the electricity mix. Therefore, power curve modelling has received plenty of attention (see Sohoni et al. (2016) for a comprehensive review). While early approaches have mainly focused on parametric models based on physical considerations (e.g. Kusiak et al. (2009)), complex non-linear ML models have become the state-of-the-art today Methaprayoon et al. (2007); Schlechtingen et al. (2013); Pelletier et al. (2016); Optis & Perr-Sauer (2019); Nielson et al. (2020). However, the wind community has often uttered the need for more transparency and interpretability of ML approaches to be trusted and deliver actionable results Tautz-Weinert & Watson (2016); Sohoni et al. (2016); Optis & Perr-Sauer (2019); Chatterjee & Dethlefs (2021); Barreto et al. (2021). As a response, researchers have started to utilize methods from the field of XAI Samek et al. (2021); Montavon et al. (2018); Lapuschkin et al. (2019) (compare for example Chatterjee & Dethlefs (2021)). Several works have applied Shapley values, a popular XAI method thanks to its easy to use implementation Lundberg & Lee (2017), for power prediction Tenfjord & Strand (2020); Pang et al. (2021) and turbine monitoring Chatterjee & Dethlefs (2020); Mathew et al. (2022); Movses- sian et al. (2022).
