The former is bottle-necked by both computational cost and the difficulty of modelling plasmas, and the latter is bottle-necked by the relative paucity of data. To address this issue, this work applies the neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) framework to the problem of predicting a subset of plasma dynamics, namely the coupled plasma current and internal inductance dynamics. As the neural ODE framework allows for the natural inclusion of physics-based inductive biases, we train both physics-based and neural network models on data from the Alcator C-Mod fusion reactor and find that a model that combines physics-based equations with a neural ODE performs better than both existing physics-motivated ODEs and a pure neural ODE model. 1 Introduction Recent advances in nuclear fusion have offered hope that it may arrive in time to help combat climate change by serving as a firm energy source to complement intermittent renewables. Within the fusion landscape, the tokamak is often considered the leading candidate for a fusion pilot plant, promising long-duration pulses with an existing physics basis offering a clear path to high energy gain Wurzel and Hsu [2022], Sorbom et al. [2015]. However, tokamaks are prone to sudden, highly energetic losses of plasma confinement induced by plasma instabilities. These events are known as “plasma disruptions”. While plasma disruptions don’t pose a threat to public safety, they do pose a significant threat to the economic viability of tokamaks Maris et al. [2023]. This threat motivates the development of reliable high-performance real-time plasma control systems that can predict the onset of instabilities and “soft-land” the plasma by rapidly de-energizing it to a manageable state. One of the major challenges to realizing more reliable and high-performance tokamak plasma control is the difficulty of modelling plasma dynamics. While recent work successfully demonstrated the application of deep reinforcement learning to magnetic control of tokamak plasmas Degrave et al. [2022], the physics relevant to magnetic control, i.e. Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), is the most well-simulated, and, furthermore, classical control techniques are already effective at tackling it. To successfully control other aspects of plasma dynamics, advances in modelling are needed. In this regard, both purely physics-based and data-driven approaches currently fall short. On the purely physics-based side, the highest fidelity plasma simulations available today require millions of CPU hours to arrive at a steady state solution, making them unusable for control development, and even Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.then require assumptions on boundary conditions such as the pressure gradient at the edge of the plasma Rodriguez-Fernandez et al. [2022]. This gap has motivated work on purely data-driven dynamics modelling with residual and recurrent neural networks, however, the relative paucity of data, distributional drift due to changes in hardware, and irregular measurement time-bases are major challenges Char et al. [2023], Abbate et al. [2021]. To tackle this problem, the neural ordinary differential equations (Neural ODEs) framework offers a promising path to improving the sample efficiency and robustness of data-driven prediction of plasma dynamics via the introduction of physics-based inductive biases. In this work, we explore the application of the neural ODE framework to a subset of the plasma dynamics problem. Namely, we model the coupled dynamics of plasma current, Ip, and plasma internal inductance Lito experimental data from the Alcator C-Mod fusion reactor. These coupled dynamics are of particular interest for “soft landing” as decreasing Ipis one of the primary objectives of soft-landing, but doing so generally increases Li, which is correlated with reduced plasma stability. Traditionally, partial differential equations (PDEs) would need to be evolved forward in time to predict the coupled dynamics of these two variables, but doing so is computationally intractable for the purposes of real-time control where decisions need to be made in milliseconds. Prior work Romero et al. [2010] derived a simple ODE model to predict these coupled dynamics. While parts of the derived model are high-confidence physics, parts of it involve intuition-based physics assumptions. In this work, we demonstrate that replacing the physics assumptions with a neural ODE, but keeping the high-confidence physics, yields a model that outperforms both the original model in Romero et al. [2010] and a full neural ODE. 2 Background 2.1 The Current Diffusion Equation The principled method to predict the coupled dynamics of plasma current and internal inductance is to evolve a partial differential equation (PDE) known as the current diffusion equation (CDE) Felici [2011]. The CDE, however, is coupled to the plasma density and temperature spatial profiles, which themselves require complex models of plasma turbulence and transport to evolve forward in time.
