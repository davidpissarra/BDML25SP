Technology that can capture CO 2 from anthropogenic sources, remove from atmosphere and sequester it at the gi- gaton scale by 2050 is required stop and reverse the impact of climate change. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) have been a promising technology in various applications including gas separation as well as CO 2capture from point-source ﬂue gases or removal from the atmosphere. MOFs offer unmatched surface area through their highly porous crystalline structure and MOF technology has poten- tial to become a leading adsorption-based CO 2separation technology providing high surface area, structure stability and chemical tunability. Due to its complex structure, MOF crystal structure (atoms and bonds) cannot be easily represented in tabular format for machine learning (ML) applications whereas graph neural networks (GNN) have already been explored in representation of simpler chem- ical molecules. In addition to difﬁculty in MOF data representation, an inﬁnite number of combinations can be created for MOF crystals, which makes ML ap- plications more suitable to alleviate dependency on subject matter experts (SME) than conventional computational methods. In this work, we propose training of GNNs in variational autoencoder (V AE) setting to create an end-to-end workﬂow for the generation of new MOF crystal structures directly from the data within the crystallographic information ﬁles (CIFs) and conditioned by additional CO 2 performance values. 1 N EED FOR CARBON CAPTURE FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MITIGATION Limiting global warming to 1.5\u000eC implies that net anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions worldwide decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reache net-zero by 2050 (IPCC, 2018). To achieve this target while ensuring a smooth energy transition, we need to reduce the emissions from hard-to-abate industrial CO 2sources such as power, cement, steel, and chemical plants. In this journey, CO 2capture, utilization, and sequestration (CCUS) will play a vital role by capturing at the sources and permanently storing in the subsurface. However, this ambitious goal requires global deployment of CO 2capture plants at a very large scale - increasing capture capacity from 40 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) today to 5635 mtpa by 2050 (Global CCS Institute, 2020). In the capture process, we must separate CO 2molecules from other gases that are present in the gas stream coming out of a power plant or an industrial facility. Several well-established separation technologies exist to remove CO 2from various emission sources, with solvent-based absorption technology being the most mature and deployed at industrial scale (Leung et al., 2018). The capture processes operating with aqueous amine (e.g., monoethanolamine) solvents, however, are plagued by high energy cost associated with solvent regeneration. The corrosive nature of amine solvents and emission of toxic amines with the treated gas are also challenges that need attention (Oko et al., 2017). To address these challenges, researchers have developed alternative solvents, such as non- aqueous and bi-phasic solvents. Apart from the solvent performance, the large size of absorption and desorption columns required in solvent-based capture plants imposes high capital expenditure. As a result, CO 2separation techniques using solid sorbents, membranes, and cryogenics have been 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 developed and tested at the laboratory scale and pilot scale (Abanades et al., 2015). Extensive research and development activities have been ongoing for the last two to three decades to increase the technical maturity of these nascent technologies and to reduce the cost of capture at industrial scale. Despite these efforts, there is a strong demand for new material development to improve the CO 2capture capacity and selectivity over other gases and to reduce the regeneration energy need. 2 M ETAL -ORGANIC FRAMEWORKS (MOF) FOR CO2 C APTURE There is an urgent need to develop new materials for CO 2capture with an objective to lower the cost of CO 2capture and the energy penalty. Different classes of materials are being explored for this application for their CO 2selectivity, afﬁnity towards CO 2and capture density. MOFs come across as promising candidates due to their large surface area, ﬂexibility in tuning surface properties for selectivity, tunable porous structure and, more importantly, scalability for industrial use.
