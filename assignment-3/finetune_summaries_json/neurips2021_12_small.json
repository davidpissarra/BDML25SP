We propose CyGNSSnet, a deep learning model for predicting wind speed from CyGNSS observables, and evaluate its potential for operational use. With CyGNSSnet, performance improves by 29% over the current operational model. We further introduce a hierarchical model, that combines an extreme value classiﬁer and a specialized CyGNSSnet and slightly improves predictions for high winds. 1 Introduction The NASA CyGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) is a constellation of eight microsatellites with the aim of improving hurricane intensity forecasts [ 1,2]. CyGNSS picks up the signals from global navigation system satellites such as GPS and BeiDou, scattered off the Earth’s surface. These reﬂected signals encode the ocean surface roughness, and thus the wind speed [ 3]. GNSS signals are only insigniﬁcantly affected by clouds and precipitation, and are thus suitable for remote sensing in adverse meteorological conditions [ 4]. CyGNSS covers tropical and subtropical regions (\u000635\u000elatitude) with an average revisit time of seven hours. The CyGNSS wind speed dataset will be useful to mitigate the effects of climate change. Like other extreme weather events, cyclones are expected to increase in frequency and intensity in a warming climate, requiring improved forecasts [ 5]. Offshore wind turbines are a major renewable energy source with a projected installation of 205 GW capacity in the coming 10years [ 6]. Global observations can help to better understand the relation between climate change, atmospheric conditions, and wind speed [ 7]. A wind atlas can be useful for identifying future offshore park locations [ 8]. Knowledge of extreme winds is beneﬁcial for turbine safety engineering [9]. The main measurement in GNSS reﬂectometry is the Delay Doppler map (DDM), a 2D data array mapping the cross-correlation power of the original and the reﬂected GNS signal across bins of time delay and Doppler frequency shift. Wind speed retrieval algorithms have been successfully developed for CyGNSS data [ 10]. However, the algorithms are still being evaluated for ﬁeld conditions and may contain undiscovered biases. Both for a previous mission with the TechDemoSat-1 satellite [ 11], as well as for CyGNSS [ 12,13], it has been demonstrated that a feed forward neural network can estimate wind speed better than the conventional retrieval approach [ 11]. Convolutional networks Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.have been used to extract features from DDMs [ 14]. The evaluation on a large CyGNSS test set showed potential for operational use, with challenges at predicting high wind speeds [15]. We propose CyGNSSnet, a deep learning framework to predict wind speed from CyGNSS observa- tional products using supervised learning. In this paper, we present our methodology and critically assess the performance of CyGNSSnet. Our focus is on extreme value prediction and potential operational use. 2 Methods 2.1 CyGNSS dataset We use version 2.1 of the CyGNSS data set [ 16], covering 1 January 2018 – 20 February 2019. To exclude low-quality samples, we ﬁlter samples with a set of conditions, for details, see Appendix A.1. We use the ﬁrst 215days ( 7:2\u0002106samples) for training, the following 75days ( 4:7\u0002106samples) for validation, and the remaining 127days ( 8:8\u0002106samples) as a blind test set. The wind speed distribution is comparable across the three datasets, and the good quality samples are clustered in time. For details see Appendix A.2. Each sample contains the bistatic radar cross section (BRCS) DDM [ 10,17], a 17 x 11 pixel 2D data array that is treated like an image. Besides ancillary parameters are provided that are related to the measurement geometry, satellite status, and features processed from DDMs. For CyGNSSnet, we select 10 ancillary parameters in a data-driven way, for details, see Appendix A.3 and Table S2. The global ocean wind speed labels for supervised learning are obtained from ERA5 reanalysis data [18] and interpolated to match the CyGNSS specular point coordinates. If samples are labeled with the same wind speed due to limited spatiotemporal resolution, we randomly select one of them for training. Note that this approach implicitly assumes that the wind speed is uniform over the entire spatial domain covered by the DDM. As a baseline for the evaluation of CyGNSSnet, we include wind speed predictions obtained by a conventional method, the Minimum Variance Estimator for fully developed seas [ 10\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
