Accurate pre- diction of cyclone formation and evolution is crucial for disaster risk reduction and response activities. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for cyclone prediction using graph neural networks (GNNs). The GNNs model wind flow patterns as edges between nodes, where each node represents a geographic loca- tion. The strength and direction of the wind flow between nodes are represented by the weight of the edges. We train the GNNs on historical data to understand the relationships between wind flow patterns and cyclone formation and develop- ment. The GNNs can then analyze the current state of the graph and forecast the formation, track, and intensity of future cyclones. Our proposed method offers a significant improvement over traditional models, which often fail to capture the intricate relationships between different atmospheric and oceanic areas. By utiliz- ing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we can model wind flow patterns as edges between nodes in a graph, thereby gaining a more comprehensive understanding of the entire atmospheric and oceanic system. Our approach is highly adaptable and can incorporate data from a wide range of sources, including satellites, re- mote sensing devices, and ground-based observations. Additionally, GNNs are versatile and flexible, allowing us to make modifications and updates as new data becomes available. While GNNs offer promising results for cyclone prediction, they are complex models that require relevant expertise to develop and train. Our proposed method presents a new and innovative approach to cyclone prediction that has the potential to significantly improve disaster risk reduction and response activities. Overall, we believe that our GNN-based method is a promising ap- proach to better predicting the formation and evolution of cyclones, and has the potential to greatly improve disaster response and risk reduction efforts. 1 I NTRODUCTION Hurricane, typhoon, or cyclone which is collectively known as Tropical Cyclone (TC) is one of the most common natural disasters around the world. Particularly the countries located in tropical âˆ— 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 and subtropical regions face TCs during pre-monsoon (March-May) and post-monsoon (October- December) seasons every year. Poorly built houses, lack of appropriate early warning systems, etc. make developing and underdeveloped countries much more vulnerable to TC than the developed world. This is the greatest disaster that affects the people living in these countries almost every year. Coastal flooding caused by cyclones causes severe damage to lives and property. Inundation followed by storm surges, destruction of communication systems, breakage of supply chains, etc. hinders cultivation and subsequently makes people starve and in many instances causes famine. The lack of appropriate advanced early warning systems is one of the main reasons that intensifies the disaster caused by TC. In Particular, the lead time for cyclone forecasts is very limited in developing countries for which different agencies and the people in the affected area fail to take necessary prepa- rations for upcoming storms. As an example, the lead time for TC forecasts used by the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD), the main government agency responsible for issuing forecasts for tropical cyclones and storm surges, is three days [1]. Cyclone prediction is necessary to avoid the loss of lives and limit the damage caused by cyclones. An advanced and sophisticated early warning system in cyclone-prone underdeveloped countries will not only save the precious life of the people but also will augment the economy of those coun- tries by avoiding damage and destruction caused by cyclones each year. The use of Artificial In- telligence (AI) has become a wide area of research in developing weather, climate, and disaster prediction which takes into account every detail of the factors to be considered for the prediction and reduces human errors to a great extent. The use of radar, satellites and much other sophisticated equipment has further enabled some of the developed countries to predict TC with a lead time of 15 days. The use of AI, in particular, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods will enable us to establish low-cost and efficient systems affordable by poor countries for TC prediction and forecasting. There are several numerical models and some machine learning and deep learning models are being used for cyclone track forecasting. Methodologically we have divided our work into four main parts: cyclone prediction system, cyclone track forecasting, cyclone intensity forecasting, and cyclone forecasting using deep learning and machine learning. 2 B ACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK A developing field of study is the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) to forecast cyclones.

Countries in tropical and subtropical regions face TCs during the pre-monsoon (March-May) and post-monsoon (October-December) seasons every year. Developing and underdeveloped countries are more vulnerable to TCs due to poorly built houses, lack of early warning systems, and other factors. Cyclones cause severe damage to lives and property, leading to coastal flooding, storm surges, destruction of communication systems, and disruption of supply chains, ultimately affecting cultivation and leading to famine.\n\nThe lack of advanced early warning systems is a significant reason for the intensification of the disaster caused by TCs. In developing countries, the lead time for cyclone forecasts is limited, making it challenging for agencies and people in affected areas to prepare for upcoming storms. For example, the Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) has a three-day lead time for TC forecasts. Cyclone prediction is essential to avoid loss of lives and limit damage caused by cyclones.\n\nAn advanced early warning system in cyclone-prone underdeveloped countries can save lives and augment the economy by avoiding damage and destruction caused by cyclones each year. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become a significant area of research in developing weather, climate, and disaster prediction, reducing human errors to a great extent. AI, particularly machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) methods, can enable the establishment of low-cost and efficient systems for TC prediction and forecasting.\n\nOur work is divided into four main parts: cyclone prediction system, cyclone track forecasting, cyclone intensity forecasting, and cyclone forecasting using deep learning and machine learning."
