However, existing approaches often rely on temporal analysis of shortwave-infrared spectra, assuming consistent ground conditions and prior knowledge of methane-free periods, which can lead to errors and limit scalability. To overcome these challenges, we present Methane SatMapper, an innovative end-to-end spectral transformer model specif- ically designed to accurately identify and quantify methane plumes. Our model introduces two novel modules: one that identifies potential methane emission sites by analyzing solar radiation absorption in the spectral domain and another that localizes and quantifies methane plumes without the need for temporal data. By utilizing all 12 spectral channels of Sentinel-2 imagery, our architecture effectively estimates ground terrain and detects methane emissions, providing enhanced ro- bustness to variable ground conditions and increased computational efficiency by eliminating the need for historical time-series data. Primary evaluations confirm that Methane SatMapper delivers precise and reliable methane detection, addressing key limitations in scalability and temporal dependence. 1 Introduction The increases in atmospheric CH 4have prompted governments to enact regulations and action plans such as the ‘U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan’ in 2021 and the ‘Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway’ in 2022 to curb CH 4emission [ 2,19]. Accurately identifying and tracking the contribution of various sources to the methane budget will be paramount to enforce these regulations. Given the strong potential of satellite-based instruments for data collection at high-frequency (multiple times a month) on global scales and even remote and hard-to-access regions, recent research has depicted the potential of deploying methane emissions analysis on public, global-mapping, multi- spectral instruments like the ESA Sentinel-2 mission [ 25,3,7,20,3]. With two polar-orbiting, sun- synchronous satellites, the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard the Sentinel-2 satellites measures the reflected radiance from Earth in multiple bands covering various areas of the electromagnetic spectrum [ 21]. Among these bands, band 11 ( ∼1500nm−1660nm) and band 12 ( ∼2090nm− 2290nm) are able to capture methane’s SWIR (Short Wave InfraRed) absorption features at a spatial resolution of 20m2, leading to a large breadth of work and studies on using Sentinel-2 data to detect and quantify methane emissions [ 25,29,11,6]. Most previous Sentinel-2-based methane Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.analysis approaches are based on the methane column retrieval method in [ 25]. While this method, and variations of it [ 6] have revolutionized capabilities of detecting methane emissions with public satellite data, the strong dependency on time-series analysis of spectral reflectance data expose the approaches to the risky assumptions of (a) knowing when emissions did not exist and (b) temporal albedo stability of the background. Consequently, these assumptions lead to high amounts of false positives, especially in areas with heterogeneous, temporally deviating land cover [25, 29]. To overcome shortcomings of time-series based methane analytics methods, we propose a deeper exploitation of signals from other non-methane-sensitive spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data. We use Beer-Lambert law to model the drop in intensity of light as it passes through a medium [ 5,25]. Building on the recent advancements in signal processing techniques and the successful application of Machine Learning models for methane emissions analysis [ 16], we propose a two-step methodology: (1) the generation of potential methane candidates using a Spectral Feature Generator (SFG), and (2) the integration of SFG into a Transformer-based Convolutional Neural Network architecture [ 4,9], as illustrated in Figure 1. Using the full spectral response captured by Sentinel-2 instruments, we expect the SFG to support Signal to Noise separation by classifying confusing and hard-to-detect land cover types, artifacts and temporal deviations, such as water bodies, dark green vegetation, calcite, and white painted roofs which are never considered in methods. 2 Related Work Over the past decade, several satellites such as GOSAT [ 28], OCO-2, and TROPOMI [ 27] have been launched to detect and quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel activities, enabling continuous monitoring of carbon dioxide and methane levels. The Sentinel-5P (TROPOMI) mission [ 27], for example, provides hyperspectral imagery in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectrum, where methane ( CH4) strongly absorbs light. This satellite offers daily measurements of CH4column mole fractions across the globe, although at a relatively low spatial resolution of 5−7km [20,23,1]. Standard retrieval algorithms estimate vertical column concentrations of atmospheric methane by fitting a radiative transfer model to remotely sensed SWIR spectra. These algorithms typically analyze highly resolved spectra with full-width at half-maximum\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
