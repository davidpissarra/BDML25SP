Physical models show that urban trees can signiﬁcantly reduce the diurnal temperature range [5], while empirical studies demonstrate that urban canopy cover have reduced peak summer air temperatures by up to 2.8◦C, 1.5◦C, 2.0◦C, and 2.7◦C in Campinas (Brazil), Singapore, Shanghai (China), and Freiburg (Germany) respectively [ 6–9]. Existing studies have established a direct relationship between high peak summer temperatures and critical health outcomes, such as hospital admissions [ 10,11], deaths [ 12–14], respiratory diseases and cardiovascular health [ 15,16]. High temperatures can also signiﬁcantly depress the economic growth of developing [ 17] and developed countries [ 18] by decreasing labor productivity and supply [ 19], and increasing political instability [17, 20]. Besides decreasing air temperature in cities, beneﬁts of trees and canopy cover in urban areas also include removal of air pollution [ 21], increased perceived neighborhood safety [ 22], and better visual and aesthetic appeal for residents [23, 24]. Challenges of quantifying canopy cover: Current methods to measure existing urban canopy cover remain inadequate. Traditional methods rely on either overhead imagery or in-person ﬁeldwork. High resolution overhead images are often costly to obtain, hence limiting most analysis to coarse resolutions [ 25,26]. Overhead imagery also cannot represent the street-level and resident perspectives of canopy cover [ 27]. In-person ﬁeldwork requires signiﬁcant man-hours to cover large urban areas [28]. First proposed by Yang et al. [27] and later used by Li et al. [29], the Green View Index (GVI) measures the street-level urban canopy cover by averaging percentage of canopy cover on a pixel- ∗Also afﬁliated with the Government Technology Agency of Singapore, Singapore 117438 Climate Change AI Workshop at NeurIPS(2019), Vancouver, Canada.level in street level images. Existing methods [ 29,30] that calculate GVI primarily relies on the original method of color thresholding and clustering to ﬁlter for possibly misidentiﬁed green specks. The GVI metric has proven to be applicable to other sources of street-level imagery, including Tencent Street View [ 31,32] and Baidu Street View [ 30], and also resulted in ﬁndings of relationships between the prevalence of urban greenery to neighborhood wealth [ 33], property prices [ 34], cycling and walking behaviors [ 35]. These subsequently discovered relationships underline the value of accurate analysis of urban canopy cover at large scales. Conversely, insufﬁcient quantiﬁcation of urban trees will decrease the effectiveness and fairness of publicly-funded urban greenery efforts. As demonstrated in Figure 3, existing \"threshold and cluster\" methods are prone to false positive detection of green objects that are not considered as vertical vegetation, or false negative detection of non-green parts of vertical vegetation such as branches and yellow leaves. Existing methods also validate their accuracy by calculating the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between manually labeled and calculated GVIs [ 29–32]. The Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient measures the strength of co-movements between manually labeled and calculated GVI values, but do not provide a direct measurement of difference between manually labeled and calculated GVI values and also do not capture the accuracy of located pixels of vertical vegetation [36]. 2 Dataset and Methods Dataset: We choose Cambridge (USA), Johannesburg (South Africa), Oslo (Norway), S /tildewideao Paulo (Brazil), and Singapore (Singapore) as cities included in our training and test sets.
