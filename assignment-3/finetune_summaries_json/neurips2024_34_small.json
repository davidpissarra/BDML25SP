Moreover, the current landscape of disparate data sources and inconsistent weighting method- ologies exacerbates the reproducibility crisis and undermines scientific integrity. To address these issues, we have developed a globally comprehensive dataset at both country (GADM0) and region (GADM1) levels, encompassing various cli- mate indicators (precipitation, temperature, SPEI, wind gust). Our methodology involves weighting gridded climate data by population density, night-time light intensity, cropland area, and concurrent population count – all proxies for socio- economic activity – before aggregation. We process data from multiple sources, offering daily, monthly, and annual climate variables spanning from 1900 to 2023. A unified framework streamlines our preprocessing steps, and rigorous valida- tion against leading climate impact studies ensures data reliability. The resulting Weighted Climate Dataset is publicly accessible through an online dashboard at https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/. 1 Background & Motivation Climate change is a major driver of economic and social challenges [ 1,2]. Although research has documented its impacts on agriculture [ 3], economic production [ 4–6], conflict [ 7], income inequality [8], mortality [ 9], and energy consumption [ 10], a critical data gap persists. Climate data are often available at high resolutions (daily or hourly) and gridded formats, while socio-economic data are typically collected annually and associated with administrative units like regions or countries. To bridge this gap, researchers typically aggregate weather data to match the lower resolution of socio- economic data. However, this aggregation can be misleading if not done with care. Simply averaging weather data across a region can mask important spatial heterogeneity. For example, average summer temperatures in the Mojave Desert may be much higher than Los Angeles, but socio-economic activity is concentrated in Los Angeles. So, labor productivity in California is likely more affected by temperatures in Los Angeles than in the desert. Therefore, researchers are increasingly using spatially weighted climate data to account for the varying distribution of socio-economic activities within a ∗These authors contributed equally.

Weighting schemes such as population density can be used to prioritize areas with higher socio-economic activity when averaging weather data. Despite the benefits, replicating studies using weighted climate data can be difficult. The specific weighting procedures used are often poorly documented or absent entirely in existing research. This lack of a transparent, standardized, documented, and open access source for spatially weighted climate data can lead to biased results, as the choice of weighting methodology can significantly impact analysis, hindering accurate and robust estimation of climate impacts [ 11]. This paper, by extending a previously published version [ 12], addresses this gap by introducing the Weighted Climate Dataset, a unified source of data that preprocesses and weights gridded climate data. We also provide a user-friendly interface at https://weightedclimatedata.streamlit.app/ in order to explore and download ready-to-use, spatially weighted climate variables at national and sub-national levels for the period 1900-2023. This promotes: •Replicability: Improved documentation and transparency in data processing; •Efficiency: Saves researchers time and resources by providing pre-processed data; •Robustness: Encourages testing the sensitivity of estimates to weighting choices. By facilitating access to a standardized dataset, we aim to enhance the climate impact assessment community’s work and encourage robust and replicable research. 2 The Weighted Climate Dataset Figure 1 outlines the construction of our dataset. We integrate gridded climate data from multiple open-access sources with gridded socio-economic indicators and administrative boundaries. Our methodology enables users to customize the weighting of climate data by various socio-economic factors to suit their specific research needs. 2.1 Sources Climate Data. We incorporate raw gridded climate data from four established datasets commonly employed in climate impact research: Climate Research Unit Time-Series [ 13] (CRU TS v4.07), 2available from 1901 to 2022; Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas [ 14] (CSIC v2.7), spanning 1901 to 2020; ECMWF Reanalysis v5 [ 15] (ERA5), covering 1940 to 2023; and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
