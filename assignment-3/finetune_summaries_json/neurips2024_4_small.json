Google’s Solar API aids this transition by estimating solar potential from aerial imagery, but its impact is constrained by geographical coverage. This paper proposes expanding the API’s reach using satellite imagery, enabling global solar potential assessment. We tackle challenges involved in building a Digital Surface Model (DSM) and roof instance segmentation from lower resolution and single oblique views using deep learning models. Our models, trained on aligned satellite and aerial datasets, produce 25cm DSMs and roof segments. With ~1m DSM MAE on buildings, ~5◦roof pitch error and ~56% IOU on roof segmentation, they signiﬁcantly enhance the Solar API’s potential to promote solar adoption. 1 Introduction Google Maps Platform Solar API [Google, 2024] aims to increase the speed and depth of rooftop solar photo-voltaic roll-out by accurately estimating the solar potential of all suitable buildings worldwide using high quality aerial imagery. Since its release, we estimate that Solar API has been used in over 1 million residential solar projects in US, Europe and Japan. Previous work [Goroshin et al., 2023] demonstrated the potential of such mapping with lower quality aerial imagery in the US and parts of Europe increasing data coverage by 10x over high quality aerial coverage. With satellite imagery, Solar API has the potential to increase its coverage by a further 1B buildings, focusing on the global south (20+ countries across South America, Asia, Africa, Australia and Europe). This expansion represents a further 10x increase in potential area coverage over high quality aerial imagery and enables a higher refresh rate to assess changes in solar potential over time. Accurate rooftop geometry and shading analysis are crucial for the Solar API pipeline, which relies on precise Digital Surface Models (DSMs) and roof segmentation. We propose training deep learning models to predict DSMs and roof segments from satellite imagery, using high-quality aerial imagery as labels. Our method addresses challenges inherent in satellite data, such as lower resolution, oblique angles, and temporal discrepancies compared to aerial labels. Building on prior work [Goroshin et al., 2023], we demonstrate the potential of Solar API to enhance global solar potential assessment, advancing the transition to sustainable energy. Recent advances in DSM estimation such as [Panagiotou et al., 2020], [Stucker and Schindler, 2022], [Kunwar, 2019], have made signiﬁcant strides, but often overlook ﬁne-grained roof geometry detail which is crucial for solar design. While NeRF-based approaches [Marí et al., 2022] offer compelling 3D reconstructions, their multi-view requirement limits scalability.

This paper introduces solutions aimed at enhancing DSM estimation and achieving precise instance-level roof segmentation from satellite imagery, thereby facilitating effective solar design. 2 Data 2.1 Inputs, labels and pre-processing Inputs comprise off-nadir satellite (Pleiades Neo [ESA, 2024]) RGB at 30cm resolution along with optional photogrammetry derived DSMs and DTMs (plane sweep stereo [Collins, 1996] with graph cut optimization [Boykov et al., 2001]) computed from a stack of satellite imagery wherever available. These photogrammetry-derived DSMs (even when present) often lack the necessary roof detail required, so we propose enhancements on top. Labels comprise high quality nadir aerial RGB and corresponding DSMs + DTMs computed via photogrammetry for the DSM estimation task. We compute building instances from the imagery using the a high-quality building detection model [Sirko et al., 2021]. We then run graph cut [Boykov et al., 2001] on the DSMs within each building to produce (somewhat noisy) roof segment labels [Goroshin et al., 2023] for the roof segment prediction task. We then use simple geometry to reproject the labels into the view frame of each satellite image (see section A.2). Lastly we compute a few masks: Building presence/consistency masks are computed by comparing satellite and label imagery detected buildings. Similarly, roof segment consistency masks are generated by comparing label roof segments and building instances\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
