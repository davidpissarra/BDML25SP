Weather scientists have been developing super-resolution (SR) methods to increase the resolution, but often rely on simple interpolation techniques or computationally expensive differential equation-based models. Recently, machine learning-based models, speciﬁcally the physics-informed resolution-enhancing generative adversarial network (PhIREGAN), have outperformed traditional downscaling methods. We provide a thorough and extensible benchmark of leading deep learning-based super-resolution techniques, including the enhanced super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) and an enhanced deep super-resolution (EDSR) network, on wind and solar data. We accompany the benchmark with a novel public, processed, and machine learning-ready dataset for benchmarking super-resolution methods on wind and solar data. 1 Introduction In the United States, the national Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that renewable energy, predomi- nantly wind and solar power, will contribute 42% of the country’s electricity generation by 2050 [ 1]. To achieve this goal, operational decision-makers must integrate forecasting models into local power systems to address the spatial variability of these clean energy forms. However, current climate simulations used to obtain high-resolution data are unable to resolve the spatial characteristics necessary for accurate future local energy assessments, as increasing their spatial resolution is computationally expensive and provides insufﬁcient accuracy [ 2]. Numerical weather predictions (NWPs) provide short-term climatological forecasting data at a horizontal resolution of 10 to 20-km [ 3,4,5], while energy planning requires wind and solar data at a smaller, more local scale, on the order of 2-km [6]. In the ﬁeld of computer vision, researchers enhance the resolution of a data ﬁeld through single-image super-resolution [7]. Although the problem of super-resolution is inherently ill-posed—coarsened low-resolution (LR) input data can map to inﬁnitely many high-resolution (HR) outputs—machine learning-based approaches offer a computationally efﬁcient method of generating the high-resolution data needed to predict the effect climate has on power generation [8, 9, 10]. Super-resolution techniques have increasingly been applied to climate data in recent years [ 11,9,12,13]. As these methods have the potential to outperform traditional spatial SR for wind and solar predictions[ 14,15], it is important to rigorously validate them to ensure that their SR outputs are accurate and realistic. In this work we contribute: \u0003These authors contributed equally•an extensible benchmark for determining accurate and physically consistent super-resolution models for wind and solar data; •a novel application of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)- and generative adversarial network (GAN)-based super-resolution techniques to a task from the physical sciences; •and a novel publicly available machine learning-ready dataset for the super-resolution of wind speeds and solar irradiance ﬁelds. 2 Data The training data was obtained from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s (NREL’s) Wind Integration National Database (WIND) Toolkit and the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB), with a focus on the continental United States. Wind velocity data is comprised of westward (ua) and southward (va) wind components, calculated from wind speeds and directions 100-m from Earth’s surface. The WIND Toolkit has a spatial resolution of 2km\u00021hr spatiotemporal resolution [ 16,17,18,19]. Our wind dataset contains data sampled at a 4-hourly temporal resolution (every fourth data point) for the years 2007 to 2013. Wind test data are sampled at a 4-hourly temporal resolution for the year 2014. Additionally, we consider solar irradiance data from the NSRDB in terms of direct normal irradiance (DNI) and diffused horizontal irradiance (DHI) at an approximately 4km\u00021=2hrspatiotemporal resolution [ 20]. The solar dataset produced for this work samples data at an hourly temporal resolution from 6 am to 6 pm for the years 2007 to 2013. Solar test data are sampled at an hourly temporal resolution (every other data point) from 6 am to 6 pm for the years 2014 to 2018. More information about the wind and solar datasets is available in the Appendix. 3 Models We examined ﬁve super-resolution techniques—PhIREGAN [ 21], ESRGAN [ 22], EDSR [ 23], SR CNN, and bicubic interpolation—on their ability to perform 5 \u0002spatial super-resolution, e.g., 10-km to 2-km spatial resolution, on wind and solar data ﬁelds.
