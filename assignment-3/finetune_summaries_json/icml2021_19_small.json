We train a modiﬁed Faster R-CNN object detection model to detect individ- ual CVs in satellite images and feed the resulting counts into a regression model to predict hourly CV trafﬁc rates. This architecture, when trained on ground-truth data for Switzerland, is able to estimate hourly CV trafﬁc rates for any freeway section within 58% (MAPE) of the actual value; for freeway sections with historic information on CV trafﬁc rates, we can predict hourly CV trafﬁc rates up to within 4% (MAPE). We successfully apply our model to freeway sections in other coun- tries and show-case its utility by quantifying the change in trafﬁc patterns as a result of the ﬁrst COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. Our results show that it is possible to estimate hourly CV traf- ﬁc rates from satellite images, which can guide civil engineers and policy makers, especially in developing countries, in monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from CV trafﬁc. 1.

Road freight, which currently accounts for more than 7% of the annual global CO 2emissions (IEA, 2021; 2019), will remain the dominant mode of surface freight transporta- tion (Eurostat, 2018) in the near future, likely leading to even higher emissions, as carbon-neutral solutions for heavy modes of transportion have not yet matured (ITF, 2021). Ground-based trafﬁc measurement systems provide quanti- tative information on the rate and composition of trafﬁc for a given location. Such information is required by civil engi- neers, policy-makers and other stakeholders for road plan- ning and the implementation of road emission regulations. Switzerland, with its dense road network, has over 500 of such systems in operation, which monitor trafﬁc rates 24/7, while simultaneously categorizing all passing vehicles into ten different vehicle size classes (Bundesamt f ¨ur Strassen ASTRA, 2009). However, such a dense ground-based de- tection system is costly in installation and maintenance and thus often unavailable in developing countries, where much of the growth in CV trafﬁc is occurring (Kaack et al., 2018). The use of remote imaging data, as provided by the Euro- pean Copernicus Programme and its two Sentinel-2 satel- lites, may be utilized to estimate hourly CV trafﬁc rates. CVs and other vehicles are typically too small to be spa- tially resolved in Sentinel-2 images. However, CVs of a sufﬁcient size and velocity ( \u001570km/h) generate a charac-Commercial Vehicle Trafﬁc Detection from Satellite Imagery with Deep Learning Figure 2.

This work tries to tackle the missing trafﬁc census in many parts of the world by combining satellite images with deep learning. The goal is to facilitate a new automated monitoring technique to quantify CV trafﬁc rates anywhere in the world. CV trafﬁc monitoring enables stakeholders to improve road planning and enforce environmental protection regulations to monitor and minimize greenhouse gas emissions from CV trafﬁc, and to identify illegal industrial operations (log- ging, mining, waste dumps...). Additionally, the data can be utilized for economic analyses, such as the tracking of transportion routes. 2.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nThe paper presents a method to estimate hourly commercial vehicle (CV) traffic rates from freely available Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. A modified Faster R-CNN object detection model is trained to detect individual CVs in satellite images, and the resulting counts are fed into a regression model to predict hourly CV traffic rates. The architecture, trained on ground-truth data for Switzerland, achieves an accuracy of 58% (MAPE) for estimating hourly CV traffic rates for any freeway section. For freeway sections with historic information on CV traffic rates, the model can predict hourly CV traffic rates with an accuracy of up to 4% (MAPE). The model is successfully applied to freeway sections in other countries and is used to quantify the change in traffic patterns as a result of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland.\n\nThe results show that it is possible to estimate hourly CV traffic rates from satellite images, which can guide civil engineers and policymakers, especially in developing countries, in monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from CV traffic.\n\nThe increasing demand for international parcel shipping through e-commerce and other effects has led to a significant increase in parcel shipping volume, which is expected to double within the next five years. Road freight currently accounts for more than 7% of the annual global CO2 emissions and will remain the dominant mode of surface freight transportation in the near future. Ground-based traffic measurement systems provide quantitative information on the rate and composition of traffic for a given location, but are costly to install and maintain, making them unavailable in many developing countries.\n\nThe use of remote imaging data from the European Copernicus Programme and its two Sentinel-2 satellites may be used to estimate hourly CV traffic rates. CVs and other vehicles generate a characteristic pattern due to the temporal offset between different bands during imaging, which facilitates their detection. This work aims to tackle the missing traffic census in many parts of the world by combining satellite images with deep learning.\n\nThe goal is to facilitate a new automated monitoring technique to quantify CV traffic rates anywhere in the world. CV traffic monitoring enables stakeholders to improve road planning and enforce environmental protection regulations to monitor and minimize greenhouse gas emissions from CV traffic, and to identify illegal industrial operations. The data can also be used for economic analyses, such as tracking transportation routes.\n\nDeep learning techniques have been successfully applied to remote sensing data to identify various objects, including buildings, construction sites, military facilities, oil tanks, and tree crowns. However, the task of identifying CVs in satellite images is more challenging due to their small size and the need to detect them in a timely manner.\n\nThe proposed method uses a modified Faster R-CNN object detection model to detect CVs in satellite images and a regression model to predict hourly CV traffic rates. The model is trained on ground-truth data for Switzerland and achieves high accuracy in estimating hourly CV traffic rates for various freeway sections.\n\nThe results of the study show that the proposed method can be used to estimate hourly CV traffic rates from satellite images, which can guide civil engineers and policymakers in monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from CV traffic. The method can also be used to quantify the change in traffic patterns as a result of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland.\n\nThe proposed method has the potential to facilitate a new automated monitoring technique to quantify CV traffic rates anywhere in the world. This can help to improve road planning and enforce environmental protection regulations to monitor and minimize greenhouse gas emissions from CV traffic, and to identify illegal industrial operations.
