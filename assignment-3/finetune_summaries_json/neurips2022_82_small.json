Alopex, a stochastic correlative learning algorithm, is used to find optimal temperature and precipitation maps that best predict a given year. These maps are compared over multiple years to show how temperature and precipitations patterns indicative of each year change over time. 1 Introduction Deep networks have been used successfully to model many complex relationships in data from a wide variety of domains. Both practice and theory suggest that large, deep networks may generalize better to untrained data samples. This leads to important questions regarding the interpretability of such large networks to understand the limitations and trustworthiness of these models. In many studies involving measurements of the natural world, domain experts are most familiar with simple statistical analysis, such as linear regression. Therefore, to simplify the interpretability and trust of models, models that are simple extensions of linear models should be the first step. Here we follow this suggestion in an attempt to find indicators of climate change using a simple two-hidden layer neural network trained on global temperatures and precipitations from the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project [ 1] (CMIP6). The potential of discovering indicators of climate change from the previous CMIP5 data was demonstrated by Barnes, et al., [2,3] who found that linear models map global temperature data to year quite well and a simplified interpretation of the models was performed by analyzing the resulting linear model weights. In follow-on work, they recast the regression problem as a classification task in order to use Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to identify spatial patterns significant to classifying specific decades [ 4]. Here we return to the regression approach and extend it by including temperature and precipitation CMIP6 data and modeling it with a neural network having two hidden layers. A correlative learning algorithm is then applied to interpret what our neural network has learned about how temperatures and precipitations change over the years. In Section 2, a brief summary of local and global methods for interpreting what a neural network has learned are reviewed. Alopex is described as a global method. This is followed by a demonstration of the Alopex method by using it to interpret what a neural network has learned when trained on the MNIST data. This same approach is then applied in Section 3 to a neural network trained to predict Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Input images generated by Alopex that maximize the likelihood of each digit. The images are averages of the final images from 20 repetitions of the Alopex algorithm. the year from global temperature and precipitation data, revealing intriguing changes in this data over time. 2 Interpretation of Neural Network Models Interpretability methods aim to convey information about a network’s learning process and decision making. These methods largely fall in two categories, namely local and global. Local explanations provide insight on individual predictions. For example, saliency maps show certain pixels for a given sample with a positive saliency that increase accuracy in the prediction [ 5]. Further, methods such as LRP [ 6], DeepLift [ 7], and Gradient*Input [ 8] aim to provide pixel-wise relevance. In many cases these methods are mathematically equivalent (i.e., network’s with ReLU activations or zero valued baselines) [9] and are cumbersome to reason about over a large set of data. Global methods describe the general behavior of a network where explanations are made on a class of predictions or network components. Most common for neural networks are methods to understand high-level concepts (e.g., color or texture sensitivity) [ 10], visualizing maximal neuron or layer activations [ 11], or optimizing an input to maximize the probability of an output [ 5]. In this work, we focus on finding an optimal input that generalizes to individual outputs. Both local and global methods that are gradient-free do exist (e.g., computing surrogate models as done with LIME [ 12] or Shapley value-based feature importance [ 13]). However, the majority of these methods rely on backpropagating gradients through the network (including [ 11,5]). Here we introduce Alopex as a global interpretaton method that does not rely on gradients. Specifically, we leverage local correlations between changes in input features and changes in the global error function to produce a global view on a class of predictions.
