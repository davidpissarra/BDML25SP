Our work investigates the challenge of optimal placement of such trees. Physical simulations can estimate the radiative and thermal impact of trees on human thermal comfort but induce high computational costs. This rules out optimization of tree placements over large areas and considering effects over longer time scales. Hence, we employ neural networks to simulate the point-wise mean radiant temperatures–a driving factor of outdoor human thermal comfort–across various time scales, spanning from daily variations to extended time scales of heatwave events and even decades. To optimize tree placements, we harness the innate local effect of trees within the iterated local search framework with tailored adaptations. We show the efficacy of our approach across a wide spectrum of study areas and time scales. We believe that our approach is a step towards empowering decision-makers, urban designers and planners to proactively and effectively assess the potential of urban trees to mitigate heat stress. 1 Introduction Climate change will have profound implications on many aspects of our lives, ranging from the quality of outdoor environments and biodiversity, to the safety and well-being of the human populace [United Nations, 2023]. Particularly noteworthy is the observation that densely populated urban regions, typically characterized by high levels of built and sealed surfaces, face an elevated exposure and vulnerability to heat stress, which in turn raises the risk of mortality during heatwaves [Gabriel and Endlicher, 2011]. The mean radiant temperature ( Tmrt,°C) is one of the main factors affecting daytime outdoor human thermal comfort [Holst and Mayer, 2011, Kántor and Unger, 2011, Cohen et al., 2012].1High Tmrtcan negatively affect human health [Mayer et al., 2008] and Tmrthas a higher correlation with mortality than air temperature [Thorsson et al., 2014]. Consequently, climate- sensitive urban planning should try to lower maximum Tmrtas a suitable climate adaption strategy to enhance (or at least maintain) current levels of outdoor human thermal comfort. Among the array of climate adaption strategies considered for mitigation of adverse urban thermal conditions, urban greening, specifically urban trees, has garnered significant attention due to their numerous benefits, including a reduction of Tmrt, transpirative cooling, air quality [Nowak et al., 2006], and aesthetic appeal [Lindemann-Matthies and Brieger, 2016]. Previous studies found the strong 1Tmrtis introduced in more detail in Appendix A.

However, these works were limited by the computational cost of physical models, which rendered the optimization of tree placements over large areas or long time scales infeasible. On the other hand, there has been increased interest in machine learning for climate science [Rolnick et al., 2022]. However, previous work mostly focused on efficiency gains [Briegel et al., 2023, Huang and Hoefler, 2023], raised climate awareness [Schmidt et al., 2022], improved the analytical capabilities [Albert et al., 2017, Blanchard et al., 2022, Teng et al., 2023, Otness et al., 2023], or used it for urban planning [Shen et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2020, 2021, 2023, Zheng et al., 2023]. Our work deviates from these prior works, as it directly optimizes a meteorological quantity (Tmrt) that correlates well with heat stress experienced by humans (outdoor human thermal comfort). In this work, we present a simple, scalable yet effective optimization approach for positioning trees in urban districts to facilitate climate-sensitive urban planning to adapt to climate change in cities.2 We use the iterated local search framework [\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
