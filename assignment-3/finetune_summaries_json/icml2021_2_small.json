Since little to no public data is available to develop such contrail detectors, we construct and release a dataset of several thousand Landsat-8 scenes with pixel-level annotations of contrails. The dataset will continue to grow, but currently contains 4289 scenes (of which 47% have at least one contrail) representing 950+ person-hours of labeling time. 1. Introduction Contrails are cirrus clouds caused by jet aircraft which, by trapping outgoing infrared radiation, are likely avia- tion’s largest contribution to global warming (Burkhardt & Karcher, 2011; Chen & Gettelman, 2013; Schumann et al., 2015; Boucher et al., 2014; Bock & Burkhardt, 2016; Bickel et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). Contrails are started by jet engine exhaust, which contains both water vapor and soot. If the surrounding air is cold and humid enough (Ap- pleman, 1953), the water vapor condenses and freezes into ice clouds, using the soot particles as nucleation sites. The lifespan of these clouds depends strongly on the ambient humidity level. With low humidity, the ice crystals rapidly (in seconds or minutes) sublimate away or never even form, but with higher relative humidity contrails can persist for hours. While relevant jet engine soot regulation (Jacob & Rindlisbacher, 2019) as well as hydrogen or electric aircraft are on the horizon, these mitigations are likely decades away from comprehensive impact.

This provides an opportunity to signiﬁcantly reduce global warming by diverting that subset of ﬂights a short distance vertically or laterally. Although diversions may sometimes increase fuel burn and associated emissions, these negative effects are estimated to be more than offset by the reduction in contrail radiative forcing (RF) (Avila et al., 2019; Teoh et al., 2020). 2. Context and related work In order to divert aircraft to avoid creating warming con- trails, one needs to be able to predict which ﬂights will create them. Models for this, such as CoCIP and APCEMM (Schumann, 2012; Fritz et al., 2020) explicitly model the microphysics and radiative transfer effects of individual con- trails from formation to dissipation, depending on input data such as the estimated aircraft fuel burn rate (i.e. the jet exhaust quantity and qualities) and ambient weather condi- tions. The physics are fairly well established, but the inputs are subject to uncertainties from multiple sources. These uncertainties - including the spatial resolution of numerical weather models and limitations of high-altitude humidity measurements (Gierens et al., 2020) - have resulted in fairly large error bars on contrail RF estimates from simulations (Lee et al., 2021; Sanz-Mor `ere et al., 2020). Empirical analysis of contrails in satellite imagery also comes with uncertainty, stemming from the fundamental physical and visual similarity between contrails and natu- rally occurring cirrus clouds - and the absence of satellite orbits that can yield both high spatial and high temporal reso- lution imagery simultaneously. Contrail detection in satellite imagery for the last two decades has largely been accom- plished with the algorithm of Mannstein et al (Mannstein et al., 1999; Meyer et al., 2002; Palikonda et al., 2005; Minnis et al., 2005; Meyer et al., 2007; Vazquez-Navarro et al., 2010; Duda et al., 2013). This algorithm is a series of hand-engineered convolution and thresholding operations that operate on brightness temperature imagery, followed by identifying linear connected components of appropriate size. It has been tuned to have either high Precision or high Recall in contrail detections but a single model has not achieved both simultaneously, necessitating wide lower-bound/upper- bound approaches in empirical measurements of contrailA human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset coverage (Duda et al., 2013). One notable exception to the use of the Mannstein et al algorithm is (Kulik, 2019; Mei- jer et al., 2021) which trained a deep learning model for pixel-level contrail detection on GOES-16 satellite imagery.

Since little public data is available to develop such contrail detectors, we created and released a dataset of several thousand Landsat-8 scenes with pixel-level annotations of contrails. The dataset will continue to grow, but currently contains 4289 scenes (47% of which have at least one contrail) representing 950+ hours of labeling time.\n\nContrails are cirrus clouds caused by jet aircraft, which contribute significantly to global warming (Burkhardt & Karcher, 2011; Chen & Gettelman, 2013; Schumann et al., 2015; Boucher et al., 2014; Bock & Burkhardt, 2016; Bickel et al., 2020; Lee et al., 2021). They are formed by jet engine exhaust, which contains water vapor and soot. If the surrounding air is cold and humid enough, the water vapor condenses and freezes into ice clouds, using the soot particles as nucleation sites. The lifespan of these clouds depends strongly on the ambient humidity level. With low humidity, the ice crystals rapidly sublimate away or never form, but with higher relative humidity, contrails can persist for hours.\n\nWhile regulations on jet engine soot and alternative aircraft technologies are being developed, these mitigations are likely decades away from having a comprehensive impact. Recent simulations indicate that a small percentage of contrails are responsible for the vast majority of contrail warming. This provides an opportunity to significantly reduce global warming by diverting flights a short distance vertically or laterally.
