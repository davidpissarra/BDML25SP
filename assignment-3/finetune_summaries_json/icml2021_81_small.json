Super resolution deep learning is, therefore, an essential tool to improve spatial resolution of dynamic CT images.

For example, CO 2 can replace water in hydraulic fracturing processes while simultaneously sequestering, creating a reduced-carbon or carbon negative energy process (Middleton et al., 2015; Pruess, 2006). Injected CO 2tends to ﬂow preferentially through naturally existing or induced fractures. CO 2and brine mixtures are quite acidic. The low pH brine chemically interacts with surface minerals along fractures, altering rock-ﬂuid interac- tions through dissolution and precipitation of certain rock minerals. Such reactions can signiﬁcantly impact the poros- ity and permeability along the fractures and near-fracture matrix, affecting both CO 2ﬂow and storage processes. Visu- alization techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, capture alterations of fractures during reactive transport experiments at the laboratory scale. CT is an important technique to image rocks during dynamic transport experiments. The resolution of CT images, how- ever, is insufﬁcient to characterize accurately the changes in fractures and rock matrix porosity on the order of \u0016m or less. Micro-CT ( \u0016CT) scanners have the necessary superior resolution to characterize reactive transport processes at the microscale. The scan time of \u0016CT is longer than that of a CT by at least an order of magnitude and therefore limits the temporal resolution signiﬁcantly. To overcome these challenges, we propose to image dy- namic reactive transport using CT scanners and later upsam- ple the CT image to have comparable resolution to \u0016CT. Dong et al. (2015) shows that deep convolutional neural net- works (CNN) are state of the art superior methods for image super resolution tasks. Past literature reports supervised su- per resolution deep learning models based on micro-CT and synthetically downsampled micro-CT image pairs for geo- logical samples (Wang et al., 2019; Da Wang et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). Low-resolution CT images are more applicable inputs to super resolution deep learning models due to the widespread use of CT in geoscience. The avail- ability of CT and micro-CT imaging capability motivates us to train CNN models with low resolution CT as input im- ages and high-resolution micro-CT as ground truth images.

Subsurface geology provides large-scale solutions to our climate goals through technologies such as CO2 utilization and sequestration, subsurface hydrogen and compressed air storage, and enhanced geothermal systems. For example, CO2 can replace water in hydraulic fracturing processes while simultaneously sequestering, creating a reduced-carbon or carbon-negative energy process (Middleton et al., 2015; Pruess, 2006). Injected CO2 tends to flow preferentially through naturally existing or induced fractures. CO2 and brine mixtures are quite acidic, and the low pH brine chemically interacts with surface minerals along fractures, altering rock-fluid interactions through dissolution and precipitation of certain rock minerals. Such reactions can significantly impact the porosity and permeability along the fractures and near-fracture matrix, affecting both CO2 flow and storage processes.\n\nVisualization techniques, such as Computed Tomography (CT) imaging, capture alterations of fractures during reactive transport experiments at the laboratory scale.
