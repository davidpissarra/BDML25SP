The main motivation of presented work was to evaluate if machine learning techniques could help to understand and anticipate hypoxic episodes in nutrient-impacted estuaries, a phenomenon that is exacerbated by increasing temperature expected to arise due to changes in climate. A major constraint of the analysis was limiting ourselves to a single variable, the dissolved oxygen time series. Our preliminary ﬁndings show that recurring neural networks, and in particular LSTM, may be capable of predicting short horizon levels while traditional analyses are adequate for longer range hypoxia prevention. 1 Introduction Nutrient loading to waterways is increasing worldwide due to anthropogenic activities, speciﬁcally increased land-use, agriculture, industry and animal waste. As a result, simple algal species capable of outcompeting vascular plants for nutrients and space become dominant, i.e., the addition of otherwise limiting nutrients results in a eutrophic environment. There are myriad consequences to this change as both habitat and water quality decline and in severe cases can result in mass mortality of fauna. Given that eutrophication is a process and is on a continuum, it is imperative to identify where a particular system is on this continuum. Dissolved oxygen (DO) has proven effective at delineating trophic status of estuaries and is a key component of ecosystem function, as it reﬂects oxygen production through photosynthesis, oxygen consumption through respiration (including decomposition of organic matter), is critical for animal health, and its absence (anoxia) is a telltale symptom of a eutrophic environment. Unfortunately, “there is no other environmental variable of such ecological importance to coastal ecosystems that has changed so drastically in such a short period of time as a result of human activities as dissolved oxygen” [ 7]. Further, projected increases in temperature are a harbinger of increased hypoxic/anoxic episodes as dissolved oxygen solubility declines with temperature, not to mention increased oxygen demand as metabolism increases concomitantly. Instruments for monitoring dissolved oxygen optically are relatively inexpensive and accurately record data without drift. While most eutrophication monitoring programs rely on a suite of environmental indicators, analysis of high Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.frequency dissolved oxygen time series data provides a more parsimonious approach and comparable accuracy for nutrient impacted estuaries and bays in Atlantic Canada [ 2]. The analytical tools used for dissolved oxygen time-series data thus far have involved substantial data loss through the establishment of biologically relevant metrics that reﬂect symptoms of eutrophication, i.e., “high” or “low” oxygen [ 1]. This prior approach was prescriptive but was only useful for classifying the status of estuaries and bays at an annual time-step and was therefore insufﬁcient for predicting future dissolved oxygen conditions at any temporal scale. Herein we apply Machine Learning to model DO evolution over time and evaluate if models are capable of anticipating anoxia. For developing nations in particular, this methodology presents a potentially powerful tool for predicting water quality in nutrient-impacted environments enabling proactive decision-making towards sustainable ﬁsheries. 2 Data Exploration The study utilized optical dissolved oxygen loggers installed in multiple Atlantic Canada estuaries to collect hourly oxygen data from early July to late September.
