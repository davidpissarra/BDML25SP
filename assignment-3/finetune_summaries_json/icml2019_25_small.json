We developed an LSTM- based model trained by previous years to distin- guish corn and soybean for the current year. The results showed that LSTM outperformed random forest baseline in both in-season and end-of-the- season crop type classiﬁcation. The improved performance is a result of the cumulative effect of remote sensing information that has been learned by LSTM model structure.

Introduction Climate change is affecting agricultural land use in a com- plicated manner. According to the ﬁfth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a temperature rise of 3 to 4\u000eC is projected in cropland dominated areas by the year 2100 (Stocker et al., 2013). Crop production and food supply are extremely vulnerable to the changes in climate factors caused by global warming (Nelson et al., 2009; Vermeulen et al., 2012).

To understand the cropping pattern changes and estimate the potential socio-economic impact, monitoring changes of cropland use at a high spatiotemporal scale are greatly needed. Extracting general features from historical data and gener- ating near-real-time crop maps are of great signiﬁcance for estimating the impact of climate change on crop yield and early warning of extreme weather events. Remote sensing with machine learning technology provides a viable option for crop classiﬁcation. Existing methods have achieved considerable success in many applications depending on pre-deﬁned feature crafting and general classiﬁers such as random forest (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) (L¨ow et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2014; Waldner et al., 2015; Shi & Yang, 2016). Considering real-world applications, im- plementing accurate and timely crop mapping using satellite imagery across years remains a scientiﬁc challenge (Zhong et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019). Many existing modeling and non-temporal algorithms are hardly capable of captur- ing complicated temporal links from multi-temporal remote sensing data and adapting to interannual variability which is even greater due to accelerated climate change. An efﬁ- cient classiﬁer is required to model the cumulative effect in the dynamic response of crops to the environment, which represents unique growth features. Thus, a data-driven deep learning based approach is suggested to learn general pat- terns from past years and distinguish the crop classes for the current year in the early season. We present a long short-term memory (LSTM) based ap- proach to identify crop types at a scalable spatiotemporal scale in this study. Introduced by Hochreiter and Schmid- huber (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997), LSTM units are a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNN), which al- lows exhibiting long-term temporal dynamic dependencies from sequence data. Considering that individual phenolog- ical proﬁles of crop types are relatively consistent across years (Zhong et al., 2014), extracting long-term cumulative information from multi-temporal data may model crop vege- tation cycles.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nTemporal remote sensing data and adapting to interannual variability are crucial for crop monitoring. We developed an LSTM-based model trained on previous years' data to distinguish between corn and soybean for the current year. The results showed that LSTM outperformed the random forest baseline in both in-season and end-of-season crop type classification. The improved performance is due to the cumulative effect of remote sensing information learned by the LSTM model structure. This work provides a valuable opportunity for estimating the impact of climate change on crop yield and early warning of extreme weather events in the future.\n\nClimate change is affecting agricultural land use in a complex manner. According to the IPCC's fifth assessment report, a temperature rise of 3 to 4°C is projected in cropland-dominated areas by 2100. Crop production and food supply are extremely vulnerable to changes in climate factors caused by global warming. The shift of the U.S. Corn Belt and extension of North American wheat areas have been observed in past decades, indicating the significant long-term impact of climate change on agricultural land use. To understand cropping pattern changes and estimate the potential socio-economic impact, monitoring changes of cropland use at a high spatiotemporal scale are greatly needed.\n\nExtracting general features from historical data and generating near-real-time crop maps are of great significance for estimating the impact of climate change on crop yield and early warning of extreme weather events.
