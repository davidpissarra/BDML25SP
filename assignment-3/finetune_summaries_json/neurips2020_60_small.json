We build a cross-sector dataset containing 22,534 environmental reports from 1999 to 2019, of which 2,187 are ICT speciﬁc. We then apply CatE, a text-embedding-based topic modeling method, to mine speciﬁc keywords that ICT companies use to report on climate change and energy. As a result, we identify (1) im- portant shifts in ICT companies’ climate change narratives from physical metrics towards climate-related disasters, (2) key organizations with large inﬂuence on ICT companies, and (3) ICT companies’ increasing focus on data center and server energy efﬁciency. 1 Introduction The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) industry is a sizable industry that accounts for an estimated global economic worth of $11.5 trillion and 15.5 percent of global GDP [ 1]. The growth of the ICT industry has increased its environmental and social impacts to a level of global concern. In particular, research shows that the ICT industry currently accounts for approximately 3 percent of the global annual carbon footprint. This percentage is expected to grow as the world is increasingly reliant on digital technologies [2]. At an industry level, an increasing but small number of ICT companies have demonstrated understanding of their environmental and social impacts within their supply chains through information disclosure and external veriﬁcation [ 3]. Yet, we still lack a systematic understanding of what has been disclosed. We have limited contextual and empirical understanding of how sustainability practices have developed in the ICT sector and how they have evolved over time. This paper demonstrates our effort to create a text database of companies’ sustainability disclosures over the past two decades from the largest sustainability reporting database. Subsequently we use unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) methods to uncover the shifting themes and narratives from companies in the ICT industry over time. In particular, we focus on companies’ sustainability disclosures relevant to climate change and energy programs. To extract information relevant to these speciﬁc topics, we propose to shift from the standard Latent Dirichlet Allocation [ 4] topic modeling tool and instead apply CatE, a text-embedding based, category-guided topic mining method [ 5], to retrieve representative words and phrases that showcase how companies interpret and establish policies regarding climate change over time. Through our experiments, we found that ICT companies’ sustainability reporting related to climate change has shifted from the initial focus on the heat-trapping gases and pollutants contributing to climate change towards climate-related extremes and disasters intensiﬁed by climate change. Over time, the climate policy narratives have shifted from mitigation and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to adaptation and Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.preparedness for the impacts of climate change. Over time, nonproﬁts and international climate conferences have been increasingly and consistently mentioned by ICT companies. 2 Relevant Works Computational text analysis has been adopted as a beneﬁcial tool in environmental studies only in recent years. Researchers have used it for environmental meta-reviews and organizations’ sustainability disclosures, where it helps create “comprehensive, replaceable, interdisciplinary reviews that provide rapid, up-to-date, and policy-relevant reports of existing work” [6]. Early studies used word frequency analysis to understand the topical focus of companies’ sustainability programs [ 7]. More recently, topic modeling has been applied as a tool in reviewing textual data in climate change related areas of environmental science, including identifying emerging themes in life cycle assessment literature as well as companies’ sustainability reporting [ 8,9]. The most commonly used technique is the Latent Dirichlet Algorithm (LDA) [ 4]. LDA is an unsupervised method that learns topic-word and document-topic distributions by modeling the generative process of the corpus. In prior analyses using text mining, LDA was used to explore main topics in companies’ sustainability reporting between 1995 to 2005 and has revealed a broad picture of companies’ sustainability practices and generic reporting themes in economic, social, and environmental dimensions [9]. However, a constraint of applying LDA is that the topical results are generic and non-discriminative. It does not enhance our understanding of speciﬁc sustainability issues such as climate change. As a result, LDA is not a suitable tool for more speciﬁc discovery-focused questions, such as “How do companies’ sustainability reporting and policy shift around climate change?” In the NLP literature, there is a line of research on this issue, where users can provide a list of seed words to guide the topic discovery process [ 10,11,5]. In particular, we choose to employ the CatE model [ 5], which is a method that learns discriminative category- guided word embeddings and selects category-representative keywords based on embedding similarity and word distributional speciﬁcity. As a result, CatE learns an embedding space that best separates the user-interested set\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
