We treat forecasting as an image-to-image translation problem and leverage the power of the ubiquitous U-Net convolutional neural network. We ﬁnd this performs favor- ably when compared to three commonly used models: optical ﬂow, persistence and NOAA’s numerical one-hour HRRR nowcasting prediction. 1 Introduction High-resolution precipitation nowcasting is the problem of forecasting precipitation in the near-future at high spatial resolutions. This kind of forecasting requires the processing of large amounts of data at low latency, a trait well-suited for machine learning. In contrast, most traditional approaches use either an optical ﬂow (OF) model [ 7] or a numerical model. OF models attempt to identify how objects move through a sequence of images, but are unable to represent the dynamics of storm initiation or decay (which arguably drive most real-world decisions by those using weather forecasts). Numerical methods explicitly simulate the underlying atmospheric physics, and can provide reliable forecasts, but typically take hours to perform inferences, which limits their ability to be used in nowcasting. As weather patterns are altered by climate change, and as the frequency of extreme weather events increases, it becomes more important to provide actionable predictions at high spatial and temporal resolutions. Such predictions facilitate effective planning, crisis management, and the reduction of losses to life and property. A DL-based infrastructure can provide predictions within minutes of receiving new data, allowing them to be fully integrated into a highly responsive prediction service that may better suit the needs of nowcasting than traditional numerical methods. In this paper, we focus on the subproblem of predicting the instantaneous rate of precipitation one hour into the future from Doppler radar. Speciﬁcally, we provide three binary classiﬁcations that indicate whether the rate exceeds thresholds that roughly correspond to trace rain,light rain and moderate rain. Our forecasts are at 1km spatial resolution, are within the continental United States and are based on data from NEXRAD [ 5].

The system combines radar with surface observations and numerical weather prediction methods to get a high resolution map of current conditions. We use MRMS data for the period of July 2017 through July 2019. Individually, each radar station scans its environment in a radial pattern where the scan time and elevation angle is varied to provide a 3D volumetric reﬂectivity map. Spatial resolution is generally within 1km radius\u00021 degree azimuth. There are many gaps in coverage but also overlapping regions covered by multiple stations. We use the MRMS dataset [ 17], which removes non-meteorological artifacts and projects the combined observations onto a rectangular grid. We transform the data in three ways.
