Due to a recent increase in extreme air quality events, both globally and locally in the United States, finer resolution air quality forecasting guidance is needed to effectively adapt to these events. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration provides air quality forecast- ing guidance for the Continental United States. Their air quality forecasting model is based on a 15 km spatial resolution; however, the goal is to reach a three km spatial resolution. This is currently not feasible due in part to prohibitive compu- tational requirements for modeling the transport of chemical species. In this work, we describe a deep learning transport emulator that is able to reduce computations while maintaining skill comparable with the existing numerical model. We show how this method maintains skill in the presence of extreme air quality events, mak- ing it a potential candidate for operational use. We also explore evaluating how well this model maintains the physical properties of the modeled transport for a given set of species. 1 Introduction There has been a significant increase in high pollution air quality (AQ) events. These events are shown to have a strong sensitivity to extreme meteorological events such as heat waves [2]. Increased wildfire activity has specifically contributed to a sudden increase in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) AQ pollution in the United States [3]. Studies show that increased emissions and climate change can Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.negatively impact air quality [9]. Since AQ has a direct correlation with increases in human-related illness and mortality [6, 8], it is important for AQ forecasting to address this changing environment. Operational AQ forecasting guidance is provided by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Ad- ministration (NOAA) for the Continental United States (CONUS). The NOAA forecasting guidance system is computationally challenged by the transport of chemical species which involves solving a set of physical governing equations. This transport is a critical component of modeling AQ and presents a challenge for reaching finer spatial resolutions. In this study, we explore the feasibility of using deep learning as a transport emulator to provide a speed-up in overall computation, potentially enabling finer resolution modeling. We built our method to tolerate bursts of extreme AQ events without a loss in skill. This is an important factor, as extreme AQ events present a challenge for the existing NOAA AQ forecasting system. 1.1 Background NOAA provides operational forecast guidance for AQ, including ozone and PM2.5. NOAA uses the Unified Forecast System Air Quality (UFS-AQ) model for AQ forecasting [19]. The UFS-AQ transport of chemical tracers, which is used to calculate how species advect across the United States, is essential for AQ forecasts. Approximately 40% of the overall computation time is spent in the transport module, where, for each grid point across CONUS, for each of the 64 vertical levels that represent vertical atmospheric conditions, and at each timestep, calculations must be performed. The sheer number of computations contributes to the intractability of reaching a three km resolution. The transport of 183 chemical tracers is used to provide 72-hour forecasts. Each of the chemical species is sequentially passed into the transport module approximately every 30 minutes. After the transport module, each of the species is also processed in two other processing modules, the physics module and the chemistry module (which is applied to all species simultaneously) before the next transport timestep. 1.2 Related Work Early Machine Learning (ML) methods which were used to speed up calculations by emulating pa- rameterizations of atmospheric physics and chemistry include [4, 7, 15]. Work related to chemistry emulation in an effort to replace this component of a model [4] showed early promise of applying shallow neural networks to this class of problems. This work and the early promise of AI methods have been cautiously explored for weather forecasting. Data-driven AI methods have been shown to capture the physics of weather by using deep levels of abstraction across multiple layers of con- volution. Recent research has shown impressive results when using data-driven AI methods for weather forecasting [11, 12, 14, 20] devoid of any explicit knowledge pertaining to the underlying physics. Many of the current state of the art weather forecasting AI models have shown excellent results forecasting a selection of weather variables and modeling a subset of vertical levels closest to the Earthâ€™s surface [5, 10]. While models such as GraphCast [5] apply standard normalization to the residuals of each atmospheric variable, our model is species-agnostic, enabling a more flexible approach.
