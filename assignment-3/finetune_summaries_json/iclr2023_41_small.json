This paper suggests to rethink PV portfolio designs by deriving mean- variability hedged PV portfolios with smartly orientated tilt and azimuth angles. Based on a data-driven method inspired from modern portfolio the- ory, we formulate the problem as a biobjective, non-convex optimization problem which is solved based on automatically differentiating the physical PV conversion model subject to individual tilt and azimuth angles. To il- lustrate the performance of the proposed method, a case study is designed to derive efficient frontiers in the mean-variability spectrum of Germany’s PV portfolio based on representative grid points. The proposed method al- lows decision-makers to hedge between variability and yield in PV portfolio design decisions. This is the first study highlighting the problem of ignor- ing variability in PV portfolio expansion schemes and introduces a way to tackle this issue using modern methods inspired by Machine Learning. 1 Introduction The large-scale deployment of renewable energy is the key pillar to achieve carbon-neutral energy systems and as part of this transition, PV has a crucial role to provide affordable, clean energy with expected increasing expansion rates in the coming years to meet climate targets (IEA, 2022). In the past, countries have decided on a multitude of different incentive schemes to increase the individual’s willingness to invest in PV systems. Feed-in tariffs are the most prominent policy tool in Europe and show a positive track to increase PV shares over the last years (Sun and Nie, 2015; Lipp, 2007). However, remunerating each generated energy unit equally, as achieved by feed-in tariffs, only focuses on maximizing annual PV yield and therefore assumes that annual yield is the single important metric. This leads, however, to similar PV system orientations at regions with large solar irradiance potential and therefore to clusters of highly correlated PV systems. Meteorological events relevant for solar irradiance, such as clouds and fog, then more likely affect the same clustered region of PV systems which leads to large PV feed-in variability. These events often can not be reliably forecasted which results into a large mismatch between planned and available solar energy in these clustered regions. Energy systems need to balance this mismatch through costly ancillary services within the electrical grid. Whereas there is a large body of literature describing solar energy variability of existing PV farms (Hoff and Perez, 2012; Perez et al., 2012; Ranalli and Peerlings, 2021; Lave and Kleissl, 2013; Lave et al., 2013; 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 Wid´ en, 2015; Elsinga, 2017), there is to the best of the authors knowledge no literature yet about how variability can be integrated into the investors decision to hedge between yield and variability. We argue that the design of decentralized, smart PV portfolios have the potential to reduce the portfolio variability maintaining large levels of yield. We therefore formulate the PV portfolio decision as a non-convex PV portfolio optimization problem inspired from the well- known mean-variance portfolio optimization problem. Based on the advances in Machine Learning to design efficient batch-wise optimization algorithms for non-convex optimization problems, we formulate the optimization problem including the non-convex PV conversion process in a data-driven fashion and automatically differentiate based on the azimuth and tilt angles which are the most important controllable parameters of the PV conversion process (Saint-Drenan, 2015). In a case study covering Germany, we show that the proposed method can derive well-balanced PV portfolios in terms of risk and reward. This paper aims to create awareness for smarter PV portfolios in the mean-variability spectrum to create system- friendlier solar energy feed-ins by introducing an easy-to-use method based on automatic differentiation which can be relevant for academia and policy designers. 2 Mean-variability optimization of PV capacity factors 2.1 PV portfolio simulation To simulate PV systems, a physical model is required which describes the energy conversion from incoming solar irradiance to actual usable PV feed-ins.
