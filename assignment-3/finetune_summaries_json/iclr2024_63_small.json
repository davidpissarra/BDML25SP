In tackling these questions, we show stable prediction of surface fields for over 8 years, training and testing on data from a high-resolution coupled climate model, using results from four regions of the globe. Our work lays out a set of physically motivated guidelines for building ocean climate emulators. 1 I NTRODUCTION In the last few years, we have seen substantial growth in the development of machine-learning (ML) methods applied to weather and climate problems. In particular, many have successfully built data- driven emulators to provide low-cost representations for the complex dynamics of the climate system (Beucler et al., 2023). Several emulators have been shown to perform as well or better than state-of- the-art numerical weather models on short-time scales (Bi et al., 2023; Kochkov et al., 2023; Pathak et al., 2022). Beyond weather, the related problem of long-term atmosphere emulation, that is, time scales span- ning ten to hundreds of years, has emerged in the literature (Kochkov et al., 2023; Bonev et al., 2023; Watt-Meyer et al., 2023). Recently, three applications of ocean emulation have shown some success: an idealized model for multi-decadal timescales (Bire et al., 2023), a regional emulation on subsea- sonal timescales (Chattopadhyay et al., 2023), and a 3D global emulation on 30-day timescales (Xiong et al., 2023). The emulation of ocean dynamics involves a different set of challenges to that of the atmosphere. As we continue to confront the growing risks of a changing climate, the need to develop reliable models to simulate the global climate will prove essential for adaptation and mitigation. In this work, we highlight key considerations for building emulators of regional (and global) ocean climate models by assessing the role of boundary conditions and designing a framework for multi- scale emulation (e.g., different spatio-temporal scales). Understanding the appropriate boundary inputs and scales on which to model velocity and temperature is critical for successfully emulating complex multi-scale ocean physics. Using a simple network design, a U-Net (Ronneberger et al., 2015), we can run a large array of experiments that explore the sensitivities of the model to different inputs and time steps. Our results, which focus on emulating surface ocean fields, in which multi- scale physics is a determining factor, should help guide future implementations of more costly, state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. ∗Correspondence: adam.subel@nyu.edu 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 2 M ETHODS 2.1 D ATA We use data from the last 20 years of a pre-industrial control simulation of the GFDL CM2.6 coupled climate model, with a nominal ocean resolution of 1/10◦(Delworth et al., 2012). We focus on emulating four regions (the Gulf Stream, the Tropics, the South Pacific, and the African Cape, see fig. 4), which provide a range of dynamics for evaluating the emulators. The data are regridded from the native ocean resolution of 1/10◦onto a grid with a resolution of 1/4◦(equivalent to a coarser version of the same climate model, CM2.5). To remove mesoscale turbulence, a source of short-term, local variability, the data is further filtered at a fixed factor corresponding to 1◦(Loose et al., 2022). For the atmospheric data, which is natively on a 1/2◦-resolution grid, we use bilinear interpolation of the data directly onto the 1/4◦-resolution grid. We will consider the state vector predicted by the network to be Φ= (u, v, T ), which represents the zonal velocity, meridional velocity, and temperature, respectively, in the surface layer. We let τ= (τu, τv, Tatm)represent the state vector for the surface atmosphere boundary conditions, which are zonal wind stress, meridional wind stress, and air temperature respectively. We include details on the training and testing splits in the appendix. 2.2 I NPUT FEATURES Our network is a U-Net with four upsampling and downsampling layers, yielding O(107)param- eters.

Introduction\n\nIn recent years, there has been significant growth in the application of machine-learning (ML) methods to weather and climate problems. Many researchers have successfully developed data-driven emulators to provide low-cost representations of the complex dynamics of the climate system. These emulators have been shown to perform as well as or better than state-of-the-art numerical weather models on short-time scales. However, the related problem of long-term atmosphere emulation, spanning ten to hundreds of years, has also emerged in the literature.\n\nRecent studies have shown some success in ocean emulation, including an idealized model for multi-decadal timescales, a regional emulation on subseasonal timescales, and a 3D global emulation on 30-day timescales. Emulating ocean dynamics poses different challenges than emulating the atmosphere. As the risks of a changing climate continue to grow, developing reliable models to simulate the global climate will be essential for adaptation and mitigation.\n\nThis work highlights key considerations for building emulators of regional and global ocean climate models by assessing the role of boundary conditions and designing a framework for multi-scale emulation. Understanding the appropriate boundary inputs and scales for modeling velocity and temperature is critical for successfully emulating complex multi-scale ocean physics.\n\n2.
