Recent efforts have lever- aged deep neural networks from computer vision to enhance the spatial resolution of meteorological data, showing promise for statistical downscaling. However, methodological diversity and insufficient comparisons with traditional downscal- ing techniques challenge these advancements. Our study introduces a bench- mark dataset for statistical downscaling, utilizing ERA5 and the finer-resolution COSMO-REA6, to facilitate direct comparisons of downscaling methods for 2m temperature, global (solar) irradiance and 100m wind fields. Accompanying U- Net, GAN, and transformer models with a suite of evaluation metrics aim to stan- dardize assessments and promote transparency and confidence in applying deep learning to meteorological downscaling. 1 I NTRODUCTION Addressing climate change effectively requires accurate observation and modeling of weather and climate, including high-resolution data that is crucial for both understanding global climate patterns and supporting the transition towards renewable energy. The goal of achieving a fossil fuel-free sta- tus by 2040 emphasizes the urgency of shifting to renewable sources such as wind and photovoltaic (PV) production. This transition is not only a response to the imperative of climate change mitiga- tion but also a strategic move to ensure energy security and sustainability. As such, localized and regional forecasts play a pivotal role in guiding adaptation strategies, influencing decisions across various sectors including agriculture, energy, and transportation, and specifically in planning the construction of new wind and PV power plant sites. Here, downscaling in climate science, simi- lar to super-resolution in computer vision, offers an efficient method to infer local, high-resolution quantities from the coarser scale variables. This technique is of utmost importance for assessing re- newable energy resources, like wind speed at a currently prominent hub height of 100 m and global solar radiation, and their possible changes with climate change. There exists a rapidly growing number of deep learning (DL) approaches tackling downscaling of a variety of meteorological variables, across different scales and regions. Following the state-of- the-art in super-resolution, there are impressive results from methods like CNNs [33], GANs [30], diffusion-based models [21], or foundation models [23] in downscaling. Intercomparison though is hard, given that the metrics, baselines, and datasets used vary almost among all approaches. 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Target domain for downscaling depicted in black in the COSMO-REA6 projection. Benchmark datasets like WeatherBench [26] or ClimateBench [35] have helped to improve and unify fields like DL for weather forecasts or climate projections. The field of deep learning for downscaling though is still lacking a dataset and framework to compare and benchmark promising architectures. A downscaling benchmark dataset will aid both research and deployment. It pro- vides an useful and carefully designed test setup for ML researchers and developers aiming to craft novel neural network architectures. This will give an insight of the most promising models to the researchers working on real-world applications of downscaling.

With the ambition to provide a benchmark dataset that is usable and practical for the sci- entific community, we closely follow the recipe to build proper benchmark datasets for Atmospheric Sciences as provided by [7]. 2.1 D OWNSCALING TASKS AND DATA The benchmark dataset comprises three downscaling tasks for the generation of high-resolved data fields of 2m temperature, 100m-wind, and global horizontal irradiance generated from a coarse- grained set of predictor variables. Reanalysis datasets are well suited for this purpose since they provide a comprehensive, consistent, and quality-controlled database. The global ERA5 reanalysis dataset [14], is chosen as the coarse- grained input for our downscaling task. Its spatio-temporal coverage (global, 1940 to near present), however, restricts its spatial resolution to a 0.25°-grid and thus barely represents the spatial variabil- ity over complex terrain. The regional COSMO-REA6 reanalysis dataset [3], in contrast, can depict the spatial variability in meteorological fields in more detail.
