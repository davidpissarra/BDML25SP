    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters removed and the content preserved:\n\n\"Severity of wildfires in many areas necessitates an urgent need to accurately statistically model wildfire risks. Wildfire risk modeling requires accounting for several separate but related risk components, which can be viewed as a \"wildfire risk pipeline.\" First, one must model where fires are most likely to start, based on weather, human activity, and related factors. Then, based on a fire's location, model the fire's duration and size. Finally, a model can project risk exposure, the number of lives or properties exposed to the fire.\n\nPrior work has generally modeled each component in isolation and typically limited to small regions, due to the varied spatiotemporal resolution and quality of open data available for modeling on a national scale. Both physical and stochastic models have been used to model the various wildfire risk components. Fire locations have typically been modeled as point process models, fit by maximum likelihood over discretized space-time grids. Logistic Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) have been used to model seasonal non-linear relationships among fire occurrence and covariates. Fire duration is usually modeled via survival analysis techniques; as duration is typically heavy-tailed, the baseline survivor functions are modeled as Gaussian, Gumbel, or logistic distributions. Parametric heavy-tailed distributions are often used for fire size as well (e.g., tapered Pareto, Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, and generalized Pareto distribution with additional environmental features as inputs).\n\nPrevious work has generally sought to model each component of wildfire risk separately. More specifically, fire occurrence was combined with an independent survival model, and bivariate extreme value models were used in marked point process settings to explicitly model dependence between wildfire risk components. Our contribution in this paper is threefold. First, we seek to provide end-to-end modeling of the wildfire risk pipeline with an emphasis on both predictive accuracy and uncertainty for each risk estimate in the pipeline. Our proposed model accounts for fire location, size, duration, and risk exposure sequentially, so that uncertainty in each step can be propagated to later steps. Second, we seek to build our models using the entire continental United States using open data, rather than limiting our analysis to a specific state or county. Third, we provide open-source code to download, transform, and aggregate open data relevant to wildfire prediction in the continental United States. We hope this will set an openly available national benchmark for wildfire risk modeling.\n\nOur data aggregation pipeline aims to provide open-source code to extract, transform, and load (ETL) publicly available wildfire-related data in the continental United States to produce a single database containing all information relevant to wildfires. The first release includes the following data sources: (i) wildfire perimeters from both the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity project (MTBS, 1984-2016) and Geospatial Multi-Agency Coordination (GeoMAC, 2000-2019); (ii) weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), specifically the daily global historical climatology network and storm events database; (iii) wildfire data from the US Forest Service archive (up to 2015); and (iv) lightning strikes from the National Lightning Detection Network (NDLN, 1986-2018). Our code conveniently consolidates all these disparate data sources into a single open geospatial SQL database.\n\nWe propose to model wildfire occurrence as a spatiotemporal point process. Each observed wildfire is an event comprising the fire's 2D spatial location and the time the fire occurred. Each fire also has additional features, known as marks: the fire's duration, size, and the exposure risk of the fire (e.g., lives at risk). The point process model has several parts. The ground process models the underlying spatial and temporal patterns of wildfire occurrence, while the mark process models the additional features of each wildfire.\""
