    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). A complete elaboration of the topics covered in this summary can be found in this Synthesis Report and in the underlying reports of the three Working Groups.\n\n1. Observed changes in climate and their effects\n\nWarming of the climate system is unequivocal, as evident from observations of increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average sea level (Figure SPM.1). Eleven of the last twelve years (1995-2006) rank among the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record of global surface temperature (since 1850). The 100-year linear trend (1906-2005) of 0.74°C (0.56 to 0.92) is larger than the corresponding trend of 0.6°C (0.4 to 0.8) (1901-2000) given in the Third Assessment Report (TAR) (Figure SPM.1). The temperature increase is widespread over the globe and is greater at higher northern latitudes. Land regions have warmed faster than the oceans (Figures SPM.2, SPM.4).\n\nRising sea level is consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Global average sea level has risen since 1961 at an average rate of 1.8 mm/yr (1.3 to 2.3) and since 1993 at 3.1 mm/yr (2.4 to 3.8), with contributions from thermal expansion, melting glaciers and ice caps, and the polar ice sheets. Whether the faster rate for 1993 to 2003 reflects decadal variation or an increase in the longer-term trend is unclear.\n\nObserved decreases in snow and ice extent are also consistent with warming (Figure SPM.1). Satellite data since 1978 show that annual average Arctic sea ice extent has shrunk by 2.7% (2.1 to 3.3) per decade, with larger decreases in summer of 7.4% (5.0 to 9.8) per decade. Mountain glaciers and snow cover on average have declined in both hemispheres.\n\nFrom 1900 to 2005, precipitation increased significantly in eastern parts of North and South America, northern Europe, and northern and central Asia but declined in the Sahel, the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of southern Asia. Globally, the area affected by drought has likely increased since the 1970s.\n\nIt is very likely that over the past 50 years:\n\n- Cold days, cold nights, and frosts have become less frequent over most land areas.\n- Hot days and hot nights have become more frequent.\n- Heat waves have become more frequent over most land areas.\n- The frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most areas.\n- Since 1975, the incidence of extreme high sea level has increased worldwide.\n\nThere is observational evidence of an increase in intense tropical cyclone activity in the North Atlantic since about 1970, with limited evidence of increases elsewhere. There is no clear trend in the annual numbers of tropical cyclones.
