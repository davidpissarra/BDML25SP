Rapid intensiﬁcation (RI) is the signiﬁcant strengthening in storm wind speed within a short time (e.g. >30 kt over 24 hours), and almost all historical category 4 and 5 hurricanes are RI storms ( 7). To mitigate the potential high damage and risks, predicting rapid intensiﬁcation has been identiﬁed as one of the highest operational forecasting priorities in the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Even though, RI prediction is still challenging as it involves multi-scale physical interactions where both environmental and internal convective processes contribute to the RI occurrence (13; 14; 4). Despite the low predictability, progress has been made in RI prediction. Existing studies can be categorized into three kinds: 1) Dynamical models : Dynamical models make prediction by solving primitive equations, however only high-resolution models show skill in NHC ( 2;3). While the advantages of higher spatial resolution are consensus when resolving micro-physical processes within the TC, the simulations require accurate initialization and considerable computing power and time for completion; 2) Statistical models : Statistical models do not resolve TC inner core, but perform TC intensity forecasting using regression equations with large-scale environmental parameters ( 9;8;15). Statistical models show skill in providing RI probabilistic guidance, however are constraint by their inherent linearity, considering the highly nonlinear meteorological relationships in TC. 3) Machine learning models : Recently, machine learning models have been proposed for RI prediction, including naïve Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest ( 16), and deep learning ( 11). These models have better capacity and can effectively mine signals from the data. However, both statistical models and machine learning models reply on hand-craft features extracted manually from raw climate data. 2 End-to-end Deep Learning for RI To the best of our knowledge, there is not yet a deep learning model that takes raw climate data and directly make prediction for RI.Such an end-to-end model allows joint optimization over both the feature extraction and the classiﬁcation model to pursue better global optima. The major advantage of our method compared to others is to automatically learn discriminative features from raw climate data rather than heuristic hand-crafted features (Fig. 1). Data Preparation we use data from multiple resources including visible and infrared satellite imagery provided by operational geostationary satellites and passive microwave imagery from polar- orbiting satellites, aiming to capture TC inner-core structure and cloud features. To augment the 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.Figure 1: End-to-end Rapid Intensiﬁcation Prediction. We propose to directly predict RI from raw climate data without intermediate heuristic hand-craft features. training data scale which is important for deep learning, we also use synthetic data from climate model projections, such as HiFLOR, which is able to simulate Category 4 and 5 TCs (12). We do not extract any features or indices that were heuristically designed to measure hurricane characteristics. Instead, we directly crop 2D patches, e.g. 16\u000216in longitude/latitude degree, which corresponds to approximately 1800\u00021800 in kilometers that are sufﬁcient to cover all surroundings of a single TC. We then concatenate various 2D raw climate data in the channel dimension, which gives us a 2D feature map in dimension of 16\u000216\u0002N, where Nis the number of raw observation. We train separate models for RI prediction for different lead-time, i.e. 6h, 12h, 18h, 24h, and create corresponding training data sets respectively. For each lead-time, we split independent TCs into training and test split to prevent potential correlations. Overall, this gives us by estimation roughly 4000 TCs in training set, and each TC provides a series of pairs of feature map and ground truth binary label indicating whether RI happens. Model Architecture Given the nature of our model, which takes 2D feature maps as input and pro- duces a probability or hard decision for RI, there are many convolutional neural network architectures we could refer to. In terms of the capacity from low to high, AlexNet ( 10), VGG ( 5), and ResNet ( 5) are all good options. Imbalance Data The deep learning model may suffer from data imbalance, since RI rate is pretty low. As a result, the training data contains much less positive data (i.e. RI happens) compared to the negative ones, and a naive random shufﬂe would likely to lead the network bias toward the negative. Speciﬁcally for RI, we propose to use the following methodology to deal with imbalanced data. 1.Hard negative mining.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nLarge forecast errors are often due to the challenge of predicting the rapid intensification of tropical cyclones. Rapid intensification (RI) is a significant strengthening of storm wind speed within a short time frame (e.g., more than 30 knots over 24 hours). Almost all historical category 4 and 5 hurricanes are RI storms. To mitigate potential high damage and risks, predicting rapid intensification has been identified as a top priority for the National Hurricane Center (NHC). Despite the low predictability, progress has been made in RI prediction.\n\nExisting studies can be categorized into three types: \n\n1. Dynamical models: These models make predictions by solving primitive equations, but only high-resolution models show skill in the NHC. While high spatial resolution is beneficial for resolving microphysical processes within the TC, the simulations require accurate initialization and significant computing power and time for completion.\n\n2. Statistical models: These models do not resolve the TC's inner core but perform TC intensity forecasting using regression equations with large-scale environmental parameters. Statistical models show skill in providing RI probabilistic guidance, but are limited by their inherent linearity, considering the highly nonlinear meteorological relationships in TC.\n\n3. Machine learning models: Recently, machine learning models have been proposed for RI prediction, including naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machines, random forest, and deep learning. These models have better capacity and can effectively mine signals from the data.

We then concatenate various 2D raw climate data in the channel dimension, resulting in a 2D feature map in the dimension of 16x16xN, where N is the number of raw observations. We train separate models for RI prediction for different lead times, i.e., 6h, 12h, 18h, and 24h, and create corresponding training data sets.
