We show that the proposed data augmentation strategy helps enhance the performance of the state-of-the-art convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) model by a reasonable amount, resulting in a noteworthy improvement in spatial correlation and a reduction in prediction error. 1 Introduction Long-term exposure to fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 µmor smaller (PM 2.5) is is extensively recognized for increasing the risk of a variety of health problems such as stroke [ 1,2], respiratory diseases [ 3], and ischemic heart disease [ 1,4]. Accurate estimation and prediction of ground-level PM 2.5concentrations are critical initial steps for subsequent epidemi- ological investigations into its health impacts. In recent years, advancements in satellite sensing techniques have enabled researchers to construct a high-resolution spatial mapping of PM 2.5using machine learning models, in conjunction with ground measurements (e.g. PM 2.5, PM 10, temperature, humidity, etc.) acquired from air quality monitoring (AQM) stations [5–7]. However, in most cases, the satellite-based data is much more abundant compared to ground measurements, resulting in a large amount of unlabeled satellite data (i.e., satellite images at locations without a paired ground measurement). To elaborate, satellites have the capacity to cover entire urban areas and a majority of suburban regions of a city within a 24-hour window. In contrast, measurements from ground stations are only representative within their immediate vicinity, which we refer to as the “area of interest\" (AOI). In most cases, the combined AOI of all ground stations is sparse compared to area covered by the satellite. To address the aforementioned limitation, we come up with an approach to make full use of the unlabeled satellite data and effectively integrate them with ground measurements. Specifically, we propose to pair the unlabeled satellite data with pseudo-labels of ground measurements generated by a spatial interpolation method known as ordinary kriging and then augment the labeled dataset using these paired instances. In this study, we adopt the convolutional neural network-random forest (CNN-RF) model from Zheng et al. [6]. Our experimental results demonstrate the substantial advantages gained from this kriging-based augmentation, including decent reduction in errors and improvement in spatial correlation. ∗Equal contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Illustration of pseudo-label generation process. The ground measurements consist of the ground-level PM 2.5along with 3 meteorological attributes: sea level pressure (SLP), temperature (T), and relative humidity (RH). We first create a spatial mapping of interpolated measurements for the entire area of study using ordinary kriging. Then we pair unlabeled satellite images with corresponding interpolated measurements based on their geographical coordinates. Namely, each final data point with pseudo labels consists of 5 components: satellite image, interpolated SLP, T, RH, and PM 2.5measurements. 2 Related work Kriging The theoretical basis of kriging, alternatively known as Gaussian process (GP) regression, was developed by Georges Matheron [ 8]. Within geostatistics models, kriging serves as a spatial interpolation method where each data point is treated as a sample from a stochastic process [ 9–11]. It also includes several distinct variants (e.g., ordinary kriging [ 12,13], universal kriging [ 14], co- kriging [ 14,15], etc.) that are categorized based on the properties of the stochastic process. There are previous research efforts where kriging is applied to the context of remote sensing and climate modeling. To elaborate, Zhan et al. [16] developed a random forest-spatiotemporal kriging model to estimate the daily NO 2concentrations in China from satellite data and geographical covariates. Wu and Li [17] employed residual kriging to interpolate average monthly temperature using latitude, longitude, and elevation as input variables. Besides these, researchers also used GPs for interpolation along with other sequence models [18] or classification models [19] in machine learning. Fusing Satellite and Ground Data The large gap in data density between satellite observations and ground measurements is a common phenomenon in the fields of remote sensing and climate modeling, leading researchers to develop a variety of approaches to address this issue. For instance, Jiang et al. [20] introduced the spatiotemporal contrastive learning strategy, which involves pre-training deep learning models using unlabeled satellite images to improve the model performance on ground measurements. Verdin et al. [21] employed Bayesian kriging to model the ground observations of rainfall, with the mean parameterized as a linear function of satellite estimates and elevation.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
