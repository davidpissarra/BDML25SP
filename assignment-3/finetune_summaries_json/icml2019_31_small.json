Introduction Ubiquitous sensing technologies (Paradiso, 2016) can be used to capture aspects of ecosystem function and ecological transformation with minimal impact at high resolution over long periods of time.

In the ecological research community, wildlife surveys are still conducted by experts estimating a given species population at a speciﬁc time. Intensive manual efforts are required, even with the help of recordings and modern signal processing tools. Field surveyors need to maintain perceptual awareness and attention to detail. Efforts to automate surveys are vital to gaining a real-time understanding of a massive wave of species extinction. This represents a signiﬁcant opportunity for Artiﬁcial Intelli- gence (AI) systems, which thrive on big data, and might one day be able to analyze and characterize wildlife popu- lations around the globe.

For example, the biophony is intrinsically complex in terms of vocalizations (e.g. birds) and diverse regard- ing species candidates. However, the biophony is mainly produced by non-visible creatures. A multi-modal sensing approach can help separate noisy geophony and anthrophony from the desired wildlife signal. One crucial requirement is a system’s ability to detect new species in an area, especially in a dynamic restoration program such as the one presented in Section 2. Regions of interest for wildlife sensing are often difﬁcult to access and lack physical infrastructure. Such environments are generally hostile to technology. For example, there may be large gradients of temperature and humidity. Also, outdoor deployments are subject to unpredictable events like lighting strikes, ant colony intrusion, and rodent mastication of system wiring. In a well-designed real-world deployment, the AI infrastructure can be turned inwards to ﬂag system failures, e.g. water intrusion, blurry images, lost signal, etc. Some recent contributions have demonstrated the ability of Deep Learning to scale biologists’ efforts to identify wildlife. For example, automatic animal identiﬁcation from camera trap images using a VGG model trained on 1.4 million images over 48 classes was shown to have 96.8% accuracy (Norouzzadeh et al., 2018). AI can be leveraged to save time when used with human volunteers. For acoustic identiﬁcation of wildlife, several new contri- butions focus on deep learning technology, such as (Strout et al., 2017) for amphibians, (Mac Aodha et al., 2018) for bats, (Kiskin et al., 2017) for insects, and (Potamitis, 2016) for bird vocalization segmentation.
