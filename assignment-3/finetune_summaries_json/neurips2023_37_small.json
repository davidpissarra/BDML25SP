However, the physical processes underlying these changes are not well understood, in part due to the difficulty of characterizing and tracking changes in ocean physics in complex models. Using the Antarctic Circumpolar Current as a case study, we extend the method Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) to a mesoscale eddy permitting climate model and identify regions of the ocean characterized by similar physics, called dynamical regimes, using readily accessible fields from climate models. To this end, we cluster grid cells into dynamical regimes and train an ensemble of neural networks, allowing uncertainty quantification, to predict these regimes and track them under climate change. Finally, we leverage this new knowledge to elucidate the dynamical drivers of the identified regime shifts as noted by the neural network using the ‘explainability’ methods SHAP and Layer-wise Relevance Propagation. A region undergoing a profound shift is where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current intersects the Pacific- Antarctic Ridge, an area important for carbon draw-down and fisheries. In this region, THOR specifically reveals a shift in dynamical regime under climate change driven by changes in wind stress and interactions with bathymetry. Using this knowledge to guide further exploration, we find that as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current shifts north under intensifying wind stress, the dominant dynamical role of bathymetry weakens and the flow intensifies. 1 Introduction Complex ocean systems such as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) play a central role in the climate through mechanisms such as heat transport via powerful currents, large-scale overturning, and carbon exchange with the atmosphere [ 1–3]. Such systems are known to exhibit a wide array of responses to anthropogenic forcing, but such changes and their underlying physics are poorly constrained [ 3–5]. This is, in part, a direct consequence of difficulties in both characterizing ocean physics and tracking its shifts under climate change. Model intercomparison projects, such as Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) [ 6–8], have set up a vital framework for understanding differences between climate models in both of these areas. A key target for the sixth and current phase of CMIP was to increase the horizontal resolution, which in the ocean partially allows for mesoscale turbulence to be expressed. However, modern models have only exacerbated challenges in characterizing and tracking ocean physics due to their complexity and size. As a result, key systems such as the ACC as well as their variability among models are often described using bulk metrics, such as, the overturning strength integrated over global longitude [ 1,9]. Bulk metrics have limited scope for elucidating the dynamics driving the changes, as these largely vary in space. For the first time, we apply the method Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) proposed by [10] to the ocean of a mesoscale turbulence-permitting model, the Coupled Model 4 [ 11,12], to both understand and track ocean dynamics under climate change. THOR is a three-step process beginning with unsupervised classification of ocean grid cells into dynamical regimes based on their physics. For this step, we use Native Emergent Manifold Interrogation (NEMI) [ 13]. The second component of THOR trains a deep ensemble of neural networks to predict these dynamical regimes from the previous step using readily accessible fields as inputs (e.g., sea surface height, depth, wind stress, and mass transport). Finally, the third step of THOR applies this trained deep ensemble to a new climate change scenario or entirely new model of interest to understand changes in dynamical regimes over time. This step also incorporates uncertainty quantification and eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods to guide further exploration of newly discovered ocean phenomena. Here we use THOR to investigate changes in the the region where the ACC meets the Pacific-Antarctic Ridge (PAR). THOR specifically reveals a shift in dynamical regime in this region under climate change, and XAI methods additionally show that these are related to changes in wind stress and interactions with the bathymetry. Using this new information provided by THOR, we further explore the ACC under climate change and find that the shifts in regional dynamical regime is explained by northward movement of the ACC driven by changes in wind stress. This ACC movement brings it into a new, less variable bathymetric region where its interactions with the sea floor are less strong, thus leading to a flow distributed over a larger area and concentrated at the surface. The remainder of this manuscript is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a more detailed overview of the THOR method. Section 3 details our exploration of the ACC guided by new knowledge revealed by THOR. Lastly, Section 4 concludes the paper with potential directions for future work. 2 Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) Figure 1: Six\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
