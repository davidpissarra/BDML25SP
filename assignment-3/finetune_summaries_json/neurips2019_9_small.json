Experiments show that our model learns feature representations that correspond to expert judgements. In making a contribution to the reliability of wind energy, we hope to encourage organisations to switch to sustainable energy sources and help combat climate change. 1 Introduction Machine learning can play an integral role in tackling climate change by ensuring greater reliability of variable energy, such as wind energy (Rolnick et al., 2019). There is a growing uptake of machine learning in the wind industry to predict operational anomalies (Zaher et al., 2009; Abdallah et al., 2018). The average wind turbine, for example, suffers from a downtime of 1.6 hours every 1.5 days (Peters et al., 2012), leading to losses of up to 1,600 USD per day (Milborrow, 2018). There is currently a paucity of intelligent decision support systems which cannot only predict the occurrence of an impending fault but also generate a human-intelligible diagnosis of its cause(s). Data-to-text generation has been explored for domains such as weather forecast generation (Sripada et al., 2004; Dethlefs and Turner, 2017; Gkatzia et al., 2017), spatial navigation (MacMahon et al., 2006), sports commentaries (Chen et al., 2010; Mei et al., 2016), amongst others. In this paper, we aim to establish the feasibility of applying deep learning and natural language generation to the wind domain in order to generate informative event descriptions of alarms using SCADA data and historical logs of alarm messages. We hope that our initial study can pave the way towards AI-based intelligent decision support systems for operations and maintenance for wind turbines, making them a more reliable energy source and contributing to the uptake and sustainability of wind energy on the whole. 2 Data Description and Preprocessing As input features, we used SCADA data from an operational turbine,1rated at 7MW, including 102 features from the turbine logs on electrical, temperature and pressure readings, operational sensors as well as meteorological data. As outputs, we use human-authored event descriptions for 26 discrete alarm types. See Table 1 for an example of a data structure and error description, where features 1Platform for Operational Data (POD) Disseminated by ORE Catapult: https://pod.ore.catapult.org.uk 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.1-nare sensor readings. A challenge with the original dataset is a substantial class imbalance across alarm types. For instance, the Pitch System Fatal Error event accounted for 5,050 cases owing to the fairly common pitch angle disorientation in turbines, while HPU 2 Pump Active For Too Long only accounted for 2,525 cases. To avoid a biased generation policy that favours majority classes, we use Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) Chawla et al. (2002) to address class imbalance by generating more samples of a certain type while preserving the original data distribution. Ultimately, we obtained 500 examples for each alarm type in an overall dataset of 13,000 samples. Time Stamp Feature 1 ( X0)Feature 2 ( X1)......

We opt for a transformer architecture for this task in the light of recent results that have shown that a transformerâ€™s multi-head attention principle to compute attention weights over sequences in a single iteration can make the model both substantially faster on long sequences as well more accurate in some cases as outputs do not depend on the sequential order of input processing (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019). For our experiments, we use a Transformer with 8 multi-head attention heads, model size of 64, and 3 dense layers for each head. We use two baselines: (1) Seq2Seq is an encoder-decoder model with an LSTM, 200-dimensional word embeddings, 64 hidden neurons, a learning rate of 0:001, dropout of 0.1, and Adam optimisation; and (2) Seq2Seq (Att) in a Seq2Seq model with LSTM and Luong attention Luong et al. (2015) using the same hyperparameters as above. For attention, we use the concat score\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Our work aims to contribute to the reliability of wind energy and encourage the adoption of sustainable energy sources to combat climate change.\n\nMachine learning can play a crucial role in addressing climate change by ensuring the reliability of variable energy sources, such as wind energy (Rolnick et al., 2019). The wind industry has seen a growing adoption of machine learning to predict operational anomalies (Zaher et al., 2009; Abdallah et al., 2018). On average, a wind turbine experiences downtime of 1.6 hours every 1.5 days (Peters et al., 2012), resulting in losses of up to $1,600 per day (Milborrow, 2018). Currently, there is a lack of intelligent decision support systems that can predict the occurrence of impending faults and generate human-intelligible diagnoses of their causes.\n\nData-to-text generation has been explored in various domains, including weather forecast generation (Sripada et al., 2004; Dethlefs and Turner, 2017; Gkatzia et al., 2017), spatial navigation (MacMahon et al., 2006), and sports commentaries (Chen et al., 2010; Mei et al., 2016). In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of applying deep learning and natural language generation to the wind domain to generate informative event descriptions of alarms using SCADA data and historical logs of alarm messages. Our goal is to pave the way for AI-based intelligent decision support systems for operations and maintenance of wind turbines, making them a more reliable energy source and contributing to the adoption and sustainability of wind energy.\n\nWe used SCADA data from an operational 7MW turbine, including 102 features from the turbine logs on electrical, temperature, and pressure readings, operational sensors, and meteorological data. The outputs are human-authored event descriptions for 26 discrete alarm types. The original dataset has a substantial class imbalance across alarm types, with some events occurring much more frequently than others. To address this issue, we used the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) (Chawla et al., 2002) to generate more samples of underrepresented classes while preserving the original data distribution. We obtained 500 examples for each alarm type in a dataset of 13,000 samples.\n\nOur NLG system is modeled as an encoder-decoder architecture that takes a sequence of SCADA features as input and outputs an alarm event description in natural language. We employed a transformer architecture due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently and accurately (Vaswani et al., 2017; Devlin et al., 2019). For our experiments, we used a transformer with 8 multi-head attention heads, a model size of 64, and 3 dense layers for each head. We compared our model with two baselines: a Seq2Seq model with an LSTM and a Seq2Seq model with LSTM and Luong attention (Luong et al., 2015)."
