We present three use-cases along the value chain where machine learning techniques are investigated for quality inspection and process optimization: Adversarial learning to denoise wafer images, align- ment of surface structuring processes via sub-pixel coordinate regression, and the development of a digital twin for wafers and solar cells for material and process analysis. 1 Introduction The transition to a renewable energy supply is a main driver to reduce carbon emission and slow down climate change. Photovoltaic (PV) is a key technology that already contributes to the mix of energy sources for a carbon-free energy production of the future. In order to win the competition against conventional energy sources, the costs of solar cell production must be further reduced to achieve grid parity even in countries with less favorable weather conditions. Following the PV technology roadmap, novel production processes and characterisation methods are implemented to reduce costs and increase throughput and energy conversion efﬁciency. Smaller structures, higher measurements speeds and smarter processes challenge solar energy researchers. We introduce three use-cases along the PV value where novel machine learning techniques offer solutions and opportunities for equipment and solar cell manufacturers as shown in Figure 1. In all applications, we address real world problems and work with data which are experimentally created within our research pilot line. During wafering the silicon ingot is sliced into thin wafers. The diamond wire sawing process was established as a cost efﬁcient alternative to existing processes. Yet, implemented quality inspection methods fail to characterize the samples due to strong surface artifacts visible in the measurements.

(2009)) process has been developed to replace slurry- based wafering. It has established as a standard process in industry due to its higher throughput, cost efﬁciency, environment-friendliness and smaller kerf loss. Although DWS is a novel wafering technology, it comes at the cost of surface damage to the silicon wafers. Current optical inspection tools are optimized to slurry-cut wafers which do not have strong macroscopic saw damage. The implemented algorithms fail to analyze images of DWS wafers due to the strong surface damage. In our ﬁrst use case, machine learning techniques are investigated to remove artifacts from the noisy images. Adversarial networks for denoising. Most machine learning techniques are based on supervised learning. In our case, paired data is not available since a wafer is either slurry-cut or diamond-cut. How can we train a network to remove the noise structures? A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) (Goodfellow et al. (2014)) consists of a generator network and a discriminator network to give feedback about the quality of the result during training. In this work, an adversarial network called ResidualGAN, shown in Figure 2, is implemented for denoising the DWS wafer images.
