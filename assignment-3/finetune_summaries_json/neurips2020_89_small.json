The main contributions of the platform are i) ingesting and processing variety sources of SRS data with a considerable record (> 5 years) of vegetation greenness and precipitation (input data); ii) operating an end-to-end system by exploiting AI-based models suited to time series analysis such as Seq2Seq and Transformers; iii) providing customised proxies informing the success or failure of a given local CCA intervention(s). 1 Introduction Adaptation in agriculture refers to the set of strategies used by individual farmers and land managers, sectors, industries and governments to minimise risk and reduce exposure to external perturbations [ 7]. Whilst there have been increases in global investment on climate change adaptation (CCA), these adaptation strategies can have both beneﬁcial and unintended detrimental consequences when a wider context or longer time frames are considered [ 5]. Consequently, it remains key to the development of rigorous analytical methods to fully assess the impact of adaptation measures, particularly across countries in the developing world that are the most vulnerable to climate change. Amongst the available data sources that would form the basis for such methodologies, Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) data can be considered the most suited due to their large-area coverage and relatively easy access [ 4]. SRS instruments such as the Moderate Resolution Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (A VHRR) have been mainly used to assess the impacts of drought on crop productivity [ 2]. These particular instruments have served as early warning systems that fundamentally compare current vegetation indices (VIs, measurements of greenness) to the long-term average [ 4]. The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), the ratio between near infrared and red light within the electromagnetic spectrum, is one of the most widely used VIs. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Following the plethora of SRS-based early warning systems for decision making, TAPAS \"Tracking Adaptation Progress in Agriculture and Food Security Using an AI-powered Satellite Remote Sensing Platform\" is a trans-disciplinary initiative aiming to enable countries to develop evidence-based means of measuring, reporting and verifying CCA in the agri-food sector with a particular focus on countries in the developing world that are the most vulnerable to climate change. TAPAS builds on the previous work of the System for Evaluation of Impact Using Remote Sensing (SEIRS) infrastructure. Since its inception, SEIRS has monitored U.S. Government-funded development programs particularly those involving interventions across cropping areas in Sub-Saharan Africa. Contributions. We will plan to extend the SEIRS platform so that a) it ingests and processes multi-source satellite time series data b) it will utilise AI-based models that can handle corrupt and incomplete data. We also propose new NDVI-derived products (proxies of crop yield) suited to indicate the status of a local CCA intervention. 2 Tracking Adaptation in Agriculture Using Satellite Remote Sensing 2.1 Background and Related Work SRS data streams have been key resources to monitor crop systems, their growing conditions, status, and agro-climatic conditions likely to impact them at national, regional and global scales [ 1]. Whilst SRS along with AI-based techniques have been widely explored to propose operational systems to measure and monitor the impact of climatic extremes e.g. droughts or ﬂoods on agri-food systems, few examples exist to inform and monitor the status of CCA strategies implemented on the ground. According to the above premise, the following sections aim to introduce SEIRS and describe the main contributions derived from this system to build a new one suited to the needs of TAPAS, and in general to the climate change community. The SEIRS Platform. SEIRS operates by modelling and analysing two SRS products, MODIS NDVI product (MOD13) and Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM), to predict differences in vegetation greenness according to computer model generated synthetic data and observed data. Five major steps are involved (see Figure 1) i) delimit cropping areas according to a crop mask extracted from existing land cover maps ii) reconstruct MODIS raw NDVI time series by using the Harmonic Analysis of NDVI Time Series (HANTS) algorithm [ 8]; iii) model both reconstructed NDVI and precipitation data by using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture; iv) evaluate the model according to generated synthetic data and orbit-derived observed data; and v) provide sets of NDVI-derived products suited to the analysis of U.S. Government-funded development programs.
