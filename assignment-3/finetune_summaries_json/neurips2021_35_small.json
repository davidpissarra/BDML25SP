This work tests multiple machine learning models to improve the state of AMV prediction from maps of sea surface temperature, salinity, and sea level pressure in the North Atlantic region. We use data from the Community Earth System Model 1 Large Ensemble Project, a state- of-the-art climate model with 3,440 years of data. Our results demonstrate that all of the models we use outperform the traditional persistence forecast baseline. Predicting the AMV is important for identifying future extreme temperatures and precipitation, as well as hurricane activity, in Europe and North America up to 25 years in advance. 1 Introduction The Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV, also known as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation) is a basin-wide fluctuation of sea-surface temperatures (SST) in the North Atlantic with a periodicity of approximately 60 to 70 years. AMV has broad societal impacts. The positive phase of AMV, for example, has been shown to be associated with anomalously warm summers in northern Europe and hot, dry summers in southern Europe[ 3], and increased hurricane activity [ 12]. These impacts highlight the importance of predicting extreme AMV states. The state of AMV is measured by the AMV Index (Figure 1 bottom right panel, black solid line), calculated by averaging sea-surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the entire North Atlantic basin. The spatial pattern of SST associated with a positive AMV phase is characterized with the maximum warming in the subpolar North Atlantic and a secondary maxima in the tropical Atlantic with minimum warming (or slightly cooling) in between. Notwithstanding the value of reliable prediction of AMV, progress in predicting AMV at decadal and longer time scales has been limited. Previous efforts have used the computationally expensive numerical climate models to perform seasonal to multi-year prediction with lead times of up to 10 years. The subpolar region in the North Atlantic has been shown to be one of the most predictable regions over the globe, and associated with the predictability of weather and climate in Europe and North America up to 10 years. An outstanding question is whether such predictability can be extended to prediction lead times longer than 10 years, particularly in a changing climate. Our objective is to predict these extreme states of the AMV using various oceanic and atmospheric fields as predictors. This is formulated as a classification problem, where years above and below 1 Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: Variability of input predictors, which include sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and sea level pressure. The prediction objectives (lower right) are strong positive (red) and negative (blue) AMV states outside 1 standard deviation of the AMV Index (dashed black line). The AMV spatial pattern from the CESM simulation reasonably captures the enhanced warming at subpolar and tropical latitudes. standard deviation of the AMV Index correspond to extreme warm and cold states. In this work, we use multiple ML models to explore the predictability of AMV up to 25 years in advance. Related Work. ML techniques have been successfully applied to predict climate variability, espe- cially the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). ENSO is an interannual mode of variability (each cycle is about 3-7 years) in the tropical Pacific Ocean. Several studies have used CNN to predict ENSO 12 to 16 months ahead using various features (e.g. SST, ocean heat content, sea surface height etc. [ 4,8,10]. This outperformed the typical 10-month lead time ENSO forecast with state-of-the-art, fully-coupled dynamical models [4]. However, little work has been done to predict decadal and longer modes of variability such as the AMV using ML. The biggest challenge is the lack of data. Widespread observational records for many variables are only available after the 1980s, limiting both the temporal extent and pool of predictors that may be used for training. For interannual modes such as ENSO, current observations can be easily partitioned into ample training and testing datasets with multiple ENSO cycles in each subset of data. However, a single AMV cycle requires 60-70 years, making it nearly impossible to train and test a neural network on observational data alone. 2 Data and Methods To remedy the lack of observational data for AMV, we used the Community Earth System Model version 1.1 Large Ensemble Simulations1.
