As these are highly variable in na- ture, the grid must be closely monitored so that system operators will have elevated situational awareness and can execute timely actions to maintain stable grid opera- tions. With the widespread deployment of sensors like phasor measurement units (PMUs), an abundance of data is available for conducting accurate state estimation. However, due to the cyber-physical nature of the power grid, measurement data can be perturbed in an adversarial manner to enforce incorrect decision-making. In this paper, we propose a novel reconstruction method that leverages on machine learning constructs like CGAN and gradient search to recover the original states when subjected to adversarial perturbations. Experimental studies conducted on the practical IEEE 118-bus benchmark power system show that the proposed method can reduce errors due to perturbation by large margins (i.e. up to 100%). 1 Introduction Climate change concerns are instigating major transformations in the way the modern power grid operates ( 1). These include the widespread integration of renewable generation systems, electric vehicles and storage systems along with ubiquitous connectivity enabled by information and commu- nication technologies (ICTs) ( 2) (3) (4). Although sustainable power entities are highly variable in nature (e.g. generation by renewables), with the aid of ICTs, system operators will have real-time monitoring and actuation capabilities for maintaining stable grid operations. However, the ICTs are associated with inherent communication and/or software vulnerabilities that can be leveraged by adversaries to mislead system operators in making incorrect decisions and the triggering of control systems that can lead to cascading outages in the grid (5) (6). Adversarial attacks on real power grids have taken place and these have been reported to have inﬂicted extensive losses and damages to the affected parties. For instance, cyber-attacks perpetuated in Ukraine in 2015 ( 7) and Venezuela in 2019 ( 8) resulted in extended power losses that lasted for days and affected hundreds of thousands of consumers. Another example is the security breach that occurred in Iran in 2011 ( 9). The Stuxnet worm was utilized to inﬁltrate Siemen’s SIMATIC winCC Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.monitoring and data acquisition systems and inﬂict costly damages to nuclear centrifuges of power generation systems in Iran. During this period, this worm was estimated to have infected 60% of PCs in Iran. Hence, cybersecurity is an important consideration for the smooth operation of the electric grid especially with the proliferation of low-carbon technologies. As such, one common mode of attack is false data injection (FDI) where sensor measurements generated by phasor measurement units (PMUs) are perturbed. When these measurements are utilized to estimate grid states, incorrect values will be produced ( 9). Although mechanisms for detecting these perturbations have been built into traditional state estimation processes (e.g. residual based techniques ( 10)), a seminal work published in reference ( 11) demonstrated that stealthy attacks leveraging on the null-space of the transformation from measurements to states can bypass these safeguards. There have been many advances in FDI attacks henceforth that aim to stealthily affect grid states so that incorrect control actions can be taken (12). As such, one important line of work that will reduce the impact of FDI attacks is the partial or full recovery of the original grid states when measurements are subjected to adversarial perturbations (e.g. ( 13)). The main issue with these is that details of the grid topology is necessary for the recovery process. This is conﬁdential information that can result in dire consequences if leaked to adversarial entities. With our proposal in this paper, our contributions are: 1) We leverage a cycle GAN (CGAN) model that captures the non-linear mappings of grid measurements to states and vice versa for detecting speciﬁc perturbed measurements; 2) We utilize the gradients computed using the trained model to iteratively recover the perturbed measurements; and 3) We demonstrate the efﬁcacy of the proposed reconstruction method on a benchmark IEEE 118 bus system. 2 Methodology We utilize CGAN ( 14) which is a generative machine learning model to learn the forward mapping G between grid measurements yand statesxand reverse mapping Hvice versa. y=G(x); x=H(y) The general architecture of CGAN is illustrated in Fig. 1. The CGAN is composed of two GANs - one for each direction of mapping. GANs are generally composed of a discriminator and generator. The two generators in the CGAN aims to learn GandHrespectively while the discriminators Dy andDxaim to distinguish whether its inputs are from the actual training datasets or synthesized by its generator pair. For brevity, we assume that the trained CGAN model is already available. Figure\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy and dirty parts removed:\n\nRenewable energy sources must be deployed in large quantities across the grid to ensure stable operations. However, their variable nature requires close monitoring to enable timely actions by system operators. The widespread use of sensors like phasor measurement units (PMUs) provides a wealth of data for accurate state estimation. Nevertheless, the cyber-physical nature of the power grid makes it vulnerable to adversarial attacks that can manipulate measurement data and lead to incorrect decision-making.\n\nThis paper proposes a novel reconstruction method that leverages machine learning constructs, such as cycle GAN (CGAN) and gradient search, to recover the original grid states when subjected to adversarial perturbations. Experimental studies on the IEEE 118-bus benchmark power system demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly reduce errors caused by perturbations (up to 100%).\n\nClimate change is driving significant transformations in the power grid, including the integration of renewable energy systems, electric vehicles, and storage systems, as well as ubiquitous connectivity enabled by information and communication technologies (ICTs). While ICTs provide real-time monitoring and actuation capabilities, they also introduce inherent communication and software vulnerabilities that can be exploited by adversaries to mislead system operators and trigger control systems that can lead to cascading outages.\n\nAdversarial attacks on real power grids have occurred, resulting in extensive losses and damages. For instance, cyber-attacks in Ukraine in 2015 and Venezuela in 2019 caused prolonged power outages affecting hundreds of thousands of consumers. Another example is the security breach in Iran in 2011, where the Stuxnet worm was used to infiltrate Siemens' monitoring and data acquisition systems, causing costly damages to nuclear centrifuges.\n\nCybersecurity is a critical consideration for the smooth operation of the electric grid, especially with the proliferation of low-carbon technologies.
