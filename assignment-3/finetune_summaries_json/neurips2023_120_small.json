We propose approaches to monitor and quantify sus- tainable development along the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), including mathematically derived scoring algorithms, and machine learning methods. These integrate socioeconomic and environmental datasets, to produce an interpretable metric for SSP alignment. An initial study demonstrates promising results, lay- ing the groundwork for the application of different methods to the monitoring of sustainable global development. 1 Introduction To address the ongoing climate crisis, global socioeconomic progress must be balanced with environ- mental sustainability. However, assessing a region’s overall development trajectory with this balance in mind poses a complex challenge. Progress is typically monitored with respect to warming limits of 1.5◦C and 2◦C using self-reported nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of emissions [ 7]. A study of European cities integrated environmental and socioeconomic datasets and applied machine learning techniques to assess emissions reduction efforts [ 3]. Despite substantial literature on country- level mitigation pathways, not all countries are well represented [ 7]. In climate change mitigation research, reference scenarios are used to evaluate possible low-carbon strategies; policymakers and researchers tend to focus on an individual scenario, which can limit the scope of understanding [2]. In 2017, the five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) were introduced: (1) Sustainability, (2) Middle of the Road, (3) Regional Rivalry, (4) Inequality, (5) Fossil-fueled Development [ 10,8]. These characterise the ways in which socioeconomic factors and atmospheric emissions may change in the coming century; analysis in 2020 identified over 1370 studies utilising the SSPs [ 9]. SSP projection datasets for complex, and sometimes competing, socioeconomic and environmental features are available from the year 2015, projected ahead to 2100. While the SSPs are presented as potential pathways, rather than ideal pathways or targets, they can be used to contextualise current development trajectories. With this in mind, the SSP projections can be compared to observational data to evaluate the development sustainability of different regions relative to the established SSPs. With an increasing Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.range of stakeholders using climate scenario information, it becomes ever more crucial to improve the communication of climate scenario research [ 9]. Thus, we propose the application of data science and machine learning methods to distill these existing datasets into a single, interpretable score. These methods will act as pivotal tools to assist decision-makers in addressing the climate crisis, and monitoring sustainable socioeconomic development. 2 Proposed methods Here we propose the distillation of environmental and socioeconomical features into a single inter- pretable metric, to evaluate development against established scenarios. We propose initial investiga- tion into mathematical methods: norm induced measures, to simply quantify the difference between observations and SSPs, and TraCE (Trajectory Counterfactual Explanation) scores [ 1], which treat SSPs as counterfactual instances; as well as exploration of machine learning methods to better capture complex relationships. Additionally, scores from independent methods can be ensembled, to more robustly quantify SSP alignment than any single approach. These methods can be applied at a range of spatial scales, from regional to global. 2.1 Norm induced measures Given a norm such as the Euclidean ∥f∥2=qR Ωf(x)2dx, we consider the difference between ground truth uiand target SSP vifor each feature ias the error ei=ui−vi. The norm measures the average error between truth and target by finding ∥ei∥over the domain of interest Ωiand dividing by time frame length (or discrete number of points). This measure is summed over all features (with weight wifor each feature), and divided by the sum of the weights to obtain a score: S=1 ∥w∥2nX i=1wi∥ei∥2 (1) This method allows for varying resolutions between features without interpolation. Weights can be selected to allow greater contribution of important measures to the score than other features. Using this method, if S= 0 = ⇒e= 0and therefore u=v, an SSP is followed perfectly. Sis therefore unbounded but strictly positive, with a larger value of Sindicating a larger value for eand therefore worse alignment with an SSP. Preliminary results are presented in Section 3, with all features equally weighted. 2.2 TraCE scores TraCE [ 1] outputs a score Sbetween −1and1, derived from the combination of an angle metric R1(xt, x′ t)and a distance metric R2(xt, x′ t), weighted by λ∈[0,1]: S(xt, x′ t) =λR1(xt, x′ t) + (1 −λ)R2(xt, x′\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
