There are multiple satellites in orbit and planned for launch in the next few years which can detect and quantify these emissions; however, to attribute methane emissions to their sources on the ground, a compre- hensive database of the locations and characteristics of emission sources worldwide is essential. In this work, we develop deep learning algorithms that leverage freely available high-resolution aerial imagery to automatically detect oil and gas infras- tructure, one of the largest contributors to global methane emissions. We use the best algorithm, which we call OGNet, together with expert review to identify the locations of oil reﬁneries and petroleum terminals in the U.S. We show that OGNet detects many facilities which are not present in four standard public datasets of oil and gas infrastructure. All detected facilities are associated with characteristics known to contribute to methane emissions, including the infrastructure type and the number of storage tanks. The data curated and produced in this study is freely available at http://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/ognet. 1 Introduction Methane is the second-largest contributor to climate warming after carbon dioxide and accounts for at least one-quarter of present-day warming [ 1]. Around a third of current global anthropogenic methane emissions arise from the fossil fuel sector, and reducing these emissions is critical to mitigate further warming in the near-term [ 2,3,4,5]. In the last decade, quantifying methane emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) sector has become a signiﬁcant area of research and interest to both governments and the O&G industry [ 6,7,8,9]. Recent progress in quantifying methane emissions from the O&G sector has been largely due to advancements in satellite-based observations [ 10,11,12,8,13]. Currently, multiple global mapping satellite missions (SCIAMACHY, GOSAT, TROPOMI) provide atmospheric methane concentrations data [ 14] and limited coverage satellites (GHGSat) can detect high emission rates from speciﬁc facilities [ 15]. Furthermore, a new satellite (MethaneSAT) planned for launch in 2022 will provide publicly-available methane emissions data made up of diffuse emission ﬁelds and point sources to help drive action towards reducing emissions and for companies and countries to track their emission reduction targets [16, 17]. \u0003Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020Figure 1: Example NAIP imagery of positive examples (top row) and negative examples (bottom row) in the dataset used for model development. The positive images capture oil reﬁneries, characterized by a large footprint and consistent features like large round storage tanks. The negative images consist of randomly sampled locations as well as objects and landscapes which look similar to oil reﬁneries. To attribute methane emissions detected by these satellites to facilities on the ground, a compre- hensive database of the locations and characteristics of O&G infrastructure worldwide is critically required. There have been prior efforts to construct public datasets of O&G facilities. The global O&G infrastructure database (GOGI) was curated by developing machine learning models to parse the web for publicly-listed instances of infrastructure, but this process leads to data gaps due to limitations with searching for records published online [ 18]. Other national programs which host O&G infrastructure data include the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) by the Department of Homeland Security [ 19], the U.S Energy Mapping System from the Energy Information Administration (EIA) [ 20], and the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) by the EPA [ 21]. The data sources for these programs include required reporting by facility operators and publicly available data, which may be outdated or have incomplete coverage [22]. The recent unprecedented availability of high-resolution satellite and aerial imagery, together with advancements in deep learning methods, offer a powerful opportunity to create high-quality, granular, and large-scale databases of global infrastructure [ 23,24]. Deep learning techniques have been increasingly utilized for automatically detecting objects in remotely sensed imagery, from building footprint detection [ 25] and urban land use classiﬁcation [ 26] to energy infrastructure classiﬁcation, including solar photovoltaics [ 27] and wind turbines [ 28]. Only recently have these models been deployed on high-resolution imagery to construct large-scale databases [27, 29]. In this work, we develop deep learning models to automatically detect O&G infrastructure in freely available aerial imagery. We deploy the best models in the full continental U.S. to map oil reﬁneries and petroleum terminals and attribute each facility with\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
