By applying advanced machine learning algorithms, we will improve the 7 accuracy and reliability of climate data, and fill gaps in current datasets to ensure 8 completeness. Ensuring availability of a continuous dataset is crucial for informed 9 decision-making in climate change adaptation. 10 1 Introduction 11 Data scarcity significantly hampers research and informed decision-making, particularly in the 12 context of climate change adaptation. In regions with low gauge density, the sparse distribution 13 of weather stations leads to large gaps in spatial data coverage, making it difficult to accurately 14 monitor and predict climate patterns. Poor data quality further exacerbates this issue, as unreliable 15 or inconsistent measurements can skew analyses and lead to incorrect conclusions. Additionally, 16 the inaccessibility of data, whether due to lack of infrastructure, economy, topographic barrier or 17 proprietary restrictions, limits the ability of researchers and policymakers to obtain comprehensive 18 datasets needed for robust climate modeling and risk assessment. Consequently, poor-quality and 19 data inaccessibility undermines efforts to develop effective adaptation strategies, leaving communities 20 more vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Addressing these data challenges is crucial for 21 enhancing the resilience of data-scarce regions. This issue is more challenging in the Choke Mountain 22 Watersheds (CMW), Ethiopia. The CMW located in the northwestern part of Ethiopia are vital 23 ecosystems that significantly contribute to the regional hydrology, agriculture, and biodiversity. This 24 mountainous area, characterized by diverse microclimates, significantly influences the climate and 25 the hydrological process of major river systems [ 1]. It is home to numerous major tributaries of 26 the transboundary Blue Nile River. It also inhabits over 150,000 people who rely heavily on mixed 27 farming and livestock for their livelihoods. The diverse ecosystems provide essential resources, 28 making accurate climate data crucial for effective climate change adaptation. Despite its importance, 29 there is a lack of high-resolution, continuous, and accurate climate data for research and development 30 activities. Currently there are about 35 weather stations installed in and around the CMW. The stations 31 are monitored by the Ethiopian Meteorology Institute (https://www.ethiomet.gov.et/). However, this 32 Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.data is still very sparse, lacks quality control and rigorous data validation. Traditional methods of 33 data collection are often limited by the regionâ€™s rugged terrain and limited accessibility. 34 To address this gap, this project proposes the development of a comprehensive climate dataset for 35 the CMW region by integrating artificial intelligence (machine learning) techniques with remote 36 sensing and reanalysis data. Some of the promising satellite-based and reanalysis products include 37 the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS; [ 2]), Integrated Multi- 38 satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG; [ 3]) and the Fifth generation ECMWF atmospheric reanalysis 39 (ERA5; [ 4]). The use of satellite data as input features significantly improves the temperature data 40 imputation or prediction accuracy of Random Forest and XGBoost machine learning algorithms [ 5]. 41 By combining these satellite-based datasets with ground-based observations, this project aims to 42 enhance data accuracy and improve the spatial and temporal coverage of data, thus facilitating 43 more precise modeling, forecasting, and decision-making for environmental management and policy 44 development in the region. In this work, we propose to address data-gaps of in-situ measurement 45 using integrated Random Forest (RF) and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) techniques, new data generation 46 for ungauged locations using Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTM) and forecasting. The 47 integration of these technologies will provide a comprehensive framework for real-time monitoring, 48 predictive analysis of climate change effects, and decision support in various sectors. 49 2 Methods 50 2.1 Integrated Random Forest Regression and k-Nearest Neighbor model development 51 We propose using an integrated Random Forest (RF) regression and k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) 52 approach for imputing missing in-situ data of rainfall and temperature. Studies have shown that 53 integrated RF and k-NN are effective methods for imputing missing in-situ data [ 6]. RF regression 54 leverages the ensemble learning technique of random forests to predict missing values by averaging 55 the predictions of multiple decision trees, thus enhancing accuracy and robustness [ 7,8]. On the 56 other hand, k-NN imputes missing values by identifying the k-nearest data points in the feature 57 space and averaging their values, making it particularly useful for datasets with complex, non-linear 58 relationships.
