Introduction\n\nThe availability of timely, representative data sets of stratospheric measurements is a key requirement for tackling climate change with machine learning. However, the measurement data are extremely sparse because sensing and data collection in the stratosphere is difficult and expensive. The stratosphere is very sparsely sensed. It lies approximately between 10 km and 50 km above Earth's surface. Important atmospheric phenomena such as jet streams, planetary waves, El Niño, solar cycles, and dynamic equilibrium of ozone have a stratospheric component. Climate science benefits from better stratospheric sensing. Most stratospheric weather data are indirectly sensed by satellites, producing less useful data than a direct measurement. Remote data require calibration using direct measurements to be used in weather models and are unavailable in many regions, e.g., regions covered with snow (Ingleby et al., 2016). Aircraft can directly measure the lower stratosphere; however, only a weather balloon can directly measure the upper stratosphere (Ingleby et al., 2016). Sensor-equipped weather balloons are fundamental to weather forecasting and stratospheric weather modeling (Dabberdt et al., 2003; Flores et al., 2013), but balloons currently produce little data. Each weather balloon carries a radiosonde, which is a package of sensors and radios that measures and transmits atmospheric temperature, pressure, relative humidity, wind speed, and wind direction (Dabberdt et al., 2003; Flores et al., 2013). Each radiosonde captures and records very little data. A balloon flight lasts around two hours, only during which measurements can occur (Dabberdt et al., 2003). Mission scarcity exacerbates data scarcity: there are only around 800 radiosonde stations worldwide, each launching balloons at most twice a day (Ingleby et al., 2016; Dabberdt et al., 2003). Recently, many stations across Asia and South America have scaled back to one launch per day (Durre et al., 2006; NOAA, 2019b).\n\nWe propose a framework using machine learning and multiple sensors that aims to increase the measurement efficiency of weather balloons. The key idea is to drop additional sensors, or minisondes, from the balloon throughout the flight such that the combined measurements provide maximum information with respect to the weather modeling. The minisondes can provide richer information locally around their release altitudes by sampling at a higher rate and by lingering longer due to their lightweight characteristics. Given that there are a limited number of minisondes available, we need decision-making mechanisms that balance the trade-off between the sensing requirements and the number of minisondes available. The machine learning questions center around the goal of (1) characterizing the value-of-deployment (VOD) of the minisondes, which is the value that each minisondes contributes to the overall measurement efficiency.\n\nFigure 1: (Left) Releasing sensors (minisondes) from the balloon enhances the measurements by widening the coverage in space and time.
