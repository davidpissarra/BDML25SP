Considering recent advancements in deep neural networks, it is worthwhile to tackle this problem as data-driven spatio- temporal prediction using neural networks. However, a nontrivial challenge in practice lies in irregular time gaps between which climate observation data are collected due to sensor errors and other issues. This paper proposes an approach for spatio-temporal hurricane prediction that can address this issue of irregular time gaps in collected data with a simple but robust end-to-end model based on Neural Ordinary Differential Equation and video prediction model based on Ret- rospective Cycle GAN. 1 I NTRODUCTION Predicting extreme climate events is a pressing and challenging problem that humanity has faced. To make things worse, global warming is changing a developing mechanism and life cycle of extreme climate events. Recent studies show that hurricanes occur increasingly frequently and grow rapidly due to global warming (Emanuel, 2017; Mousavi et al., 2011; Pielke Jr et al., 2005; Schulthess et al., 2018). Thus, it is becoming important to understand dynamics of extreme climate events for accurate and fast prediction. Traditionally, we have relied on extensive physics-based simulation to predict extreme climate events. Large-scale physics simulation produces high-resolution data, which enables us to ex- plore future scenarios of extreme climate events. However, it is challenging to apply conventional simulation-based methods at a large scale. Speciﬁcally, extreme climate events simulation requires exa-scale computing even in moderate resolution. (Hardiker, 1997; Vetter, 2019) Also, global scale of climate data from simulation makes identiﬁcation and quantitative assessment of extreme climate events difﬁcult, especially when the events are locally nested in a small region of space and time, such as a hurricane. Thanks to the dramatic development of deep learning, a climate research community has made signiﬁcant progress in developing models to solve spatio-temporal nowcasting problem of climate events by applying various neural network models (Shi et al., 2017; 2015; Agrawal et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019a;b). Considering temporal dynamics of climate patterns, most of the existing approaches formulate climate nowcasting as a video prediction problem and applied recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to predict the next timestep based on previous timesteps (Shi et al., 2017; 2015; Kim et al., 2019b;a). \u0003These authors contributed equally. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Figure 1: Overview of our proposed model. RNN-based models, however, have serious drawback on climate event nowcasting, as they inherently assume regular time steps between adjacent time steps. Although this is a reasonable assumption for some other domain such as text, it does not often hold with climate data. First of all, climate data are measured intermittently (e.g., for hours), but we often want to predict in ﬁner temporal resolution for nowcasting. Also, observations are missing frequently. Thus, it is nontrivial to apply vanilla RNN models to this problem. Also, longer-term prediction is extremely challenging with a naive RNN- based model, as the quality of prediction in test-time is gradually degraded along the prediction time. To address these challenges in physics-based and RNN-based methods, we propose a Neural- ODE-based hurricane nowcasting model, that is (1) computationally more efﬁcient, and that can (2) handle input and output with irregular time steps. Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations) (Chen et al., 2018) is a recently proposed model that can learn representation of an irregularly sampled sequence data. Speciﬁcally, it parameterizes the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers.

Given recent advancements in deep neural networks, it is worthwhile to tackle this problem using data-driven spatio-temporal prediction. However, a non-trivial challenge lies in irregular time gaps between climate observation data due to sensor errors and other issues.

Global warming is changing the mechanism and life cycle of extreme climate events, making it increasingly frequent and rapid (Emanuel, 2017; Mousavi et al., 2011; Pielke Jr et al., 2005; Schulthess et al., 2018). To understand dynamics of extreme climate events accurately and quickly, it is essential to develop a reliable prediction method. Traditionally, physics-based simulations have been used to predict extreme climate events, producing high-resolution data that enables exploration of future scenarios. However, applying conventional simulation-based methods at a large scale is challenging, as it requires exascale computing even at moderate resolution (Hardiker, 1997; Vetter, 2019). Moreover, global climate data from simulations makes identification and quantitative assessment of extreme climate events difficult, especially when events are locally nested in a small region of space and time, such as a hurricane.\n\nThanks to the development of deep learning, the climate research community has made significant progress in developing models to solve the spatio-temporal nowcasting problem of climate events using various neural network models (Shi et al., 2017; 2015; Agrawal et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019a; b).

However, RNN-based models have a serious drawback in climate event nowcasting, as they assume regular time steps between adjacent time steps, which is not often the case with climate data. Climate data are measured intermittently (e.g., for hours), but we often want to predict in finer temporal resolution for nowcasting. Observations are frequently missing, making it non-trivial to apply vanilla RNN models to this problem. Moreover, longer-term prediction is extremely challenging with a naive RNN-based model, as the quality of prediction in test-time is gradually degraded along the prediction time.\n\nTo address these challenges in physics-based and RNN-based methods, we propose a Neural-ODE-based hurricane nowcasting model that is (1) computationally more efficient and (2) can handle input and output with irregular time steps. Neural ODE (Ordinary Differential Equations) (Chen et al., 2018) is a recently proposed model that can learn the representation of an irregularly sampled sequence data.

The main contributions are:\n\n* Continuous timestep prediction: Guided by the motion information of the hurricane at an arbitrary time point in the future predicted by Neural-ODE, our proposed model can deal with climate data with irregular time steps. Specifically, our model can predict future frames after an arbitrary timestep given input with irregular timesteps.\n* Computationally efficient: In the trade-off between computational cost and accuracy, our proposed model is more efficient than traditional methods."
