Yet, many 13 cities are lacking direction toward a climate-positive and sustainable future. The latest IPCC report 14 has underlined the role of international climate networks between urban centers [ 1], [2] such as city 15 networks. The main limitation to achieving efficient city networks is that many cities are relatively 16 small and lack the resources to know what solution set is most appropriate for them and how to 17 connect to other cities to share their stories and journey toward sustainability. This is problematic 18 as smaller cities face different barriers from their global counterparts [ 3], and these cities are likely 19 to define urbanization’s future, especially in the Global South [ 4]. This paper directly addresses 20 this dichotomy by using machine learning to develop a global classification approach for cities 21 into various profiles based on quantitative characteristics that can enhance the understanding of 22 urbanization pathways. 23 Related Work: Most cities’ classification studies have mostly focused on hierarchical data-driven 24 methods and do not move beyond comparing a limited number of cities with territorial similarities or 25 development levels [ 5]. To our knowledge, a clustering approach for cities worldwide has not been 26 fully explored in the literature to date. Such global classification has been challenging due to the lack 27 of available data on a global scale. Thus, this paper develops a novel data set and a broad definition 28 of city boundaries to develop a clustering approach for 9000 cities worldwide. The work presented in 29 this paper is divided into two key components. First, the development of global prediction models for 30 resource use (energy, water, food) for 9000 cities globally to fulfill the current gap in data needs to 31 achieve inclusive clustering of cities. Second, a novel clustering approach that performs better than 32 Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.baseline clustering and identifies possible city networks that can aid in the global climate change 33 discussion needs and resource efficiency opportunities. 34 2 Data and Methods 35 2.0.1 Data 36 In this paper, we developed a machine learning approach to predict energy, water, and food consump- 37 tion for a total of 9,000 cities around the world. This data - for a comprehensive 9000 cities around 38 the world - simply does not exist. Thus, we collected resource data for a subset of cities around 39 the world and processed each dataset to construct our predictive models. For further information 40 regarding the data, methods, and evaluations, refer to appendices A, B. Figure 2 portrays our decision 41 flow process with picking the best resource estimation model. 42 2.0.2 Methods 43 Energy Consumption Model : To generate a comprehensive energy estimation model, we used city 44 light radiance as a proxy. We found that city light radiance captured in satellite images approximates 45 well the energy consumption of cities, so we employed a city light radiance proportion model that 46 estimates the consumption of a specific city based on the city’s light radiance percentage of the whole 47 country multiplied by the country’s population proportion and total energy consumption following 48 previous work in [ 6], [7], [8] using equation 1. Our model selection analysis is presented in appendix 49 A.2 50 Ecapita/city i =Lcity i Lcountry j×Pcountry j Pcity i∗Ecapita/country j (1) Licorresponds to light radiance, Pito population, Eito energy, and Ejto National Average Energy 51 consumption for country jthat includes city i. 52 Water Consumption Model : To remedy the lack of observational data for water consumption, we 53 limited our model search space to models that work well with little data. Inspired by Fan et al. [ 9], we 54 performed feature selection to pick a subset of features that first, accurately depict water consumption, 55 second, are generalizable enough to be used for 9,000 cities. For example, the number of washing 56 machines per household was used in [ 9], but could not be used\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
