Yet they remain a source of great uncertainty in climate models and future climate projec- tions. In this work, we create a new observational constraint of regime-dependent ice microphysical properties at the spatio-temporal coverage of geostationary satel- lite instruments and the quality of active satellite retrievals. We achieve this by training a convolutional neural network on three years of SEVIRI and DARDAR data sets. This work will enable novel research to improve ice cloud process un- derstanding and hence, reduce uncertainties in a changing climate and help assess geoengineering methods for cirrus clouds. 1 Introduction Clouds containing ice particles cover 22 % of Earth’s surface at any moment [ 9]. They modulate incoming and outgoing radiation [ 14] and contribute to the majority of global precipitation [ 18]. Yet, we lack understanding about cloud formation and evolution which leads to large uncertainties in climate projections. Clouds containing ice particles can be distinguished into cirrus clouds and mixed-phase clouds. Cirrus clouds contain only ice crystals, are typically optically thin, occur at high altitudes at temperatures below -38 °C [20], and have on average a warming effect [ 9]. Mixed-phase clouds contain a mix of ice crystals and supercooled cloud droplets. They are thicker and usually exert a cooling effect [ 11]. Key to process understanding are properties such as ice water content (IWC) and ice water path (IWP). The former is a measure of the ice mass per unit volume and is vertically resolved while the latter is its integration along a vertical column. Ice properties are projected to change in a warming climate and may amplify or dampen global warming [16]. Current observational constraints are mainly two types of satellite retrievals. On the one hand, multiple studies e.g. [ 13,21,10] have used polar-orbiting active satellite instruments like CALIPSO’s lidar [ 23] and CloudSat’s radar [ 22] to analyze microphysical properties of ice clouds. These instru- ments retrieve cloud properties by emitting electromagnetic waves and measuring the backscattered signal. The main benefit is that active instruments are able to provide a vertical profile of cloud structures. Due to the narrow swath of the satellite overpass CALIPSO and CloudSat have a revisiting time of 16 days which is a much coarser temporal scale than necessary for studying clouds where processes act between seconds to hours [ 17]. In this work, we will use the DARDAR [ 3] data set which combines CALIPSO and CloudSat retrievals. On the other hand, passive geostationary satellite instruments such as SEVIRI onboard the Meteosat satellite [ 2] retrieve a top-down 2D view of Earth’s Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.surface every 15 minutes by measuring the reflected solar radiation and intensities of terrestrial infrared radiation. Previous studies have combined geostationary and actively sensed retrievals for IWP predictions [1, 12], but the context of cloud regime was not considered unlike in this work. The objective here is to provide regime-dependent IWP with high spatio-temporal coverage. To this end, we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) that predicts IWP for cirrus and mixed-phase clouds from SEVIRI data which is supervised by co-located IWP retrievals from DARDAR. Unlike previous work, the model proposed here provides insight into both ice regimes independently. 2 Dataset Figure 1: 10 µm channel for single SEVIRI observation from 2007- 10-24 00:12:43 with co-located DARDAR IWP. Note that the DARDAR swath is magnified for better visibility.The dataset used for this study contains three years of multi-spectral images from SEVIRI and vertically-resolved DARDAR IWC swaths. We identify the matching DARDAR overpasses for every SEVIRI image and resample them to the native SEVIRI horizontal resolution of 3km x 3km. Due to the high temporal resolution of 15 minutes and the long revisiting times of DARDAR, any SEVIRI image contains at most one DARDAR overpass, resulting in a minor fraction of a given SEVIRI image that can be co-located with DARDAR data. Note, that many SEVIRI images do not contain any DARDAR overpass. Figure 1 visualizes an exemplary SEVIRI image with its matching DARDAR swath. Instead of using the whole vertical column of DARDAR IWC as target data, we integrate the IWC for cirrus and mixed-phase regimes resulting in an ice-reg\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
