The main objective is to determine optimal parameters for transportation simulations to increase public transport usage and reduce individual vehicle re- liance. Initial experiments were conducted on a simplified transportation scenario, and results indicate that RL can effectively find system interventions that increase public transit usage and decrease transportation emissions. 1 Introduction The transportation sector is a primary driver of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [ 6]. Presently, technological advancements are catalyzing a monumental shift in transportation, transitioning the energy source from mainly fossil fuels to electric power. As a consequence, there’s an imminent need to reevaluate our current infrastructure, build new capabilities, and formulate progressive policies. In the last years, extensive data gathering and advances in modeling have enhanced our capability to forecast mobility trends. Techniques such as agent-based modeling (ABM) and simulation are now increasingly used for transportation scenario evaluations [5]. Public transportation will play a pivotal role in reducing GHG emissions in any future transportation scenario. Modern public transit vehicles tend to be more energy-efficient per passenger compared to private vehicles. If more individuals opt for public transit, it could also lead to a notable reduction in traffic congestion, subsequently leading to fewer cars idling and releasing GHGs [ 15]. The reduced dependence on private vehicles not only lowers the emissions from their direct use but also from their production, maintenance, and disposal. Additionally, public transport systems foster more compact, pedestrian-friendly urban developments, facilitating shorter, less carbon-intensive trips [ 13]. Infrastructure-wise, transportation methods like subways and light rail require less land than roads meant for personal vehicles, offering potential carbon sequestration if the saved land is employed for environmental purposes. Furthermore, it is more feasible to transition large-scale public transport systems, such as buses or trains, to renewable energy sources like solar or wind than transitioning millions of individual cars, making public transport even greener as our energy grids evolve. ∗equal contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.In this paper, we are interested in the question of how we can utilize reinforcement learning (RL) [14] to build a tool that can ultimately serve to assist urban planners. For this purpose, we used theBehavior, Energy, Automation, and Mobility (BEAM) [12] transportation simulation framework developed at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory combined with the Berkeley Integrated System for Transportation Optimization (BISTRO) [2] scenario and optimization wrapper, and built an RL environment that allowed us to perform system interventions in parallel, de-centralized simulation runs. The resulting framework allows us to train agents that are capable of optimizing transportation objectives based on a given metric under fixed behavior and transit profiles for individual agents. In this initial experiments, we are limiting our focus on a simplified transportation scenario with few action dimensions to show the feasibility of the approach. 2 Agent-based modeling with BEAM and BISTRO ABM frameworks [ 1] have evolved as a valuable tool with growing capabilities and versatility to interactively estimate the effect of different actions and interventions in communities. Based on real-world data, ABMs allow city planners to model a given city or district based around its existing transportation and energy infrastructure, population, and vehicular make-up. Starting from an existing model, different interventions to the existing infrastructure can be applied and simulations of how the population is affected by these interventions are carried out. Those tools allow us to anticipate several aspects of policy or infrastructure interventions, e.g., how people adjust their mode preferences and movement patterns, how EV charging affects the energy grid and transit, and in general anticipate demand changes for public transport, road usage and the electrical grid. For our experiments, we are using BEAM and BISTRO; BEAM is an agent-based transportation simulation framework which can investigate the impacts of new and emerging forms of transportation and BISTRO provides a Python based interface to BEAM to enable scenario development and an optimization framework to identify system interventions that best align with policy and planning objectives. BISTRO can be leveraged for activity-based travel models that integrates optimization algorithms to automate the search for potential optimal policy parameters evaluated on sets of defined Key Performance Indicators (KPI) over the diverse transportation system, such as congestion, travel cost, and GHG emissions.
