Forecasting models are limited by computational costs and therefore often can only make coarse resolution predictions. Statistical downscaling can provide an efficient method of upsampling low-resolution data. In this field, deep learning has been applied successfully, often using image super- resolution methods from computer vision. Despite achieving visually compelling results in some cases, such models often violate conservation laws when predicting physical variables. In order to conserve important physical quantities, we developed a deep downscaling method that guarantees physical constraints are satisfied, by adding a renormalization layer at the end of the neural network. Furthermore, the constrained model also improves the performance according to standard metrics. We show the applicability of our methods across different popular architectures and upsampling factors using ERA5 reanalysis data. 1 Introduction Accurate modeling of weather and climate is critical for taking effective action to combat climate change. In addition to shaping global understanding of climate change, local and regional predictions shape adaptation decisions and provide impetus for action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Predicted and observed quantities such as precipitation, wind speed, and temperature impact decisions in fields like agriculture, energy, and transportation. While these quantities are often required at a fine geographical and temporal scale to ensure informed decision making, most climate and weather models are extremely computationally expensive to run, resulting in coarse-resolution predictions, while observations are often sparsely available. Thus, there is a need for fast methods that can generate high-resolution data based on the low-resolution models that are commonly available. The terms downscaling in climate science and super-resolution (SR) in machine learning (ML) refer to learning a mapping between a low-resolution (LR) input sample and a high-resolution (HR) version of that sample. Downscaling via established statistical methods— statistical downscaling — has been long used by the climate science community to increase the resolution of climate data Maraun and Widmann [2018]. In parallel, computer vision SR has evolved rapidly using various deep learning architectures, with such methods now including super-resolution convolutional neural Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.networks (CNNs) Dong et al. [2016], generative adversarial models (GANs) Wang et al. [2018], vision transformers Yang et al. [2020], and normalizing flows Lugmayr et al. [2020]. Increasing the temporal resolution via frame interpolation is also an active area of research for video enhancement Liu et al. [2017] that can be transferred to spatio-temporal climate data. Recently, deep learning approaches have been applied to a variety of climate and weather datasets, covering both model output data and observations. Climate super-resolution has mostly focused on CNNs Vandal et al. [2017], recently shifting towards GANs Stengel et al. [2020]. Generating high-resolution data with machine learning can produce realistic-looking images and good predictive accuracy. However, a major obstacle often encountered when applying ML to a physical system such as the Earth’s atmosphere is that the predicted output values can violate physical laws such as conservation of energy, momentum, and moisture. More broadly, there are numerous domains of ML for societal benefit in which satisfaction of physical constraints is fundamentally important. Examples include the discovery of new materials for energy and healthcare, aerodynamics simulations for efficient vehicles, and optimal control in industrial settings. To the best of our knowledge, there is no published work on hard-constrained ML models for SR/downscaling, but there exist related work. In super-resolution of turbulent flows, Mesh- freeFlowNet Jiang et al. [2020] employs a physics-informed model adding partial differential equa- tions as regularization terms to the loss function. A preprint Geiss and Hardin [2020] introduces an enforcement operator applied to multiple CNN architectures for scientific datasets while another more recent preprint applies that method to atmospheric chemistry model downscaling using a CNN Geiss et al. [2022]. In this work, we introduce a novel method to strictly enforce physical constraints between low- resolution (input) and high-resolution (output) images.
