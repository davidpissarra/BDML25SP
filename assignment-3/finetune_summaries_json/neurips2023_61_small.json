This study delves into this emerging trend, presenting our methodologies and outcomes. We harnessed the UK’s local ERA5 850 hPa temperature data and refined the U-STN12 global weather forecasting model, tailoring its predictions to the UK’s climate nuances. From the ASOS network, we sourced T2mdata, repre- senting ground observations across the UK. We employed the advanced kriging method with a polynomial drift term for consistent spatial resolution. Furthermore, Gaussian noise was superimposed on the ERA5 T850 data, setting the stage for ensuing multi-time step synthetic observations. Probing into the assimilation im- pacts, the ASOS T2m data was integrated with the ERA5 T850 dataset. Our insights reveal that while global forecast models can adapt to specific regions, incorporating atmospheric data in DA significantly bolsters model accuracy. Conversely, the direct assimilation of surface temperature data tends to mitigate this enhancement, tempering the model’s predictive prowess. 1 Introduction Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) has progressed over the decades, establishing itself as a cornerstone in weather forecasting [ 22]. Its efficacy, demonstrated across diverse environmental scenarios, provides probabilistic forecasts [ 15]. Among various NWP models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) IFS (Integrated Forecasting System) is consistently recognised for its accurate representation of atmospheric conditions in designated geographical areas [ 18]. While it maintains a lead over machine learning (ML) models, the rise of ML-driven models — with their refined designs and increasing resolutions — cannot be overlooked [ 17]. These models leverage historical atmospheric data, aspiring to match or surpass IFS predictions while conserving computational resources and boosting processing speeds. This includes resolutions from 5.625 degrees in the WeatherBench Convolution Neural Network (CNN) series [ 16] to 1.0 degree in Keisler’s Graph Neural Network (GNN) model [ 10] and 0.25 degree in GraphCast [ 12]. Even though ML model developers do not anticipate replacing NWP entirely, the strides made in ML suggest its capacity to refine existing forecasting approaches [ 12]. In recent years, the integration of data-driven ML models and Data Assimilation (DA) techniques has attracted substantial attention due to its potential to enhance model performance [ 3]. DA serves as an intermediary, merging observational 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).data with model outputs to hone initial backgrounds, thereby fostering improved forecast results. Integrating obervational data in a NWP is not trivial as the model needs to be restarted from new initial conditions [ 4]. Integrating new observational data in an ML model through fine-tuning via DA has been shown to be very effective [ 6]. In the domain of atmospheric research, 850 hPa temperature (T850 ) and 500 hPa geopotential height ( Z500 ) are fundamental datasets. Their significance stems from their representation of large-scale circulation in the troposphere, which inherently affects near- surface weather conditions and extremities [ 5]. The objective of weather forecasting is to predict the future state of the atmosphere for a designated time [ 16]. However, this forecasting is confined to the atmosphere’s prediction horizon, estimated to be approximately two weeks [20]. In this study, we not only used data from ERA5 and the ASOS network but also incorporated global meteorological data from the U-STN model. ML models excel at handling heterogeneous data from multiple sources. They can automatically identify correlations between different datasets and effectively integrate this information, which is crucial for improving DA outcomes. Weather systems are highly complex and nonlinear. ML models, especially deep learning models, are adept at capturing this complexity, providing a finer understanding compared to traditional numerical weather prediction models. One key advantage of ML models is their ability to adapt and respond to changes in new data. This means that as we collect more meteorological data and real-time observations, the models can continuously self-optimize and adjust, thereby enhancing long-term prediction accuracy. 2 Methods In this study, we adapted a global weather forecasting model [ 5] employing a U-Net [ 19] enhanced with a deep spatial transformer (U-STN) and focused on a single data variable. This model was specifically retrained for the UK region.
