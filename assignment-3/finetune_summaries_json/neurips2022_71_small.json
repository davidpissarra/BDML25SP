PyroCbs are associated with unpredictable, and therefore dangerous, wildfire spread. They can also inject smoke particles and trace gases into the upper tropo- sphere and lower stratosphere, affecting the Earth’s climate. As global temperatures increase, these previously rare events are becoming more common. Being able to predict which fires are likely to generate pyroCb is therefore key to climate adaptation in wildfire-prone areas. This paper introduces PYROCAST, a pipeline for pyroCb analysis and forecasting. The pipeline’s first two components, a pyroCb database and a pyroCb forecast model, are presented. The database brings together geostationary imagery and environmental data for over 148 pyroCb events across North America, Australia, and Russia between 2018 and 2022. Random Forests, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and CNNs pretrained with Auto-Encoders were tested to predict the generation of pyroCb for a given fire six hours in advance. The best model predicted pyroCb with an AUC of 0.90±0.04. 1 Introduction More than 17 million people have been affected and USD 144 billion lost through major wildfire events over the last 30 years [ 6]. In addition, the degradation of air quality due to the creation of aerosols and ozone from fires results in between 260 000 and 600 000 premature deaths each year [ 8]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.The risk posed by wildfires to people and the environment is increasing due to climate change. By the end of the century, the frequency of wildfires, compared to a 2000 – 2010 reference period, is predicted to increase by a factor of 1.31to1.57with the number of extreme wildfires increasing even further [25, 2]. Pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) clouds are produced by large and intense wildfires [ 13,19]. PyroCbs create their own weather fronts which can make wildfire behaviour unpredictable through strong winds and ignite new fires through lightning strikes [ 16]. PyroCbs also inject wildfire aerosols and trace gases into the stratosphere where they remain for several months [ 16,28,15]. These events, which can be on the scale of a volcanic eruption, have important impacts on the Earth’s climate, e.g., through direct absorption of solar radiation or cloud formation [ 10,24,9]. PyroCbs could also hinder the recovery of the ozone layer [18, 20]. Despite the risk posed by pyroCbs, the conditions leading to their occurrence and evolution are still poorly understood. Previous pyroCb research has generally been limited to the study of occurrences linked to single wildfire events or over a limited study areas. Geostationary and local weather information has been used to characterise the properties of these clouds [ 23,12] and to create an empirical thresholding algorithm to detect pyroCb from GOES17 satellite imagery [ 13]. This paper presents a machine learning pipeline named ‘ PYROCAST ’, with the aim of monitoring, forecasting, and understanding the drivers behind pyroCb events. This pipeline will aid scientists to systematically research pyroCb, as well as help policymakers and emergency services efficiently allocate resources and evacuate residents and emergency responders. PYROCAST1is made up of three components: 1.A database (Section 2) containing labelled geostationary satellite images, meteorologi- cal, and fuel data associated with individual wildfire events. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the database is the most comprehensive pyroCb database published to date. 2.A forecast model (Section 3), a Random Forest (RF) model that can predict pyroCb occur- rence from a wildfire over a six-hour horizon. This is the first model that attempts to forecast pyroCb and the first application of machine learning to this field. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and CNNs pretrained with Auto-Encoders (AE-CNNs) are also explored in this study. 3.A causal discovery framework, a set of tools to understand the characteristics and causes of pyroCb published in a companion paper [ 3]. This is the first attempt to create a causal model for pyroCb formation. 2 P YROCAST Database To create the PYROCAST database, historical pyroCb events were manually collated from blogs and sparse databases including the Australian PyroCb registry [ 11], the CIMSS PyroCb Blog [ 17],\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
