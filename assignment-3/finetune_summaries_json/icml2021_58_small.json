In this study, our goal is to optimize those energy exchanges to maximize the renew- able energy penetration within the community using machine learning techniques. Future house- hold electricity consumption is predicted using machine learning from the past time series. The predicted consumption is used to determine the next energy-exchange strategy, i.e. when and how much energy should be exchanged to minimize the surplus of solar energy. The simulation results show that the proposed method can increase the amount of renewable energy penetration within the community. 1. Introduction In recent years, improvements in the technology and reductions to the cost of distributed energy resources (DERs) have led to a rise in popularity of on-site energy sources and storage such as solar panels and batteries (Creara, 2015). To utilize the energy generated by DERs effectively, energy sharing methods between these DERs has been proposed (Zhou et al., 2021; Spasova et al., 2019; Mengelkamp et al., 2017; Wang & Huang, 2016). By sharing electricity between DERs, it is possible to minimize transmission distances, increase resilience to *Equal contribution1Sony Computer Science Laboratories Inc., Tokyo, Japan2Integrated Open Systems Unit, Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology, Okinawa, Japan.

For stable operation of the power system, it is necessary to maintain the balance between energy demand and supply. Researches have been conducted on forecasts of energy demand and supply in order to efﬁciently manage the balance of power system (Aslam et al., 2020; del Real et al., 2020; Kuo & Huang, 2018; Ruiz-Cort ´es et al., 2019). While accurate prediction techniques have been proposed in these studies, no concrete proposals have been made for the control of power systems using the energy prediction results. Especially in the control of DERs, batteries play an essential role for stabilizing intermittent renewable energy generation, and it is important to optimize the energy balancing between these batteries using energy prediction results. In this paper, machine learning techniques are used to predict next-day energy consumption to make SoC forecasts of individual prosumers. Surplus energy is predicted from state-of-charge (SoC) forecasts, and an energy-exchange strategy is created to share surpluses with neighbors. The open energy system (OES) is a peer-to-peer energy-exchange technology operating in a real-world microgrid in Okinawa, Japan (Werth et al., 2018). Simulation is based on this real system and shows that the individual optimal scenario for minimizing surplus energy leads to an increase in both individual and overall renewable penetration. 2. Microgrid Architecture and battery SoC management The OES is a bottom-up, distributed energy system that mainly uses renewable energy sources. It consists of mul- tiple subsystems with solar panels, batteries, and DC/DC converters, which are interconnected by a communication line and DC grid, as shown on the left side of Fig. 1. Each subsystem has an energy-exchange scenario that describes the SoC targets of the day, as shown on the right side of Fig. 1. If the SoC is lower than the target, the subsystem requests energy charging. If the SoC is higher than the tar- get, subsystem requests energy discharging. The requestSubmission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2021 is negotiated between the subsystems, and if the negotia- tion succeeds, the energy exchange is executed between the concerned subsystems. Instead of a system-wide opti- mization, the OES uses best-effort control logic with local optimization that does not require global knowledge. Figure 1. OES structure 3. Machine learning for future SoC target The energy exchange among subsystems is indirectly con- trolled through a scenario that describes the SoC target. Currently, in the OES, SoC targets are set in accordance with the daily demand of households with a constant value for 24 hours. However, if the SoC target for each time slot can be set independently, a more ﬂexible energy-exchange strategy could be executed in accordance with the energy conditions for each time slot. In this paper, machine learn- ing is used to predict future surplus amounts and times of solar energy. Then, the SoC target is set to discharge the battery before the surplus occurs, and energy exchanges are executed on the basis of the SoC target. Fig, 2 shows the scenario-generation algorithm using machine learning. The scenario is generated for each subsystem using the following method. Figure 2.
