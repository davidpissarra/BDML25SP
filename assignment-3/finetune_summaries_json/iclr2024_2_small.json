Using stratified data from the USDA Rapid Carbon Assessment (RaCA), we demonstrate a method to improve model generalization out-of-distribution by training SOC regression alongside models that reconstruct input spec- tra. Because hyperspectra can be collected from remote platforms such as drones and satellites, this approach raises the possibility of using large hy- perspectral Earth observation datasets to transfer SOC inference models to remote geographies where geographically-dense ground-truth data collection may be expensive or impossible. By replacing the decoder with a simple physics-informed model, we also learn an interpretable spectral signature of SOC, confirming its dark hue and expected reflectance troughs. Finally, we show that catastrophic generalization failures can be better addressed with these architectures by fine-tuning on large quantities of hyperspectral data. 1 Introduction Modern intensive agriculture yields direct greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption, fertilizer production, livestock husbandry, and land use change, accounting for roughly 20% of global anthropogenic contributions to climate change ( 1). An avenue of significant interest to decarbonize agriculture is to augment organic carbon stored in agricultural soils through local shifts in farming practices. Approaches that have been tested include zero- or reduced-tillage, cover cropping, and crop residue utilization ( 2). Such practices can bolster the interactions of plants’ root systems with bugs and microorganisms, leading to increased deposition of carbon from the atmosphere into soil ( 2;3;4). However, measurements to verify that these sustainable practices have their intended effects on soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are prohibitively expensive to apply to large areas of land ( ∼$15-25 USD/sample) ( 5;6). These steep costs have motivated investigation into more scalable approaches for SOC inference. In this work, we investigate hyperspectral imaging (HSI) as a candidate procedure to scale SOC measurement. The standard technique to measure SOC content requires combusting soil to determine its total carbon content, and mixing it with acid to determine its inorganic carbon content (stored in the form of carbonate minerals). SOC is the difference between these quantities ( 7). Relative to this laboratory procedure, HSI is non-destructive, reagent- free, emissions-free, and may be performed in situor remotely, via drone or satellite ( 8). However, existing analyses involve end-to-end regression between measured spectra and laboratory SOC measurements which, as we show in this work, can drastically fail when 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Autoencoder in the physics-informed case (see appendix B). A soil spectrum R(λ)is used to predict endmember mass fractions ⃗ mvia a differentiable process (here, a fully-connected multi-layer perceptron). To preserve physical interpretability, a correction is applied, converting ˆmkto mixing ratios αkfor pure endmember spectra fk. The αkandfk are then combined to reconstruct an estimate ˆR(λ)of the original R(λ). In the end-to-end approach, the decoder model is replaced by an ANN using ˆmi,kas input features. applied outside of their sampling distributions (OOD) (see appendix A for related work). Such inabilities to generalize undermine the feasibility of applying HSI to SOC measurement. Methods to reliably transfer SOC inference models based on HSI data, i.e. requiring minimal combustion data, are thus of major interest. We demonstrate how to better achieve this goal by training models for SOC measurement alongside models which reconstruct the original input spectrum. A major benefit of our approach is that it permits training models using hyperspectral data alone, which may enable the global scaling of SOC measurement via HSI thanks to emerging capabilities in continuous hyperspectral Earth observation (9; 10). We present 3 novel contributions: (1) A method for soil property analysis which uses spectral reconstruction as an auxiliary loss to enable the use of unlabeled data during training; (2) An application of this architecture which backs out an interpretable reference spectrum for SOC using physical priors; and (3) a replicable empirical study using a cleaned dataset, which demonstrates the failure of SOC inference models to predict OOD, and shows how our method enables improvements in generalization performance. 2 Method In this work, we analyze a large library of soil carbon contents and soil reflectances.
