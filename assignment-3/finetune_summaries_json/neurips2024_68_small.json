The focus of this study is taken to be Taiwan, an area very vulnerable to typhoons. By comparing the performance of Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Model (CDDPM) with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SENet), results suggest that the CDDPM performs best in generating accurate and realistic meteorological data. Specifically, CDDPM achieved a PSNR of 32.807, which is approximately 7.9% higher than CNN and 5.5% higher than SENet. Furthermore, CDDPM recorded an RMSE of 0.032, showing a 11.1% improvement over CNN and 8.6% improvement over SENet. A key application of this research can be for imputation purposes in missing meteorological datasets and generate additional high-quality meteorological data using satellite images. It is hoped that the results of this analysis will enable more robust and detailed forecasting, reducing the impact of severe weather events on vulnerable regions. Code accessible at https://github. com/TammyLing/Typhoon-forecasting. 1 Introduction In recent years, the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events have increased due to the impacts of global climate change. In particular, typhoons which are one of the types of tropical cyclones (TCs) get notable attention because of the harm they cause to both the natural environment as well as human societies. Taiwan, one of the major economic hubs and populous regions in the Asia, is particularly significant due to its high vulnerability to typhoons [ 1], making it an excellent focus region for this project.With the rapid development of Machine Learning, the typhoon forecasting can be done by numerous methods. Rita et al. [ 2] pioneered the use of artificial neural networks to analyze satellite image data, which marked the first application of deep learning techniques in typhoon trajectory forecasting. Rüttgers et al. [ 3] were the first to utilise satellite images and a generative adversarial network (GAN) to successfully predict both the center coordinates of typhoons and the future shape of cloud structures around typhoons. Moreover, diffusion models have been used for predicting tropical cyclones [ 4]. DYffusion [ 5] was one of the improved diffusion models that introduced a time-conditional interpolator and a predictor network to make a multi-step probability prediction. Building on these advancements, this project uses Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probability Models (CDDPM) [ 6] to predict multiple ERA5 reanalysis variables simultaneously, Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", NeurIPS 2024using Digital Typhoon (DT) [ 7] images as conditional inputs. CDDPM has been successfully used in remote sensing previously [8–11] The study contributions to the current literature can be summarised as follows: 1.A customised typhoon dataset is created, facilitating the matching of DT and ERA5 reanal- ysis data for any given region, allowing more accurate forecasting models across various regions for the future study. 2.We successfully demonstrate CDDPM to consistently outperform other consistently outper- formed other three models across multiple reanalysis variables with the highest PSNR and SSIM scores and the lowest FID and LPIPS score. 3.As a result we also demonstrate the ability to generate additional high-quality reanalysis data from satellite images, which can be used both for forecasting and to fill in gaps in existing reanalysis datasets. 2 Data 2.1 Datasets •ERA5 [ 12] is the fifth generation ECMWF reanalysis for the global climate from 1940 onwards provided by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).
