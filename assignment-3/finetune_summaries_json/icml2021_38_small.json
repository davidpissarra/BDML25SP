Empirical results suggest that the proposed framework signiﬁcantly outperforms various baselines including the ofﬁcial forecasts from U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). 1. Introduction Our climate system is now changing more rapidly than ever in the past due to increasing human activities. Recent re- ports have suggested that the warming of sea surface due to anthropogenic inﬂuences will likely trigger more intense and destructive hurricanes (Knutson et al., 2021). Hurri- canes are rapidly rotating tropical storm systems with a maximum sustained wind speed of at least 64 knots (119 km/hr). Due to their potentially severe impact, accurate long-range forecasting of the hurricane tracks is essential to provide enough time for emergency management and response teams to issue warnings and organize evacuation efforts. However, long-range hurricane track forecasting is a challenging problem due to the complex, non-linear inter- actions among various factors in our atmospheric system. In recent years, there have been growing interests in apply- 1Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Michigan State University, Michigan, USA.

However, there are several limitations to these approaches. Many of the methods, particularly those based on recurrent neural network (RNN) and its variants, are mostly designed for short-range forecasts (24 hour or less) only. These methods often utilize only historical data, which are insufﬁcient to capture the current and future environmental conditions that affect the hurricane trajectory path. While some recent stud- ies have applied deep learning techniques, such as general- ized adversarial networks (GAN) (R ¨uttgers et al., 2019) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) (Mudigonda et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019), to meteorological data, these models are often trained on coarse-resolution data (e.g., 0:5\u000e\u00020:5\u000e), and thus, their forecast errors can still be relatively large. Extending these methods to longer lead time prediction is also a challenge due to the inherent error propagation prob- lem (Cheng et al., 2006). Finally, previous works are mostly designed for batch learning algorithms, which are not ideal given the non-stationary nature of the domain. To address these issues, we propose a novel online LSTM- based framework for long-range hurricane trajectory fore- casting. Instead of using historical data, the framework utilizes the outputs generated from a multi-model ensemble of dynamical (physical) models to generate its predictions. The advantage of using a multi-model ensemble to generate the forecasts is that the ensemble members would simu- late future state of the atmospheric system based on current environmental conditions. Since not all models generate their forecasts at every time step, this leads to considerable amount of missing values in the ensemble forecast data, a challenge that must be addressed by the deep learning frame- work. The proposed architecture consists of two stages. The ﬁrst stage consists of a set of LSTM based layers called model performance layers to learn the performance of the individual ensemble members. The second stage is the prediction layer, which uses the output from the previous stage to generate the ﬁnal multi-lead time predictions.

Introduction\n\nOur climate system is changing rapidly due to increasing human activities. Recent reports suggest that the warming of the sea surface due to anthropogenic influences will likely trigger more intense and destructive hurricanes (Knutson et al., 2021). Hurricanes are rapidly rotating tropical storm systems with a maximum sustained wind speed of at least 64 knots (119 km/hr). Accurate long-range forecasting of hurricane tracks is essential to provide enough time for emergency management and response teams to issue warnings and organize evacuation efforts. However, long-range hurricane track forecasting is a challenging problem due to the complex, non-linear interactions among various factors in our atmospheric system.\n\nIn recent years, there has been growing interest in applying deep learning methods to hurricane prediction tasks (Lee & Liu, 2000; Moradi Kordmahalleh et al., 2016; Alemany et al., 2019; Cox et al., 2018; Gao et al., 2018). However, there are several limitations to these approaches. Many of the methods, particularly those based on recurrent neural networks (RNN) and its variants, are mostly designed for short-range forecasts (24 hours or less) only. These methods often utilize only historical data, which are insufficient to capture the current and future environmental conditions that affect the hurricane trajectory path.\n\nWhile some recent studies have applied deep learning techniques, such as generalized adversarial networks (GAN) (Rütters et al., 2019) and convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) (Mudigonda et al., 2017; Kim et al., 2019), to meteorological data, these models are often trained on coarse-resolution data (e.g., 0.5° × 0.5°), and thus, their forecast errors can still be relatively large. Extending these methods to longer lead time prediction is also a challenge due to the inherent error propagation problem (Cheng et al., 2006). Finally, previous works are mostly designed for batch learning algorithms, which are not ideal given the non-stationary nature of the domain.\n\nTo address these issues, we propose a novel online LSTM-based framework for long-range hurricane trajectory forecasting. Instead of using historical data, the framework utilizes the outputs generated from a multi-model ensemble of dynamical (physical) models to generate its predictions. The advantage of using a multi-model ensemble to generate the forecasts is that the ensemble members would simulate the future state of the atmospheric system based on current environmental conditions. Since not all models generate their forecasts at every time step, this leads to a considerable amount of missing values in the ensemble forecast data, a challenge that must be addressed by the deep learning framework.\n\nThe proposed architecture consists of two stages. The first stage consists of a set of LSTM-based layers called model performance layers to learn the performance of the individual ensemble members. The second stage is the prediction layer, which uses the output from the previous stage to generate the final multi-lead time predictions. The proposed framework allows us to learn the non-linear relationships among the ensemble member forecasts as well as the temporal autocorrelations of the predictions. It also alleviates the missing value problem using a Temporal Decay Memory (TDM) with a masked softmax function for weighting the ensemble member forecasts.\n\nThe proposed framework can be trained either in a batch or an online learning setting.
