This project aims to automatically identify undocumented 6 oil and gas wells in the province of Alberta, Canada to aid in documentation, 7 estimation of emissions and maintenance of high-emitting wells. 8 1 Problem and Motivation 9 Around the world, millions of abandoned oil and gas wells exist in a kind of limbo, often the creation 10 of companies that are now defunct. Decades later, such wells continue to be a major environmental 11 hazard - by contaminating surrounding ecosystems, the groundwater used by the communities around 12 them and contributing greenhouse gases to the atmosphere equivalent to millions of tons of carbon 13 dioxide every year [12]. 14 The number of abandoned wells continues to grow each year. There are approximately 400,000 15 abandoned wells in Canada alone – with the estimate being ten times higher in the United States [ 12]. 16 While databases exist for the locations of some abandoned wells, the locations of the majority of such 17 wells remains unknown. For example, the number of wells recorded by the Pennsylvania Department 18 of Environmental Protection is only about a tenth of the total number of wells estimated to exist in 19 the state [ 5]. An understanding of their environmental impacts is similarly incomplete, with these 20 undocumented wells described as the most uncertain source of methane emissions in Canada [12]. 21 This project aims to leverage machine learning to (1) identify the existence and locations of previously 22 undocumented oil and gas wells in Alberta, and (2) precisely localize and correct inaccurate locations 23 of known abandoned oil and gas wells. The geospatial information we obtain will aid experts in 24 efforts to monitor, assess, and plug such wells, plugging being the process wherein a well bore is 25 ﬁtted with a cement plug to prevent contamination and further methane leakage. In future work, we 26 aim to automatically monitor and create more precise methane inventories from abandoned oil and 27 gas wells and accelerate the identiﬁcation process of especially high methane-emitting wells. 28 2 Background and Related Work 29 Semantic segmentation is a fundamental and well-established task in computer vision.

In addition, segmentation 33 techniques have been used in geolocalization tasks such as improving localization and mapping on 34 slums and small-scale urban structures [13]. 35 The U-Net [ 8] is a fully convolutional neural network (FCN) with a symmetric encoder-decoder archi- 36 tecture. This particular architecture contains an expanding decoder path to enable precise localization 37 and recovery of object details [ 8,10]. Originally developed for medical image segmentation, the 38 U-Net has been used in a variety of other problems, such as road extraction [ 15] and greenhouse 39 detection [4], thanks to its success at performing image segmentation with minimal training data. 40 However, limited work has been done to semantically identify and localize oil and gas infrastructure 41 wells. To date, such efforts have been purely applied on the detection of active oil and gas wells 42 with large spatial features, including large identiﬁable machinery and infrastructure that span up to 43 kilometers, using low to medium resolution satellite imagery [ 6,9]. Conversely, abandoned oil and 44 gas wells are only a few meters large at most, requiring high resolution satellite imagery for detection. 45 3 Proposed Approach 46 Our machine learning methodology is intended to localize abandoned wells from satellite imagery. 47 Speciﬁcally, we will use U-Net-inspired neural networks, which allow fully convolutional implemen- 48 tations that can rapidly process large areas in parallel [ 8].
