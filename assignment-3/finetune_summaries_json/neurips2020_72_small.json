This study proposes a deep learning framework focused on understanding the impact of different landscape topologies on the ignition of a wildﬁre and the rationale behind these results. Our model achieves an accuracy of above 90% in ﬁre occurrence prediction, detection, and classiﬁcation of risky areas by only exploiting topological pattern information from 17,579 landscapes. This study reveals the strong potential of landscape topology in wildﬁre occurrence prediction and its implications for similar research. The proposed methodology can be applied to multiple ﬁelds/studies to understand and capture the role and impact of different topological features and their interactions. Introduction An open and growing challenge is the increase in wildﬁre occurrences across the globe because of its enormous ecological and social impacts, along with its devastating effects on biodiversity and greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Recent megaﬁres in California, Australia, Greece, Chile, Brazil, and Portugal, among other countries, reveal the need for new approaches to understand them [16]. In the context of Deep Learning (DL) models in this ﬁeld, models trained for ﬁre detection [20], wildﬁre spread prediction [9], and ﬁre susceptibility mapping [23] are some examples found in the literature [11]. The study of ﬁre occurrence or ﬁre risk focuses on measuring the chance that a ﬁre might start. Although some studies have reported that landscape topology affects ﬁre growth [5], no study has reported the effect of landscape topology on ﬁre occurrence. Previous studies have considered risk factors derived from weather, danger indices, physiography, land-cover, or socioeconomic variables [4], which, in general, are one-dimensional numerical or categorical variables. However, we have not found any modeling efforts that try to capture landscape topology as a predictor of ﬁre risk, thus necessitating the present study. In general, capturing topological aspects is more complex than constructing a one-dimensional variable such as temperature, topography, and socioeconomic or landscape composition in an area of interest. However, the spatial conﬁguration of these elements may inﬂuence and modify ﬁre regimes [1]. Land-cover data represent the basic information for landscape analysis at a pixel level of the primary land uses in a geographically delimited territory. This two-dimensional representation of the landscape also captures an intrinsic relationship between adjacency and connectivity of its Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.components, which can be studied to understand landscape phenomena and complex patterns and processes, thanks to the increasing availability of global data at a high and medium spatial resolution. In this paper, we introduce deep ﬁre topology (DFT), a comprehensive framework (available as an open-source software) for landscape topology analysis by training a DL model while focusing on understanding the rationale behind the results, to assess images associated with different response variables in ecological applications. We present an application on the landscape ecology of ﬁre risk to evaluate the land-cover topology as a predictor of the ﬁre occurrence probability. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) model without considering additional information such as population density or weather features, which are generally used as variables [4]. We use a supervised learning approach where land-cover images are labeled as ﬁre or no-ﬁre, representing the presence/absence of an ignition. We also open the DL black box focusing on results interpretability. Methods Data. We tested our approach using data from south-central Chile (see Appendix). It includes eight administrative regions ( 212,000 km2), corresponding to 28% of the country, which accounts for 98.5% of the historical ﬁre occurrence [6]. We used a subset (January 2013 to December 2015) of the public database of wildﬁres provided by the Chilean Forest Service that includes the ignition point for each ﬁre from 0.01 ha of burned area. We used this temporal window because to use the most accurate land-cover map of the country [24]. These land-cover data are in a raster grid that includes ten classes: croplands, native forest, forest plantation, grasslands, shrublands, wetlands, water bodies, impervious surfaces, barren land, and snow/ice. In this study area, the impervious surface is represented mainly by urban and industrial infrastructure. The association of ﬁre point pattern with land-cover was carried out in the Google Earth Engine (GEE). From these areas, we extract a buffered area with a radius of 560 m centered in randomly generated points. Accounting for imbalance, we eliminate landscapes with a low proportion of ﬁre-prone classes, deleting a landscape with more than 30% of its pixels being non-ﬂammable. We associate each 1 km2 landscape with the ﬁre occurrence frequency\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
