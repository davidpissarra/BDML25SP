Recent studies have shown that imagery from the multi-spectral instrument on Sentinel-2 satellites is capable of detecting and estimating large methane emissions. However, most of the current methods rely on temporal relations between a ratio of shortwave- infrared spectra and assume relatively constant ground conditions, and availability of ground information on when there was no methane emission on site. To address such limitations we propose a guided query-based transformer neural network architecture, that will detect and quantify methane emissions without dependence on temporal information. The guided query aspect of our architecture is driven by a Sentinel Enhanced Matched Filter ( SEMF ) approach, also discussed in this paper. Our network uses all 12 spectral channels of Sentinel-2 imagery to estimate ground terrain and detect methane emissions. No dependence on temporal data makes it more robust to changing ground and terrain conditions and more computationally efficient as it reduces the need to process historical time-series imagery to compute a single date emissions analysis. 1 Introduction Methane (CH 4) is estimated to contribute 20% of global warming induced by greenhouse gasses [14] with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) 86 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO 2) in a 20 year period [ 18]. The longstanding greenhouse gas has a mean atmospheric residence of 7.9 years [ 17] and its presence in the atmosphere has been increasing since the industrial revolution [ 1]. The annual growth rate of CH 4plateaued between 1999 and 2006, but started increasing again in 2007 [ 20]. Causes of this variable growth rate are highly debated, attributing the sporadic behavior to the natural gas industry, emission from wetlands, and changes in the methane lifetime [ 19,26,27,25,33]. The increases in atmospheric CH 4have prompted governments to enact regulations and action plans such as the ‘U.S. Methane Emissions Reduction Action Plan’ in 2021 and the ‘Global Methane Pledge Energy Pathway’ in 2022 to curb CH 4emission [ 2,21]. Accurately identifying and tracking the contribution of various sources to the methane budget will be paramount to enforce these regulations. Given the strong potential of satellite-based instruments to deliver high-frequency data on global scales and even remote and hard-to-access regions, recent research has depicted the potentials of Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: Qualitative visualization of SEMF intermediate steps and final estimation. deploying methane emissions analysis on public, global-mapping, multi-spectral instruments like the ESA Sentinel-2 mission [ 34,3,8,22,3]. Most previous Sentinel-2-based methane analysis approaches use similar approaches to the methane column retrieval method in [ 34], building large parts of signal exploitation on an analysis of temporal deviation between times of excessive methane concentrations in the atmosphere and times without, merged with ratios between methane-sensitive and less-methane-sensitive bands. While this method, and variations of it [ 5] have revolutionized capabilities of detecting methane emissions with public satellite data, the strong dependency on time-series analysis of spectral reflectance data expose the approach to risky assumptions on (a) knowing when emissions did not exist and (b) temporal albedo stability of the background - that the albedo of a certain area stays constant over time. In return, these assumptions lead to high amounts of false positives, especially in areas with heterogeneous, temporally deviating land cover [34, 36]. To overcome shortcomings of time-series based methane analytics methods, we propose a deeper exploitation of signals from other non-methane-sensitive spectral bands of Sentinel-2 multi-spectral data. Given both, the recent successes of enhance match filters for methane signal processing [31,6,16,32] and progresses in using Machine Learning models for methane emissions analysis [ 16], we hereby propose a 2-step methodology to generate (1) a novel Sentinel Enhanced Match Filter (SEMF) algorithm and (2) an integration of SEMF into a Transformer-based Convolutional Neural Network architecture [ 4,10] as shown in Figure 2. Using the full spectral response captured by Sentinel-2 instruments, we expect the SEMF to support Signal to Noise separation by classifying confusing and hard-to-detect land cover types, artifacts and temporal deviations, such as water bodies, dark green vegetation, calcite, and white painted roofs which are never considered in current band/channel ratio method. Using these classes, SEMF computes statistical properties for each class separately for the whitening of background pixels. 2 Approach The proposed approach is a transformer [ 35] based neural network architecture with a SEMF guidance. The input to the network is B1-B12 bands from Sentinel-2 Level 1C data [ 23]. The output is a segmentation mask that is used with a radiative transfer model for methane emissions analysis.
