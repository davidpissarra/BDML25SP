(2018) to translate climate information and adaptation techniques from major Western and Asian languages to thousands of low resource languages in the developing world. Studies have shown that access to information can help people assess the magnitude of the climate change challenge, possible options and those feasible within the relevant context Nyahunda & Tirivangasi (2019). I endeavour to demonstrate that if this information was available in a language the locals can understand, it would result in local empowerment and as a result inspire action. Without an automated approach, building evaluation sets on low-resource languages is both expensive and time-consuming because the pool of professional translators is limited, as there are few ﬂuent bilingual speakers for these languages Guzm ´an et al. (2019), Ambati (2012). This solution would be very impactful considering that these languages are spoken by a large fraction of the world population Guzm ´an et al. (2019). Global warming, which occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth’s surface Pappas (2017), is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today Rolnick et al. (2019). It continues to affect natural habitats and biodiversity with disruption on growing season, phenology, primary production, and species distributions and diversity (Bellard et al., 2012). The proposed ML applications will be pivotal to the communities in Northern Kenya that continue to be affected by Climate change Huho (2015) through prolonged droughts that have threatened their livelihoods and as result caused conﬂict van Baalen & Mobj ¨ork (2017) Schilling et al. (2012) since these communities scramble for the increasingly less available natural resources like water and pasture for their animals, by availing climate information in a language locally understood and techniques to adapt to the effects of the phenomenon. The effect is well pronounced by the fact that about a third of the Kenyan population depends on pastoralism for food and income security, KNBS (2010). 2 OBJECTIVES The objectives of the proposal are; 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 \u000fto demonstrate that communities in Northern Kenya contribute to and are affected by Cli- mate change, \u000fto examine the gap that exists in climate information and techniques to adopt to the phe- nomenon due to language barrier and possible impacts to local empowerment \u000fto show that ML techniques can be used to translate information from English to low re- source languages like those used in Northern Kenya \u000fto explore the impact ML applications to bridge this gap would have on the communities 3 L IVESTOCK CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS CLIMATE CHANGE In as much as pastoralism communities in northern Kenya have undergone evolution they largely continue to keep large numbers of livestock as per Kaye-Zwiebel & King (2014) and Hauck & Rubenstein (2017) that contribute towards global warming (Hauck & Rubenstein, 2017). It is esti- mated that the livestock sector contributes 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). The risks of this phenomenon are apparent in agriculture, ﬁsheries and many other components that constitute the livelihood of rural populations in developing countries (Adger & Kelly, 1999). According to Hurst et al. (2005), the livestock sector contributes to the livelihoods of one billion of the poorest population in the world and em- ploys close to 1.1 billion people out of which 1 billion people live in the areas like Northern Kenya (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). 4 G AP IN CLIMATE INFORMATION DUE TO LANGUAGE BARRIER A study by otieno & Pauke (2010) has shown that climate change terminology is poorly understood and does not have standard translations in Swahili, Luo and other local Kenyan languages. This prevents many people from having a voice on the issue or even fully grasping it. Further studies by otieno & Pauke (2010) have shown that African citizens’ response to climate change is hampered by a fundamental shortage of relevant, useful information for African audiences. Additionally, due to low literacy levels as in Duba et al. (2001) and high levels of poverty in these communities, climate information is largely not easily accessible even in its simplest form through TV (Huho, 2015).

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nI aim to demonstrate that making climate information and adaptation techniques available in languages that locals can understand would lead to local empowerment and inspire action. This can be achieved through the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques such as Active Learning (AL) and Transfer Learning (TL) with improvements, as proposed by Liu et al. (2018). Studies have shown that access to information can help people assess the magnitude of the climate change challenge, possible options, and those feasible within the relevant context (Nyahunda & Tirivangasi, 2019). Without an automated approach, building evaluation sets on low-resource languages is both expensive and time-consuming due to the limited pool of professional translators, as there are few fluent bilingual speakers for these languages (Guzmán et al., 2019; Ambati, 2012). This solution would be highly impactful, considering that these languages are spoken by a large fraction of the world's population (Guzmán et al., 2019).\n\nGlobal warming, which occurs when carbon dioxide (CO2) and other air pollutants and greenhouse gases collect in the atmosphere and absorb sunlight and solar radiation that have bounced off the earth's surface (Pappas, 2017), is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today (Rolnick et al., 2019). It continues to affect natural habitats and biodiversity, with disruptions to growing seasons, phenology, primary production, and species distributions and diversity (Bellard et al., 2012).\n\nThe proposed ML applications will be crucial to communities in Northern Kenya, which continue to be affected by climate change through prolonged droughts that have threatened their livelihoods and caused conflict (Huho, 2015; van Baalen & Möörk, 2017; Schilling et al., 2012). These communities struggle to access natural resources like water and pasture for their animals, and making climate information available in a language they understand and techniques to adapt to the effects of the phenomenon would be beneficial.\n\nThe effect is evident, as about a third of the Kenyan population depends on pastoralism for food and income security (KNBS, 2010).\n\nThe objectives of this proposal are:\n\n1. To demonstrate that communities in Northern Kenya contribute to and are affected by climate change.\n2. To examine the gap that exists in climate information and techniques to adapt to the phenomenon due to language barriers and possible impacts on local empowerment.\n3. To show that ML techniques can be used to translate information from English to low-resource languages like those used in Northern Kenya.\n4. To explore the impact of ML applications on bridging this gap and its effects on the communities.\n\nPastoralism communities in Northern Kenya have undergone evolution but continue to keep large numbers of livestock, contributing to global warming (Kaye-Zwiebel & King, 2014; Hauck & Rubenstein, 2017). The livestock sector contributes 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change (Rojas-Downing et al., 2017). The risks of this phenomenon are apparent in agriculture, fisheries, and other components of rural populations' livelihoods in developing countries (Adger & Kelly, 1999).\n\nAccording to Hurst et al.
