Although recent geostationary satellite resolution has improved, the long-term analysis of climate applications is limited to using multiple satellites from the past to the present due to the different res- olutions. To solve this problem, we proposed warp and refine network (WR-Net). WR-Net is divided into an optical flow warp component and a warp image refinement component. We used the TV-L1 algorithm instead of deep learning-based approaches to extract the optical flow warp component. The deep-learning-based model is trained on the human-centric view of the RGB channel and does not work on geostation- ary satellites, which is gray-scale one-channel imagery. The refinement network refines the warped image through a multi- temporal fusion layer. We evaluated WR-Net by interpolation of temporal resolution at 4 min intervals to 2 min intervals in large-scale GK2A geostationary meteorological satellite im- agery. Furthermore, we applied WR-Net to the future frame prediction task and showed that the explicit use of optical flow can help future frame prediction. Introduction Weather prediction using geostationary satellite imagery in- directly contributes to the earth‚Äôs environment in various fields such as planning natural energy resources (Pathak et al. 2022) and extreme weather event prediction. Physically-based numerical weather prediction models have traditionally been used to analyze and forecast weather and climate, but recent developments in deep learning-based models have made data-driven methods possible to use for weather prediction. In the era of the climate crisis, accurate weather prediction is essential to prepare the sudden disas- ters and to maximize the use of renewable energy such as wind and solar power. Therefore, the spatial and temporal resolution of forecasting results is important to appropriate countermeasures. Recently, a geostationary-satellite resolu- tion has been improved with 1-2 minute intervals with a *corresponding author Copyright ¬© 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, to integrate multiple satel- lites from the past to the present for long-term analysis for climate applications, there is a limit to high-resolution anal- ysis because most of the past geostationary satellites have a lower resolution of 10 to 15 minutes. To solve this problem, Vandal and Nemani (Vandal and Nemani 2021) proposed a temporal interpolation of geosta- tionary satellite imagery with optical flow approach based on Super SloMo (Jiang et al. 2018). In the Super SloMo based method, when images ItandIt+1are given, the interpola- tion frame Iiis predicted through optical flow estimation and warp between them. This method achieved state-of-the- art, but does not extract the optical flow properly when a sample that has not been learned in the training phase is in- put and is vulnerable to intensity changes such as brightness changes. To solve this problem, video frame interpolation meth- ods using pre-trained weights for PWC-Net (Sun et al. 2018) and FlowNet (Dosovitskiy et al. 2015) have been proposed. However, PWC-Net and FlowNet trained on RGB channels of human-centric view do not work in geostationary satellite imagery. In this paper, we propose Warp and Refine Network (WR- Net). WR-Net is divided into optical flow estimation and warp component and refinement component. In the optical flow estimation and warp component, since deep learning- based supervised optical flow estimation methods cannot be used, we estimate and warp the optical flow through the to- tal variation-L1 algorithm, a non-parametric approach. Af- ter that, the refinement network refines the intensity change through a multi-temporal fusion of the warp frame with It andIt+1to refine the intensity change, such as the bright- ness change. We verified the WR-Net in large-scale GK2A geostationary meteorological satellite imagery, and as a re- sult achieved state-of-the-art. Furthermore, we extend WR-Net to future frame predic- tion. Our motivation is that optical flow includes information such as movement direction and speed, and this will be ef- fective not only for video frame interpolation but also for fu- ture frame prediction. We predicted the frame after 90 min through WR-Net and evaluated it qualitatively. As a result of qualitative analysis, it was shown that the explicit use of optical flow is helpful for future frame prediction.
