In this paper, we develop an unsupervised learning approach (DeepOPF-NGT) for solving AC-OPF problems, which does not require training datasets with ground truth to operate. Instead, it uses a prop- erly designed loss function to guide the tuning of the neural network parameters to directly learn one load-solution mapping. Preliminary results on the IEEE 30-bus test system show that the un- supervised DeepOPF-NGT approach can achieve comparable optimality, feasibility, and speedup performance against an existing supervised learn- ing approach. 1. Introduction With the development of the economy, electricity consump- tion has been increasing rapidly worldwide, and electricity generation has been one of the primary sources of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. According to the report by EIA (2020), CO2 emissions by the U.S. electric power sector were about 32% of total U.S. energy-related CO2 emissions. The AC optimal power ﬂow (AC-OPF) problem has been 1School of Data Science, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China.

A study by FERC (2013) shows that an efﬁcient AC-OPF solution approach can potentially save tens of billions of dollars every year. With more penetration of renewables, the AC-OPF problem needs to be solved more frequently to maintain the stable and economic operation of power systems. Hence, it is of great interest to solve AC-OPF problems with high efﬁciency. Deep neural network (DNN)-based approach has been pro- posed to solve AC-OPF problems efﬁciently by exploiting the powerful learning ability of DNN. Much of the mod- ern work focuses on supervised learning-based algorithms, which learns the mapping between loads and optimal gen- eration set points based on a given dataset generated by physics-based solvers (e.g., Matpower Interior Point Solver (MIPS)). Existing approaches can be classiﬁed into two main categories: hybrid approach and stand-alone approach. The hybrid approach accelerates conventional solvers by pro- viding warm-start points (Dong et al., 2020) or predicting active (Chen & Zhang, 2020) /inactive constraints (Hasan et al., 2021). The stand-alone approach predicts the solu- tion of the AC-OPF problem directly without solving the optimization problem, which has a greater speedup than the hybrid approach (Pan et al., 2019; 2020a;b; Zamzam & Baker, 2020; Baker, 2020). The main idea is to pre- dict decision variables (i.e., optimal generation set points) and then reconstruct the remaining variables using a power ﬂow solver. Without solving power ﬂow equations, Chat- zos et al. (2020) combine DNNs and Lagrangian duality to predict all variables directly, but the critical power ﬂow balance constraints may not be satisﬁed. To improve both the speedup and feasibility of existing approaches, a DNN- based voltage-constrained approach DeepOPF-V (Huang et al., 2021) is proposed, which predicts all bus voltages and then reconstructs all remaining variables via simple matrix operation. All the above approaches require a large dataset for DNN training, which is computationally expensive, especially for large-scale power systems. More importantly, due to the non-convexity of AC-OPF problems, solvers may provide one of the locally optimal solutions for each load conﬁgura-Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2021 tion, and different initial points may even lead to different solutions (Chiang & Wang, 2018). Consequently, there is no guarantee for the optimality of the generated dataset. Per- haps more critically, the samples in the dataset may belong to different mappings between the load to (sub-)optimal so- lutions, which hinders the learning performance of DNNs.
