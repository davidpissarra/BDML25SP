These techniques have enabled climate change research at previously impossible scales, performing tasks such as the delineation of individual coral reef colonies [Tal- paert Daudon et al., 2023], identification of individual tree crowns [Sun et al., 2022], mapping agricultural fields [Chen et al., 2023a], pollution tracking [Temitope Yekeen et al., 2020], and glacier monitoring [Heidler et al., 2023]. However, environmental scientists often encounter a scarcity of labeled data needed to train instance segmentation models effectively [Sun et al., 2021]. State-of-the-art instance segmentation models such as YOLOv8 are known to require a substantial volume of data for training [TAO et al., 2023], hampering their use in environmental science research. Such models rely on a \"Detect-then-Segment\" strategy which starts by finding objects using bounding boxes and then uses these boxes as a reference to segment each object individually [Chen et al., 2019]. This approach relies on extensive instance mask datasets that require labor-intensive human labeling [Potlapally et al., 2019]. Additionally, the pre-trained versions of such models are typically not optimized for remote sensing data, further increasing the burden of generating large labeled datasets for remote sensing applications [Wang et al., 2023]. We introduce a novel instance segmentation workflow designed to diminish training data requirements. Instead of the conventional Detect-then-Segment workflow, our Segment-then-Classify (STC) method leverages the zero-shot capabilities of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to segment all objects in a remote sensing image [Chen et al., 2023b] before relying on a simple classifier, such as ViT, to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.retain the masks of interest. Pre-trained on a vast dataset of over one billion masks[Kirillov et al., 2023], SAM has shown remarkable generalization capabilities that allow it to adapt to the diverse and dynamic nature of remote sensing data [Osco et al., 2023] without needing additional training. Because image classifiers require comparatively small amounts of data for training as compared to instance segmentation models, STC has the potential to drastically reduce training data requirements and present a more widely accessible instance segmentation workflow for earth observation data. To test the performance of the proposed workflow across different dataset sizes and remotely sensed classes, we use the VHR-10 dataset, composed of satellite images labeled with ten different classes. The ViT classifier, and therefore the STC strategy, reaches convergent performance after a mere 40 examples per class, highlighting the small number of labels required for this workflow to reach its peak performance. By comparison, YOLOv8 requires up to three times the amount of labeled data to achieve comparable performance. Certain classes achieved mAP@0.5 scores of up to 0.99, an impressive near-perfect score given the small amount of data required for training. However, the mAP@0.5 of the worst performing class was a dissatisfactory 0.08, suggesting that the ability to fine-tune the segmentation step would lead to a more universally applicable approach [Mattjie et al., 2023, Ji et al., 2023]. This work represents a new paradigm for instance segmentation that has the potential to drastically reduce the amount of data required for training. By relaxing this reliance on labeled data, STC has the potential to greatly expand the use of instance segmentation in areas such as remote sensing for climate change research, where a lack of labeled data hampers current use. 2 The Segment-then-Classify Workflow The Segment-then-Classify strategy employs two steps (Figure 1). First, SAM’s \"everything\" mode is used to automatically generate instance masks across the remote sensing RGB image. Second, a classifier, for example ViT, filters and labels the instance masks.
