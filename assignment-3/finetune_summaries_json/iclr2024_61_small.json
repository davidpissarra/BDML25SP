To effectively model the convective phenomena driving severe precipitation, high-resolution estimates are crucial. Existing methods struggle with either insufficient expressiveness in cap- turing complex convective dynamics, due to the low resolution, or excessive com- putational demands. In response, we propose an innovative deep learning frame- work that efficiently harnesses available data to yield precise results. This model, based on graph neural networks, utilises two grids with different resolution and two sets of edges to represent spatial relationships. Employing as input ERA5 reanalysis atmospheric variables on an approximately 25km grid, the framework produces hourly precipitation estimates on a finer 3km grid. Findings are promis- ing in accurately capturing yearly precipitation distribution and estimating cu- mulative precipitation during extreme events. Notably, the model demonstrates effectiveness in spatial regions not included in the training, motivating further ex- ploration of its transferability potential. 1 I NTRODUCTION Every year across the world, natural catastrophes cause casualties and significant damage to proper- ties and assets and the trend in weather related extremes is growing, due to climate change (IPCC, 2022). Precipitation-related events (flood, drought, landslides) have a tremendous social and eco- nomical impact and are all projected to increase (Van Aalst, 2006; Banholzer et al., 2014). Disaster risk forecasting highly depends on the ability to correctly quantify the hazard related to the nat- ural phenomenon, which is not straightforward, particularly for precipitation. Mainly two types of precipitation exist: weak and severe. The former is caused by strati-form clouds, uniform and stable, with no complicated airflow motion. The latter is related to convective systems, complex and characterised by non-linear airflow motion. Severe precipitation is crucial when considering extreme events, yet difficult to model. Traditional approaches to estimate precipitation on high- resolution grids include Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) (Cuo et al., 2011), downscaling of low-resolution precipitation projections (CORDEX; EUCP; Laflamme et al., 2016) and Convec- tion Permitting Models (CMPs) (Coppola et al., 2020; Kendon et al., 2021). QPE and downscaling are cost-effective, but struggle in modelling severe precipitation, while CPMs can correctly model convective systems, but high resolution comes at an enormous computational cost. In this setting, models based on Machine Learning (ML) and particularly Deep Learning (DL) may play an impor- tant role bringing both improved accuracy in severe events modelling and significant computational speed-up. DL models have been used to reproduce QPEs results (Wang et al., 2022), to improve downscaling (Reddy et al., 2023; Kumar et al., 2023), and few studies addressed the problem of building emulators for precipitation (Wang et al., 2021; Doury et al., 2023,Addison et al., 2022).
