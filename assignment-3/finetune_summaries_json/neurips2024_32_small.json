This work is a first step towards multi-decadal turbine-location-aware wind power forecasting using global climate model out- put. 1 Introduction To mitigate climate change, wind energy will play an essential role in future power supply Barthelmie and Pryor [2021]. Efficient power planning should therefore account for natural wind variability as well as climate change by incorporating climate projections into multi-decadal fore- casts [e.g. Miao et al., 2023]. However, these climate projections have two main shortcomings: Their output resolutions are coarse due to the high (computational) complexity of climate models and are uncertain as they account for, among other things, uncertain human behavior. To overcome the issue of coarse spatial resolution (usually ≥100km) of general circulation models (GCMs), so-called downscaling techniques have been developed [e.g. Sun et al., 2024]. Using physical or statistical properties or Machine Learning [e.g. Langguth et al., 2024], downscaling can increase that spatial but also the temporal resolution of GCMs. For multi-decadal wind power forecasts, where the goal is an accurate cumulative power prediction, Effenberger et al. [2023] have shown that a temporal resolution of 6 hours is usually high enough. An analogous observation has not been made for spatial resolutions; a high spatial resolution is often beneficial [e.g. Tamoffo et al., 2020]. For CMIP6 [Eyring et al., 2016], the latest version of globally organized GCMs, no high-resolution regional model runs are available. This is in contrast to its predecessor CMIP5 [Jacob et al., 2020]. However, previous research revealed that CMIP6 and CMIP5 show differences regarding future wind resource projections for Europe [Carvalho et al., 2021]; other work unveiled a better capability of CMIP6 in simulating surface wind speeds over the whole Northern hemisphere [Miao et al., 2023]. Additionally, Jung and Schindler [2022] show that the highly unlikely Davy et al. [2018] worst-case climate model scenario SSP585 is over-represented in current research. Hence, there’s a need for realistic scenarios of CMIP6 for multi-decadal power forecasting. Multi-decadal wind power forecasts are difficult to validate. This is a known problem with climate projections as no ground truth is yet available for the future [e.g. Risbey et al., 2021]. Additionally, most of the data in renewable power research is confidential. Therefore, it is common to use wind ∗corresponding author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.speeds Jung and Schindler [2020] or wind speeds cubed Miao et al. [2023] as a proxy for wind power. Some research also considers turbine locations for more realistic power predictions [e.g. Tobin et al., 2016, Jung and Schindler, 2020]. Using CMIP6 data directly, we can account for the latest climate model updates. With Gaussian Processes (GPs) we additionally include turbine locations into our power predictions and show that these are similar to ground truth power generation. Our analysis reveals that taking turbine locations into account in multi-decadal wind power forecasting is even more important than the climate sce- nario. We describe our approach in Section 2, our results in Section 3 and discuss and conclude in Section 4 and Section 5. 2 Methods Our general approach includes 1) estimating wind speeds at turbine locations 2) extrapolating wind speeds to hub-height and 3) predicting the power output. We compare the wind speeds at turbine locations to predictions that do not involve locations and are based on gridded weather or climate datasets. We perform the same steps on these datasets but 1) use the wind speeds at grid points 2) extrapolate wind speeds to the average hub-height and 3) compute the power output using the most common turbine across the dataset. Data For our evaluation, we consider the gridded reanalysis dataset ERA5 [Hersbach et al., 2020] and the gridded climate dataset MPI-ESM1.2-HR [Müller et al., 2018] from CMIP6. Furthermore, we com- pare our predictions generated using these weather and climate datasets to aggregated transmission level power generation.
