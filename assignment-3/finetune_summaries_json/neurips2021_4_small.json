Accurate long-range climate prediction allows more time for preparation and disaster risk management for such extreme events. Although machine learning approaches have shown promising results in long-range climate forecasting, the associated model uncertainties may reduce their reliability. To address this issue, we propose a late fusion approach that systematically combines the predictions from multiple models to reduce the expected errors of the fused results. We also propose a network architecture with the novel denormalization layer to gain the beneÔ¨Åts of data normalization without actually normalizing the data. The experimental results on long-range 2m temperature forecasting show that the framework outperforms the 30-year climate normals, and the accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of models. 1 Introduction Global warming leads to the increase in frequency and intensity of climate extremes [ 7]. High-impact extreme events such as heat waves, cold fronts, Ô¨Çoods, droughts, and tropical cyclones can result in tremendous loss of lives and property, and accurate predictions of such events beneÔ¨Åt multiple sectors including water, energy, health, agriculture, and disaster risk reduction [ 9]. The longer the range of an accurate prediction, the more the time for proper preparation and response. Therefore, accurate long-range forecasting of the key climate variables such as precipitation and temperature is valuable. Numerical models for weather and climate prediction have a long history of producing the most accurate seasonal and multi-annual climate forecasts, but they come with the cost of large and expensive physics-based simulations (e.g. [ 6,1]). With the recent advancements in machine learning such as deep learning, the use of machine learning for climate forecasting has become more popular [3,14,12,11], and some machine learning approaches can outperform numerical models in certain tasks [ 3]. Nevertheless, depending on the machine learning algorithm and data availability, different degrees of model uncertainties exist. In deep learning, models trained with the same data and hyperparameters are usually not identical. This is caused by the random processes in training such as weight initialization and data shufÔ¨Çing. Such model uncertainties can be more prominent for climate forecasting given the limited data, and this can reduce the reliability of the models especially with large lead times. Even though reducing the randomness in training (e.g., using Ô¨Åxed weight initialization) may reduce the model uncertainties, the chance of getting better models is also reduced. \u0003Corresponding author ( clwong@us.ibm.com ) Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.BN Block(20) Block(20)Global  average  poolingFC ‚Ä¶Multi -channel input Multi -channel  output √ó6 ùëõ‚Äìfeature growth rate (No average pooling in the last block)Conv (4√ó8) + BN + SELU Average pooling (2 √ó2)ùëõBlock(ùëõ)Denormalization Figure 1: Network architecture for 2m temperature forecasting.

In this paper, our goal is to reduce model uncertainties and improve accuracy in seasonal climate forecasting. By modifying the late fusion approach in [ 13] to adapt to deep learning regression, predictions from different models trained with identical hyperparameters are systematically combined to reduce the expected errors in the fused results. We demonstrate its applicability on long-range 2m temperature forecasting.

Given a multi-channel input tensor formed by stacking the input maps of 2m temperature spanning a Ô¨Åxed input horizon, the network predicts the 2m temperatures at multiple locations with a Ô¨Åxed lead time.

Given a multi-channel input tensor formed by stacking the input maps of 2m temperature spanning a fixed input horizon, the network predicts the 2m temperatures at multiple locations with a fixed lead time. The network comprises six dense blocks, each with a convolutional layer and a growth rate of 20. A batch normalization layer is used right after the input layer for data normalization. However, normalizing the predictands allows the use of simpler architectures with better accuracy, but the resulting model can only provide normalized predictions, requiring post-processing to recover the original values.\n\nTo address this issue, we introduce a denormalization layer after the final fully connected layer to obtain:\n\nxo(c) = xi(c) + œÉ(c) * (xÃÑ(c) - Œº(c))\n\nwhere c is the channel index, and xo, xi, œÉ, and Œº are the output, input, standard deviation, and mean value, respectively, computed from the training data. Using this denormalization layer, the final fully connected layer only needs to predict normalized values, thus removing the need for predictand normalization.\n\n2.2 Late Fusion\n\nWe modified the late fusion approach in [13] to adapt to deep learning regression, combining predictions from different models trained with identical hyperparameters to reduce the expected errors in the fused results.
