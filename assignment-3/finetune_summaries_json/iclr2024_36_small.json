End-to-End Learning of the Inverse  Sentinel-2 data to use.  Species and temporal information  will be used to verify retrieved variables’ plausibility.

Results  AE_RTM_corr achieves over ten times lower  MSE than the baseline NNRegressor.  Superior reconstruction accuracy for AE_RTM_corr, illustrated by spectral band.  Baseline application to real spectra yields implausible distributions of variables, while  AE_RTM_corr learns  plausible and distinguishable distributions across forest types.  Pairwise co-distributions of variables shows that AE_RTM_corr can learn distinct  physical patterns. Red: coniferous forest. Blue: deciduous forest.  Our model effectively captures distinct, temporally smooth and plausible  variations  of inferred physical parameters for different forest types.   Pairwise Jeffreys-Matusita (JM) distance between species based on the learned  variables.  Our model can learn more disentangled variables  within the latent space. Bias correction. Significantly improved reconstruction loss.  Biophysical variables. More plausible recovery.
