With strict emissions reduction targets in place, the industry is turning to machine learning-based decision support models to achieve sustainability goals. This proposal explores the transformative potential of digitalization and machine learning approaches in maritime operations, from optimizing ship speeds to enhanc- ing supply chain management. By examining various machine learning techniques, this work provides a roadmap for reducing emissions while improving operational efficiency in the maritime sector. 1 Introduction The maritime industry, long hailed as a vital artery of global trade and commerce, faces a pressing challenge on an unprecedented scale: the urgent need to decarbonize. The escalating rate of energy consumption and its consequential greenhouse gas emissions have compelled regulatory bodies, such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), to institute stringent rules mandating a substantial reduction in emissions [1], [2]. Despite being one of the most carbon-efficient modes of transportation, it contributed 2.02% of global CO2 emissions in 2018. To confront this paradox, the industry is turning to data-driven decision support models. In an era where data and computing capacities are reaching unprecedented levels, the maritime sector is ready to leverage artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and big data analytics to revolutionize its operations. Under the banner of Maritime 4.0, digitalization, automation, and optimization are reshaping maritime logistics [3]. This transformation extends beyond efficiency, encompassing critical areas such as supply chain management, emissions tracking, and port operations enhancement [4]. This proposal explores the intersection of data science and maritime logistics, highlighting the pivotal role of data-driven models in mitigating the industry’s carbon footprint. By examining various data-driven approaches, from AI-aided navigation to statistical analysis for efficiency improvements, the transformative potential of these technologies is unveiled [5], [6].

We are particularly interested in the ML aspect of AI within the maritime context. ML-based estimators for fuel consumption: ML takes center stage in estimating fuel consumption. ML-based estimators, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), employ diverse operating conditions to optimize vessel energy efficiency, facilitating greener maritime operations [6]. ML for ship performance prediction: Predictive capabilities become paramount with statistical models and ML techniques, such as Ridge Regression (RR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and ANN. These models delve into ship performance prediction, including fuel consumption forecasting.
