Towards this, one can make the smart grid learn human behavior intelligibly and use it to implement informed decisions about shifting the peak en- ergy consumption over time via a demand response program. There are many ways in which a distributing company (DC) can implement a demand response program. The popular one being introducing dynamic pricing by DC based on the supply shortage. The anticipation is that the consumers will shift their electricity loads to lower-priced – non-peaked hours whenever possible, thus reducing the peak demand. This paper considers a demand response program where a DC asks the consumers to voluntarily optimize their elec- tricity consumption by offering certain incentives. To give these incentives, DC desires to select an optimal subset of consumers along with an allocation vector depicting the number of electricity unit reduction it is going to ask the selected consumers. This allocation vector also depends on the shortage of electricity DC faces. Every consumer has a certain value associated with every unit (KWh) of electricity at that time and expects a compensation equiv- alent to this valuation for reducing the load. Additionally, each consumer has a limit to the amount of electricity it can reduce. Due to external stochastic factors such as cli- mate change, uncertainty in renewable energy resources at consumers’ end, or a sudden increase in workload, there is a certain probability with which the consumer can reduce the electricity. We refer to such probability as compliance probability (CP). The DC’s goal is thus to minimize (i) the expected loss, which is a function of the cost of buying the electricity from the market, which in turn depends upon CPs, and (ii) the cost incurred for compensating the consumers via the demand-response program. By exploiting the het- erogeneity in the consumer base, multiple units reduction provides more ﬂexibility to the DC and ensures cost effec- tive allocation. In this work, we introduce a novel transformation of the problem to the bounded min knapsack framework for de- mand response, MinKPDR and show its equivalence up to an additional problem dependent constant factor. Bounded min-knapsack problem is a well studied problem in theo- retical computer science and there exists 2\u0000approximate algorithms to solve the problem.

When CPs of the consumers are not known, they can be learnt using combinatorial multi-armed bandits (CMAB) algorithm by selecting different subsets of consumers at dif- ferent rounds (Jain et al., 2014; Li et al., 2018). The existing combinatorial MAB (CMAB) literature (Chen et al., 2016) heavily rely on two assumptions: (i) The reward function is monotone in terms of the stochastic rewards (compliance probabilities in our case), and (ii) The optimal set is ﬁxed over a period of time.

A novel bounded integer min-knapsack algorithm is introduced, which optimizes the loss to the distributor company within a factor of two (multiplicative) and a problem-dependent additive constant, even when allowing for multiple unit reductions. Existing combinatorial multi-armed bandit (CMAB) algorithms fail to work in this setting due to the non-monotonicity of the reward function and time-varying optimal sets.\n\nA novel algorithm, Twin-MinKPDR-CB, is proposed to learn the compliance probabilities efficiently. Twin-MinKPDR-CB works for non-monotone reward functions, bounded min-knapsack constraints, and time-varying optimal sets. It achieves a sub-linear regret of O(logT), where T is the number of rounds the demand response program is run.\n\nThe residential and industrial sector consumes more than 40% of the global electricity produced.
