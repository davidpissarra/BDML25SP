We validated the effectiveness of CLEAR using a dataset representing Irish building stocks. Our experiments uncovered evidence of inconsistent BER assessments, highlighting measurement data corruption within this real-world dataset. 1 I NTRODUCTION The building sector is responsible for nearly 40% of energy-related CO2 emissions (Dahlstr ¨om et al., 2022). Improving building energy efficiency, especially for existing ones, is key to combating cli- mate change for many countries (Egan et al., 2023). Building energy efficiency assessment plays a pivotal role in guiding decisions for both retrofitting existing buildings and designing new ones (Coyne & Denny, 2021; Energy & Engineers). The assessment results stand as cornerstone metrics in shaping various policies for guiding the public to address energy poverty and steer climate action. For example, in Europe, buildings’ energy efficiency is factored into mortgage interests rates for the homeowners (Billio et al., 2022). New dwellings in many EU countries are also required to comply with strict energy efficiency regulations (Energy & Engineers). Despite its significance, the assess- ment process of building energy efficiency in which professionals involved is susceptible to missing values and faulty measurements as the result of negligent errors (Ali et al., 2020). Consequently, such processes are prone to partial data corruption, leading to potential substantial inaccuracies in the assigned energy ratings. Ensuring the reliability and transparency of the Building Energy Rating (BER) process is crucial for upholding the integrity of energy efficiency assessments. To tackle this challenge, previous research on Ireland’s BER data has emphasized the potential benefits of integrating data-driven approaches (Ali et al., 2020). While such approach is promising, the machine learning models examined in (Ali et al., 2020) exhibited a significant performance drop when predicting fine-grained rating level categories. Table 1 presents such performance drops observed in both the Random Forest model and the MLP (multi-layer perceptron) deep learning model. Various factors could potentially contribute to these performance drops, including models’ limited generalizability, sparsity of data distribution, or poor data quality. Currently, there is still a lack of understanding of the actual reasons behind such observations, which, in turn, hamper the potential of data-driven approaches to facilitate the BER assessment process. This study aims to investigate such observations using self-supervised deep learning approaches. Specifically, we propose CLEAR, a self-supervised learning approach that employs Contrastive 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 BER Levels Performance Measure Random Forest MLP A1, A2,..., E1, E2, F, GAccuracy (%) 62.8 69.5 Macro F1 (%) 63.1 63.9 A, B, C, D, EFGAccuracy (%) 76.1 88.6 Macro F1 (%) 75.8 88.9 Table 1: Performance Comparison of Models for BER Prediction with Different Level Granularity (a) Five BER Levels  (b) Fifteen BER Levels Figure 1: 2D PCA Representations in the Latent Spaces of Scarf Models Learning for Energy Assessment Rating evaluation, aiming to provide explainability and improve the reliability of assessment data.

By revealing these inconsistencies in building energy assessments, we identified significant faulty values in the building features. Consequently, such data corruption may largely limit the potential of data-driven approaches for BER assessment.
