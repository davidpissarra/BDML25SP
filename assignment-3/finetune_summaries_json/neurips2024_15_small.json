We also use our dataset to evaluate and estimate the water consumption of inference on two large language models (i.e., Llama-3-70B and GPT-4) in 11 selected African countries. Our findings show that writing a 10-page report using Llama-3-70B could consume about 0.7 liters of water, while the water consumption by GPT-4 for the same task may go up to about 60 liters. For writing a medium-length email of 120-200 words, Llama-3-70B and GPT-4 could consume about 0.13 liters and 3 liters of water, respectively. Interestingly, given the same AI model, 8 out of the 11 selected African countries consume less water than the global average, mainly because of lower water intensities for electricity generation. However, water consumption can be substantially higher in some African countries with a steppe climate than the U.S. and global averages, prompting more attention when deploying AI computing in these countries. Our dataset is publicly available on Hugging Face. 1 Introduction With the rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) and digital services, the demand for data centers has increased substantially [1]. While data center infrastructure was historically lacking in Africa, the continent’s burgeoning digital economy has recently led to a surge in data center constructions, with a projected market growth of 50% by 2026 compared to 2021 [2]. Nonetheless, data centers are notorious for their massive energy usage and water consumption, which have raised significant concerns even in developed countries such as the U.S. [3 –5]. More critically, the added pressure on local water resources is particularly acute in Africa, where many countries are already grappling with extended droughts and water scarcity challenges [6, 7]. Therefore, it is important to assess data centers’ water consumption in Africa, supporting healthy development of the data center industry for essential economic growth while ensuring responsible utilization of limited freshwater resources. Unfortunately, while recent studies have begun to address the growing water consumption of data centers and AI computing [5, 8 –10], they have predominantly focused on regions with large data Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.center concentrations, such as the U.S. and Europe, while leaving out Africa—despite its rapid expansion of data centers and pressing challenges of water scarcity. In this paper, we address the critical gap in the literature and present a first-of-its-kind water ef- ficiency dataset for data centers in 41 African countries across five distinct climate regions. The dataset includes hourly estimates of water usage efficiency (WUE) for both direct and indirect water consumption over one year. We obtain these estimates by combining weather data from across Africa with the corresponding fuel mix data (i.e., the composition of energy sources in each country). To demonstrate the utility of this dataset, we consider two recent large language models (LLMs), i.e., Llama-3-70B and GPT-4, and compare their water consumption for inference in African countries with that in the U.S. and globally. Our results for 11 representative African countries show that writing a 10-page report using Llama-3-70B could consume around 0.7 liters of water while the water consumption by GPT-4 for the same task may go up to nearly 60 liters of water. Interestingly, our results also suggest that 8 out of the 11 selected African countries (including South Africa and Egypt) have a lower water consumption than the global average for performing the same task. This is due in part to a less water-intensive fuel mix for electricity generation in these countries. Additionally, some countries such as Morocco are even less water-consuming than the U.S. Nonetheless, the actual impacts of running AI model inferences on local water resources in these countries are still significant in light of the high water stress levels in African countries. On the other hand, for the same task, some countries such as Namibia are more water-consuming than the global average. Further compounded by the enduring regional water stress, the higher water consumption may prompt more attention when deploying AI services in these countries. 2 Background and Methodology Our dataset is primarily based on the methodology and modeling of [5, 8], which study WUE and AI model water consumption with a heavy emphasis on the U.S. data centers. Like [8], we do not model supply chain manufacturing because this aspect often relies on generalized, less accurate data that may not reflect the unique operational practices of individual data centers or computing workloads. The methodology in [8] provides equations for modeling onsite WUE, which refers to water directly consumed/evaporated to cool down the facility for each unit of server energy consumption, and offsite WUE, which is also called the electric water intensity factor and refers to indirect water consumption by the generation of electricity that supplies each unit of data center energy. Note that water consumption is defined as “water withdrawal minus water discharge”, i\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
