High-resolution climate models could provide a solution, but they are computationally expensive and require finetuning for some model parameters. An alternative method, pioneering in geophysics, is single-image super resolution (SR) applied on lower-resolution model output. However, often input and output of such SR models are available on the same, fixed spatial domain. High-resolution model simulations over Antarctica are available only in some regions.

The stability of ice shelves, the floating margins of the AIS, is compromised by increased surface melt caused by (local) atmospheric warming ( 1;2;3). On the AIS, in-situ observations are very scarce, making calibrated regional climate models (RCMs) the backbone for estimating climatological parameters. The current spatial resolution of leading RCM simulations is coarse for the entire AIS, typically ∼25 km (e.g., Regional Atmospheric Climate Model, RACMO2( 4); Modèle Atmosphérique Régional, MAR ( 5)). It hence poses a challenge for studying surface melt features beyond the grid scale, where higher-resolution observations and/or simulations are required. To date, some higher-resolution ( ∼5 km) simulations have been developed, but they are only over some Antarctic regions (e.g., ( 6)) during a certain time period. It is because generating such high-resolution RCM simulations requires substantial computational resources, and very careful finetuning for some model parameters. In this context, a fast, affordable, and accurate method of producing surface melt in a high spatiotemporal resolution over AIS is needed, to enhance our understanding of the Antarctic surface melt dynamics. As an alternative to running RCMs at a high spatial resolution, image super resolution (SR) ( 7) is a competent computer vision technique to downscale the low-resolution RCM simulations. With the development of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dong et al. (2016) ( 8) proposed SRCNN, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.which is a pioneer study applying deep learning to SR tasks. Presently, the dominant SR models are still mostly CNN-based, e.g., SRResNet ( 9), and HAN ( 10). SRResNet can be combined with a discriminator to build conditional GANs, like SRGAN ( 9) or ESRGAN ( 11). In parallel, there has been a recent development to use transformers ( 12) in SR. Transformers are the state-of-the-art method in natural language processing, and show promising application in computer vision tasks, like the Swin Transformer ( 13;14), including SR. In the field of geoscience, deep-learning-based SR techniques have already been applied for downscaling precipitation ( 15;16), temperature ( 17;18), wind ( 19), Antarctic bed topography ( 20), and satellite remote sensing images ( 21). Among these studies, a sole generator, particularly SRResNet, is prevalently applied. Meanwhile, some studies also applied conditional GANs (e.g., (19; 20)). For this study, we downscaled RACMO2 surface melt from 27 km to 5.5 km over the entire AIS using a proposed SRResNet-backboned and physics-aware network. It takes advantage that both 27 km to 5.5 km resolution surface melt simulations exist over the Antarctic Peninsula based on RACMO2, as the training input pairs. The proposed SR model uses the SRResNet ( 9) as the backbone, while fed by the high-resolution albedo and high-resolution elevation at the end of its upsampling part. The latter part is physics-aware because surface melt is known to be strongly related causally by albedo and elevation (by means of a solid physical relation between air temperature and elevation). Our model shows good performance over the Antarctic Peninsula, and we demonstrate that the estimate of surface melt estimates has significantly improved over all of Antarctica, compared to the sole SRResNet. 2 Methods and materials Figure 1: Overview of the proposed physics-aware SRResNet architecture. 2.1 Data sets The Regional Atmospheric Climate Model version 2.3p2 ( 4), RACMO2, is a leading regional climate model adapted for the simulation of the weather over snow and ice surfaces, for a more accurate representation of\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
