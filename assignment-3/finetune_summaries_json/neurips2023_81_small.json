While ESMs are sophisticated and invaluable, machine learning-based emulators trained on existing simulation data can project additional climate scenarios much faster and are computationally efficient. However, they often lack generalizability and interpretability. This work delves into the potential of causal representation learning, specifically the Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD) method, which could render climate model emulation efficient andinterpretable. We evaluate CDSD on multiple climate datasets, focusing on emissions, temperature, and precipitation. Our findings shed light on the challenges, limitations, and promise of using CDSD as a stepping stone towards more interpretable and robust climate model emulation. 1 Introduction Climate models are indispensable for simulating future climate scenarios based on Shared Socioe- conomic Pathways (SSP) emissions. Earth system models (ESMs) are complex models grounded in systems of differential equations that capture a vast array of physical processes. They provide a comprehensive understanding of climate dynamics, but are computationally expensive, as even a single ESM run for one SSP requires about a year to run on a supercomputer ( 3). Recent advancements in data-driven models using machine learning (ML) present an opportunity to emulate climate projections more efficiently ( 14;27). However, these climate model emulators often act as “black boxes”, lacking interpretability crucial for climate science. Causal methods enable the discovery and quantification of causal dependencies in observed data (22;16), and have emerged as a valuable tool to improve our understanding of physical systems across various fields, including Earth Sciences (see ( 20)). In regards to climate modeling, causal methods can potentially bridge the gap between well defined, but compute-intensive ESMs and efficient, but “black-box” ML models. They could be used for A) causal evaluation of climate model emulators, by identifying causal dependencies within their projections and verifying that they correspond to known physical processes; B) climate emulation, by inferring causally-informed high-level representations underlying climate projections ; and C) causal hypothesis testing and attribution of climate change or extreme events. In particular for climate model emulation and the evaluation of those emulators, causal methods have not been used yet. In the following work, we would like to investigate the potential of causal methods in the context of climate model emulators. Previous work has leveraged causal methods in various forms to increase our understanding of climate data. The necessary foundation for quantifying causality from time-series, was laid by Granger Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.causality ( 8). It was used to infer causal links between CO 2concentration and global temperature (25) and was later extended to deduce causal feedbacks in climate models ( 26). Building on this, approaches like PCMCI and PCMCI+ ( 19;17;21;18) were developed to autonomously discover the causal graphs of observed systems, finding applications in climate science ( 15). More recent work such as Varimax-PCMCI ( 24) combines PCMCI with dimensionality reduction methods to derive causally-informed representations from observable climate data. However, since these methods do not scale well and become computationally inefficient for large and non-linear climate datasets, ( 2) introduced a differentiable causal discovery method called Causal Discovery with Single-parent Decoding (CDSD). CDSD uniquely learns both the latent representation from time-series and the causal graph over these latents simultaneously. Here, we are leveraging CDSD to uncover low-dimensional latent drivers that encapsulate temporal processes in climate model data. Our primary objective is to harness the power of causal methods to make ML-based climate emulation more interpretable and trusted by experts. As a first step, we apply temporal causal representation learning, in the form of CDSD, to learn causally informed low-dimensional latents underlying the emissions, temperature, and precipitation time-series from ClimateSet ( 11). We show that CDSD is able to infer representations that match known physical processes, demonstrating that CDSD can be used to evaluate and validate climate models. We believe that our findings and proposed solutions pave the way for further development of causally informed climate model emulation techniques. 2 Causal Discovery with Single-Parent Decoding CDSD considers a generative model where dx-dimensional variables {xt}T t=1are observed across T time steps. These observations, xt, are influenced by dz-dimensional latent variables zt. For instance, xtcould represent climate measurements, while ztmight represent unknown regional climate trends. The model considers a stationary time series of order τover these latent variables. Binary matrices\b Gk\tτ k=1represent the causal relationships between latents at different time steps.
