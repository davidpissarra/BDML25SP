Therefore, we propose an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) model trained on 7 million global satel- lite wildfire observations. Validation results suggest substan- tial potential for high resolution, enhanced accuracy projec- tions of global wildfire risk, and the model outperforms the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research’s leading fire model. Applied to a collection of 190 global forest carbon projects, we find that fire exposure is projected to increase 55% [37-76%] by 2080 under a mid-range scenario (SSP2- 4.5). Our results indicate the large wildfire carbon project damages seen in the past decade are likely to become more frequent as forests become hotter and drier. In response, we hope the model can support wildfire managers, policymakers, and carbon market analysts to preemptively quantify and mit- igate long-term permanence risks to forest carbon projects. 1 Introduction The United Nations considers carbon offsets and associated carbon credits a critical tool to speed up climate action [1]. One of the main types of offset programs is forest carbon offsets, which involve activities such as reforestation, avoid- ance of deforestation, and improved forest management. In exchange for these actions, forest projects are awarded car- bon credits, which can be sold on carbon markets to indi- viduals, businesses, and governments wishing to support the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Such market-based mechanisms are designed to incentivize climate action and reduce costs, with one estimate that carbon offset markets can reduce the cost of implementing countries’ current re- duction commitments by more than half ($250 billion) by 2030 [2]. Along with the growth in carbon markets is the recog- nition that carbon offset credits need to be externally vali- dated to determine whether they are credible and will de- liver the climate benefits they promise. Central to carbon ICLR 2023 Workshop: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Figure 1: Out-of-sample application of our wildfire model to a forest carbon project (ACR255) in Washington state. A wildfire burned 11% of the project in 2021 as determined by satellite observations (top left). The 2021 predicted proba- bility (top right) incorporates a range of geospatial features, including land cover (bottom left). Future predictions from our model (bottom right) for this offset project indicate sub- stantial increases in wildfire risks across three candidate cli- mate scenarios (Methods). Project boundaries coarsened for visualization. credits is the idea of permanence, or the long-term stabil- ity of emissions reductions claimed by a project, a period of several decades and up to 100 years. This means that the carbon sequestration or emissions reductions associated with the credit must not be reversed in the future, for exam- ple by illegal deforestation or natural disturbances. Concern over unverified carbon credits and projects delivering off- sets lower than reported has led to claims of ‘greenwashing’. Such credibility doubts can affect individuals and corpora- tions alike. For example, as companies seek to enact their Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, they want to ensure carbon credits purchased to improve their ESG scores are trustworthy. Climate change, through its impacts on wildfire, poses a growing threat to forest carbon projects, jeopardizing theirlong-term ability to reduce carbon emissions. Wildfires are a present danger to offset projects because they immedi- ately release aboveground carbon to the atmosphere and can likewise increase soil carbon losses [3]. Unfortunately, re- cent work suggests current wildfire risk to carbon credits is severely underestimated. A 2022 audit estimated that nearly all of the carbon credits set aside by California’s cap and trade program were exhausted by recent wildfires, a buffer pool intended to last 100 years [4]. Compounding the effects of wildfires, increased drought stress in response to climate change can limit the ability of forests to sequester carbon and make them more vulnera- ble to wildfires [5]. Drought-stressed forests may also be more susceptible to insect infestation, and the range of inva- sive species is increasing as climates shift [6]. For instance, the bark beetle has killed nearly 5% of western U.S. forests since 1997, and they are expected to continue to spread because of climate change [6]. Combined, the interplay of increasing wildfire risk, drought severity, and insect stress in response to climate change can create positive feedback mechanisms that amplify carbon reversal risk in forest car- bon projects [7]. Recent advances in AI can help us better quantify future wildfire risk and the expected long-term impacts on forest carbon projects. Super-resolution neural networks have been built to increase the spatial resolution of fire models, with the AI-enhanced projections used by multiple commercial and nonprofit stakeholders [8].
