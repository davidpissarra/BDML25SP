Traditionally, ENSO forecasts have been produced using either computationally intensive physics-based dynamical models or statistical models that make limiting assumptions, such as linearity between predictors and predictands. Here we present a deep-learning-based methodology for forecasting monthly ENSO temperatures at various lead times. While traditional statistical methods both train and validate on observational data, our method trains exclusively on physical simulations. With the entire observational record as an out-of-sample validation set, the method’s skill is comparable to that of operational dynamical models. The method is also used to identify disagreements among climate models about the predictability of ENSO in a world with climate change. 1 Introduction The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a cycle of warm and cold temperatures in the equa- torial Paciﬁc Ocean that inﬂuences weather patterns around the world. It impacts North American temperature and precipitation, (Ropelewski and Halpert) the Indian Monsoon (Kumar, Rajagopalan, and Cane), and hurricanes in the Atlantic (Pielke Jr and Landsea). Thus, it has consequences for agricultural planning, commodity prices, insurance terms, and energy availability (Yu et al. Anderson et al. Aryal et al.). Traditionally, the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) runs a physics- based seasonal forecasting model called SEAS5. With supercomputers, they forecast the Niño- 3.4 index, an area in the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean averaged from 5N–5S and 120–170W (Bamston, Chelliah, and Goldenberg). Existing machine learning ENSO forecasts have utilized long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks (Broni-Bediako et al.) or a combination of autoregressive integrated moving average models and artiﬁcial neural networks (Nooteboom et al.). While these forecasts are trained exclusively on observations, we train a neural network only on simulations from Coupled Atmosphere–Ocean General Circulation Models (AOGCMs) and evaluate it on observations.

AOGCMs are numerical simulations of atmospheric and ocean processes used to improve understand- ing of the climate system and its temporal behavior. The scientiﬁc community has created historical, present, and future simulations of the behavior of the climate under different scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions. By training neural networks on AOGCMs, we present three contributions: 1.Trained only on physical simulations, neural networks offer comparable performance to operational seasonal forecasting models. 2.To evaluate the interpretability of neural networks, we compare their saliency maps to global grids showing the R2value between each grid cell and the subsequent Niño-3.4 index. 3.We investigate the predictability of ENSO in a world with climate change and a world without climate change. 2 Forecasting El Niño with Deep Learning 2.1 Methodology We train a neural network that takes as input a 24-month time series of monthly surface temperature on a global 192 x 96 grid, and it forecasts the Niño-3.4 index at a speciﬁed lead time. Our neural network is a convolutional and recurrent architecture: it encodes the spatial information of each global surface temperature grid using a 6-layer convolutional neural network, and then feeds the encoded information into an LSTM to learn from the temporal sequence. (See Appendix 5.1 for a detailed description of the architecture.) Based on their accuracy in simulating ENSO (V oldoire et al.), we trained our neural network on the following AOGCMs (named after the modeling centers that produced them): CNRM-CM5 (800 years), MPI-ESM-LR (1000 years), NorESM1-M (500 years), HadGEM2-ES (500 years) and GFDL-ESM2G (500 years). To develop a set of ground truth Niño-3.4 targets, we calculate the Niño-3.4 indices reported in ERA5 (Hersbach), a gridded dataset of historical observations. Due to SEAS5 data availability, we use the years 1993-2016 as our validation set. 2.2 Results (a)  (b) Figure 1: (1a) Correlation of ClimateAi method, Ham et. al. method,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
