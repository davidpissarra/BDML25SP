Even though AI-driven digital agriculture can offer high-performing predictive functionalities, it lacks tangible quantitative evidence on its benefits to the farmers. Field experiments can derive such evidence, but are often costly and time consuming. To this end, we propose an observational causal inference framework for the empirical evaluation of the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators. This way, we can increase farmers’ trust by enhancing the transparency of the digital agriculture market, and in turn accelerate the adoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a sustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate. As a case study, we perform an empirical evaluation of a recommendation system for optimal cotton sowing, which was used by a farmers’ cooperative during the growing season of 2021. We leverage agricultural knowledge to develop a causal graph of the farm system, we use the back-door criterion to identify the impact of recommendations on the yield and subsequently estimate it using several methods on observational data. The results show that a field sown according to our recommendations enjoyed a significant increase in yield ( 12% to17%). 1 Introduction The increasing global population and the changing climate are putting pressure on the agricultural sector, demanding the sustainable production of adequate quantities of nutritious food, feed and fiber. In this context, we need climate-smart agriculture [ 37,22] to optimize crop management with zero waste, enhance resilience, increase production and reduce emissions [ 41]. Unfortunately, the agricultural sector experiences limited adoption of pertinent smart farming technologies [ 26] that could drive the required sustainable production. This might seem odd at first sight, given the recent surge of sophisticated digital tools that utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big Earth data [ 53]; yet farmers are skeptical about their effectiveness as most lack quantitative evidence on their benefits [39,36]. Traditionally, quantifying the impact of a service would require the design and execution of a randomized experiment [ 9]. Nevertheless, field experiments for the evaluation of digital agriculture tools are seldom done since they are inflexible, requiring follow-up experiments for any changes in the product, but also costly and time-consuming [ 57]. Thus, an observational causal inference ∗Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.framework [ 46] can fill this gap by emulating the experiment we would have liked to run [ 30]. Causal inference with observational data has been the subject of recent work across diverse disciplines, including ecology [ 3], public policy [ 23,24], and Earth sciences [ 42,47,50]. In agriculture, it has been used to identify and estimate the effect of agricultural practices on various agro-environmental metrics [ 48,18,27]. According to Adelman (1992), the comprehensive evaluation of decision support systems has three facets: i) the subjective, ii) the technical and iii) the empirical evaluation [ 1]. While subjective and technical evaluation have been sufficiently practiced [ 61,51], the empirical evaluation methods, and in particular with regards to the impact assessment of digital agriculture tools, have been seldom employed. Thus, we propose a framework for the empirical evaluation of digital agriculture recommendations with causal inference. In this context, we evaluate a recommendation system for the optimal sowing of cotton, given sowing time is of great importance for arable crops. Mistimed sowing can lead to suboptimal plant emergence and adversely affect the crop yield [ 32,10,7,44,49]. To the best of our knowledge, there are no works that evaluate the effectiveness of any type of decision support or recommendation system in the agricultural sector through causal reasoning and beyond their predictive accuracy [ 40,45]. The contributions of this work are summarized as follows: i) the design of the first empirical evaluation framework for digital agriculture based on causal inference; ii) the implementation of it to assess the impact of a recommendation system, which was operationally used in a real-world case study; iii) the identification of the causal effect of sowing recommendations on yield, its subsequent estimation, and the evaluation of estimates using refutation tests. 2 Case Study In this work, we implement the empirical evaluation of a knowledge-based recommendation system [2] for optimal cotton sowing, which aims to make farmers’ production, and hence their profit, resilient against climate change. The recommendations are based on satisfying specific environmental conditions, as retrieved from the related literature, which would ensure successful cotton planting.
