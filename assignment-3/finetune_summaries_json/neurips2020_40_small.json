This is largely due to lack of in-situ labels for training and validating machine learning classiﬁers. Previously, we developed a method for binary classiﬁcation of cropland that learns from sparse local labels and abundant global labels using a multi-headed LSTM and time- series multispectral satellite inputs over one year. In this work, we present a new method that uses an autoregressive LSTM to classify cropland during the growing season (i.e., partially-observed time series). We used these methods to produce publicly-available 10m-resolution cropland maps in Kenya for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 growing seasons. These are the highest-resolution and most recent cropland maps publicly available for Kenya. These methods and associated maps are critical for scientiﬁc studies and decision-making at the intersection of food security and climate change. 1 Introduction Agriculture and climate change are entangled in a negative feedback loop, as agriculture is both a driver of climate change and one of the most vulnerable sectors impacted by it. Agriculture land use contributes to over 20% of global CO 2emissions and over half of CO 2emissions in Africa [3]. Still, this land use is critical for food security and economic development, yet global crop production is projected to decrease by 2-6% every decade due to climate change [ 24]. In a 2019 report, annual per capita maize production in Kenya was found to have declined from \u0018140kg per person in the early 1980s to 70 kg in 2010–2017 [ 4]. Hence, more timely and accurate mechanisms as well as investments that support the monitoring and forecasting of food security have become even more critical [ 1,16]. Climate-smart policies and practices that increase agricultural productivity and climate resilience without sacriﬁcing carbon sinks such as forests are needed to reverse these trends. Analyses such as grain yield and production estimates are needed to help design future climate-smart initiatives, but these analyses require accurate, up-to-date maps of where and which crops are being grown at the ﬁeld scale. These datasets do not exist or are not publicly accessible for most of Africa. \u0003Both authors contributed equally to this research.

Figure 1: Models for post-season (a) and in-season (b) crop classiﬁcation Machine learning techniques that use Earth observation (EO) data are a promising approach to generate cropland maps, but existing approaches often cover small (e.g., [ 11,17,9,18,26,15]) or homogeneous (e.g., [ 12,27,23]) areas, require large labeled datasets for training (e.g [ 20,2,10]), and/or lack sufﬁcient resolution for identify smallholder farms (e.g., [ 21,28]).
