However, the speed and compute cost of vessel detection are essential for a timely intervention to prevent illegal fishing. Therefore, we investigated optimization methods that lower detection time and cost with minimal performance loss. We trained an object detection model based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) using a dataset of satellite images. Then, we designed two efficiency optimizations that can be applied to the base CNN or any other base model. The optimizations consist of a fast, cheap classification model and a statistical algorithm. The integration of the optimizations with the object detection model leads to a trade-off between speed and performance. We studied the trade-off using metrics that give different weight to execution time and performance. We show that by using a classification model the average precision of the detection model can be approximated to 99.5% in ±44% of the time or to 92.7% in ±25% of the time. 1 Introduction Biodiversity conservation and climate change are significant and current global issues. A major contemporary problem in biodiversity conservation is overfishing, which often results from Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated (IUU) fishing. It is estimated that IUU fishing is responsible for 30% of all fishing in the world, with an estimated economic loss of up to $23 billion per year [ 1]. Not only do illegal activities threaten marine ecosystems, but the resistance of many marine species to climate change is compromised by overfishing, which increases the vulnerability of marine fisheries production to ocean warming. Furthermore, ongoing warming will impede efforts to recover overfished populations [ 2]. Satellite imagery can be used to detect vessels on sea and to determine if these vessels are conducting illegal activities. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images are created using satellites that emit radio waves towards the earth and capture the waves reflected back by objects [ 3]. When a ship is detected on these images, it can be determined whether a corresponding Automatic Identification Signal (AIS), which all ships should transmit every few seconds, can be linked to that ship. If this is not the case, the ship could possibly be conducting illegal activities [4]. Some satellites can image about 7 million square miles per day and thus various machine learning algorithms are used nowadays to detect ships in these SAR ∗Corresponding author.

However, current models are not yet able to process the SAR data both efficiently and with high accuracy, which results in high resource costs and which could impede their use in real-time systems. Therefore, there is a need for models that can quickly and accurately detect ships in SAR images o allow the Coast Guard to take timely and efficient action when the models detect illegal fishing [ 6]. The speed and performance of machine learning models are often negatively correlated and, therefore, it is necessary to make an appropriate trade-off for this. Figure 1: Overview of the optimizations and the detection model. If in a first step, a fast algorithm predicts that no ship is present, the expensive detection model is skipped.We investigated optimiza- tions for machine learning models, agnostic as to how the base model functions, that detect ships in SAR im- ages to make the best pos- sible trade-off. These opti- mizations consist of a fast classification model and a statistical algorithm. Their goal is to efficiently deter- mine as a first step whether at least one ship is present in an SAR image before ap- plying the expensive base detection model. Figure 1 gives an overview. 2 Related Work The launch of the first SAR satellite in the United States in 1978 led to the emergence of several SAR ship detection methods [ 7]. These initial methods are based on traditional detection methods that manually design features [ 8,9,10]. These traditional methods proved too slow, required complex manual work and were inaccurate [ 11]. The rise of neural networks led to the use of advanced object detection techniques due to their higher accuracy and lesser need for human intervention. This was also the case for the SAR ship detection community: the proliferation of SAR data [ 12] in recent years has contributed to the increase in the use of deep learning (DL) in SAR ship detection [ 13,14,15]. In these models, the traditional features (such as gray level, HOG, etc.) are replaced by features produced by CNNs. The SAR dataset used in this study is the Large-Scale SAR Ship Detection Dataset-v1.0 (LSSSDD) [ 16]. The dataset contains 15 SAR images from the Sentinel-1 satellite2, with a size of 16000 ×24000 pixels, divided into 900sub-images of size 800×800. 3 Efficiency optimizations A large percentage of the SAR sub-images do not contain ships and so time is lost by performing object detection on them.
