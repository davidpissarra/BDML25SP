We show that the inclusion of unﬂooded context for the area, or “memory,” allows the model to tap into a “prior state” of pre-ﬂood conditions, increasing performance in geographic regions in which single-image radar-based ﬂood mapping methods typically underperform (e.g. deserts). We focus on accuracy across different biomes to ensure global performance. Our experiments and novel data processing technique show that the con- ﬂuence of pre-ﬂood and permanent water context provides a 21% increase in mIoU over the base- line overall, and over 87% increase in deserts. 1. Introduction Climate change-driven ﬂood disasters are rapidly increasing in frequency and magnitude (UNDRR, 2015). More people are affected by ﬂooding than any other climate disaster (Hal- legatte et al., 2017; CRED, 2019), hindering sustainable development. Research consistently shows that relative property loss caused by ﬂoods are highest in places of social vulnerability (UNDRR, 2019; Ceola et al., 2014), exacer- bating economic disparities (Tellman et al., 2020). Readily available remote sensing satellite data allows for scalable, low cost, near-real time disaster monitoring and mapping in order to support response and relief. Multidisciplinary approaches to ﬂood detection algorithms, leveraging con- ventional remote sensing, hydrology, and machine learning, are paramount to using satellite imagery for effective ﬂood detection (Mateo-Garcia et al., 2021). Imagery from Sentinel-1, ESA’s synthetic aperture radar Figure 1. Memory To Map inference pipeline. The model com- bines multi-temporal contextual information, (pre-ﬂood and GSW) with ﬂooded radar imagery to improve segmentation performance for Sentinel-1. We hypothesize that the subtle changes in backscat- ter between the memory context and the ﬂood radar imagery could potentially be exploited by the model to improve performance. (SAR) satellite, is commonly used for ﬂood mapping as it is free, easily accessible, cloud penetrating (i.e. the image is not affected by the presence of clouds or other atmospheric conditions), and systemically acquired (Potin et al., 2014). However, the accuracy of SAR-derived ﬂood maps is often reduced due to multiple land surfaces - such as sandy river banks, deserts, recently cleared ﬁelds, and terrain shadows - appearing similar to ﬂood waters in backscatter images. Memory To Map introduces a pre-ﬂood image of the scene and a permanent water layer (derived from the the Joint Research Council Global Surface Water data v1.1 (hereafter “GSW”) (Pekel et al., 2016)) as input channels to the network which provide unﬂooded context, thereby leveraging change detection when segmenting water. Our approach resulted in signiﬁcant improvements over the base- line, as well as unique improvements in deserts and other areas that are particularly difﬁcult for ﬂood mapping us- ing SAR. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work of its type tested globally with accuracy measured across different biomes, motivated by the frequent ﬂooding in different biomes and the necessity of globally performant models. The framework introduced here for training andMemory to Map: Improving Radar Flood Maps With Temporal Context and Semantic Segmentation validating globally-applicable models is a key contribution of this work. Our approach can also serve as a template for using temporal information in semantic segmentation to detect ﬂooding in SAR images. We demonstrate a way to utilize accessible data sources to improve semantic segmentation of ﬂoods by 21% mean intersection over union (mIoU) overall, creating a model for generating high quality ﬂood maps across domains. We improved performance in uniquely challenging regions such as deserts, in which we found a 87% increase in mIoU, making a ﬂood mapping network useful for global applica- tions. The use of a globally-distributed dataset for training and validation constitutes a major beneﬁt of this model and substantially broadens the applicability of our results.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters removed:\n\nSentinel-1 imagery is used to show that including un-flooded context for the area, or \"memory,\" allows the model to tap into a \"prior state\" of pre-flood conditions, increasing performance in geographic regions where single-image radar-based flood mapping methods typically underperform, such as deserts. We focus on accuracy across different biomes to ensure global performance. Our experiments and novel data processing technique show that the confluence of pre-flood and permanent water context provides a 21% increase in mean intersection over union (mIoU) over the baseline overall, and over 87% increase in deserts.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nClimate change-driven flood disasters are rapidly increasing in frequency and magnitude (UNDRR, 2015). More people are affected by flooding than any other climate disaster (Hallegatte et al., 2017; CRED, 2019), hindering sustainable development.
