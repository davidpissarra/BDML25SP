Accurate estimation and monitoring of SOC is crucial for understanding climate dynamics and driving sustainable land management and agricultural practices. Climate change profoundly impacts SOC dynamics by influencing various processes related to plant growth, microbial activity, and organic matter decomposition. Traditional methods of SOC estimation often face challenges in spatial resolution, coverage, and accuracy, particularly when applied at larger scales or diverse landscapes [1]. Recent technological advancements brought SOC monitoring to a new level, employing methods like remote sensing, machine learning, and satellite-driven high-resolution mapping [ 2,3]. Satellite imagery offers a scalable and cost-effective solution, capturing spatial heterogeneity, temporal dynamics of SOC, and variability of climate features across regions, from South Africa’s diverse landscapes [4] to Bavaria’s agriculturally intensive zones [5]. Graph Neural Networks have the ability to model complex interdependencies between SOC and multifaceted climate features. By design they excel at capturing relational information in data [ 6], which makes them indespansable for modelling the relationship between soil and climate. For instance, integrating positional encoders [ 7] in GNNs allows them to capture the spatial dependencies crucial for geographic data. Furthermore, GNNs that learn both structural and positional representations provide a comprehensive understanding, ensuring that elements’ composition and spatial distribution are considered. In this paper, we propose applying advanced GNN operators [ 8,9,10,11] to the positional encoder framework [ 7] for SOC estimation. We aim to use their relational modelling capabilities and computational optimizations to deliver accurate, detailed, and scalable SOC predictions across diverse climate-related features.

One widely adopted approach to address this challenge is through the notion of message passing or neighbourhood aggregation. In this context, let’s define x(k) i∈RFas the features associated with node iat the kth layer, ej,i∈RDrepresents the edge features from node jto node i. Given this, the operation of message-passing can be articulated as: x(k) i=γ(k) x(k−1) i,M j∈N(i)ϕ(k)\u0010 x(k) i,x(k−1) j,ej,i\u0011  (1) whereLis a differentiable function that remains invariant to permutations.
