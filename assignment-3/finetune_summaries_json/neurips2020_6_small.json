In this work, we develop a variety of state-of-the-art probabilistic models for forecasting solar irradiance. We investigate the use of post-hoc calibration techniques for ensuring well-calibrated probabilistic predictions. We train and evaluate the models using public data from seven stations in the SURFRAD network, and demonstrate that the best model, NGBoost, achieves higher performance at an intra-hourly resolution than the best benchmark solar irradiance forecasting model across all stations. Further, we show that NGBoost with CRUDE post-hoc calibration achieves comparable performance to a numerical weather prediction model on hourly-resolution forecasting. 0 200 400 600 800 10000100200300400500600Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI)True Predicted Time (\u00198 days in January 2018) Figure 1: Several days of 30-min horizon NGBoost irradiance forecasts on the Sioux Falls station [ 1]. 1 Introduction Increasing adoption of renewable energy in the electricity sector is essential to the reduction of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, but signiﬁcant production increases must occur in order to phase out fossil fuel use [ 2,3]. Solar power production has grown dramatically, ranking in the top two electricity-generating capacity additions over the past seven years in the U.S., with 40% of new electric capacity in the grid coming from solar in 2019 [ 4]. However, due to the high volatility and intermittency of solar energy, solar forecasting methods have become necessary to increase the penetration of solar power into the grid while ensuring power system cost-effectiveness and security [5]. These methods often forecast solar irradiance, which is widely available and correlates strongly with solar photovoltaic (PV) output [ 6]. While solar forecasting has received extensive attention in the literature [ 7,8,5,9], it was noted by [ 10] that the overwhelming majority of solar forecasting methods are not probabilistic. Solar forecasting methods that characterize uncertainty have the potential to aid real-time grid integration of solar energy and help gauge when to deploy new storage [ 11,12].

Recent advancements in probabilistic modeling and uncertainty estimation present an opportunity to substantially improve solar irradiance forecasting. The development of probabilistic solar irradiance forecasting models is advancing [ 14,15], but most of these methods use numerical weather prediction (NWP) and traditional statistical approaches for producing probabilistic outputs [ 16,17]. Moreover, many of the traditional approaches like NWP models are primarily useful on hourly timescales and introduce extensive computational overhead, whereas the best choice for short-term, intra-hourly forecasting has remained open [ 18]. Deep learning methods for probabilistic solar forecasting have recently begun to emerge, but have not been widely adopted as they have not yet demonstrated superior performance over traditional methods [ 19]. Furthermore, recent advances in machine learning have developed post-hoc calibration techniques for encouraging well-calibrated predictions [20, 21], but these methods have yet to be used in solar irradiance forecasting [18]. In this work, we develop and validate several probabilistic solar irradiance forecasting models using public data from seven meteorological stations in the U.S. [ 1]. We compare the performance of the probabilistic models together with several modern post-hoc calibration methods to state-of-the-art benchmarks from [ 18]. We demonstrate that the best model outperforms the alternatives across all seven stations for intra-hourly forecasting and performs comparably to numerical weather prediction (NWP) models on hourly-resolution forecasting. This work advances solar irradiance forecasting by developing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and associated post-hoc calibration techniques for signiﬁcant improvements in solar forecasting. 2 Methods Data.
