Keywords: food waste ; date label policy; text analysis   Introduction   Food waste is one of the most  significant driver s of climate  change, constituting  up to  10% of all greenhouse gas emis- sions, 14% of all water use, 18% of all cropland use, and  24% of all landfill content (Hall et al., 20 09; Quested, Ingle,  and Parry, 2013 ). The reduction of food waste is a key cli- mate change strategy (Hawke n, 2017),  and is  a challenge  that depends on a host of actors across all steps of the supply  chain. Strong  federal  and state policy is one of the most  promising avenues for mitigating food waste and stimulat- ing food recovery  (Evans and Nagele, 2018). One key food  waste polic y in this area  and which is well-represented at the  state level is date label policy.     Date label policy applies to  whether manufacturers must  include labels on certain food (e.g., milk, meat) and whether  the product may be sold past the date, and other  require- ments  such as the use of specific terminology (e.g., “Best    Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelli- gence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.    by,” “Sell by,” “Use by”). Currently, instead of a  federally - enforced  standard policy, there is a patchwork of date label  policies across states  that grants free reign to manufacturers  and, in turn, creates confusion for consumers (Broad Leib  and Pollans, 2019; Broad Leib et al., 2016). For example,  consum ers may incorrectly believe that food should be dis- carded once past its date, whereas some dates may only be  indicators of quality rather than wholesomeness ( Busetti,  2019 ). It has been suggested that states with more extensive  date label policy (i.e., mor e requirements  and/or restrictions)  contribute to  rather than reduce food waste ( Lipinski et al.,  2013; Povich, 20 20). However, there is a paucity of empiri- cal evidence regarding the impact of these policies on rele- vant outcomes.    Therefore, it is essential to empirically evaluate  the extent  to which state date label  polic ies contribute to waste and im- pacts the environment. One challenge in accomplishing this  goal is that these policies can be generally opaque due to  legal jargon  and require expert analysis to distill. For exam- ple, beyond reading and comprehending a state’s date label  policy, an expert must also be able to evaluate the strengths  and weakness of the policy with respect to relevant policy at  the federal level and in ot her states as well as with respect  to the nuances of the issue at hand (i.e., knowing which pol- icy features are more or less beneficial in combating climate  change). In such an evaluation, subject matter experts may  differ in the extent to which they agree  about which policy  features  should be considered  (i.e., which are most relevant  to the efficacy of the policy) as well as how to judge  quali- tative aspects of the policy (e.g., strength, extensiveness),  requiring prolonged discussions and recalibration. Such an  effort is extensive and time -consuming, which is far from  ideal given the significance of food waste in driving climate  change and the urgency for policymakers to craft effective  and relevant policies.         ©2022 The MITRE Corporation.
