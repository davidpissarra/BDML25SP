The design and intelligent control for data centers have an important impact on data center carbon footprint. In this paper, we showcase PyDCM, a Python library that enables extremely fast pro- totyping of data center design and applies reinforcement learning-enabled control with the purpose of evaluating key sustainability metrics including carbon footprint, energy consumption, and observing temperature hotspots. We demonstrate these capabilities of PyDCM and compare them to existing works in EnergyPlus for modeling data centers. PyDCM can also be used as a standalone Gymnasium environment for demonstrating sustainability-focused data center control. 1 Introduction Enterprise data centers (DC) generate a massive carbon footprint relative to commercial buildings of similar sizes Reuther and et al. (2022). This can be attributed to the high density of servers and associated CPU workloads that are scheduled throughout the day. The heat generated by these servers also needs to be ducted through an elaborate Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HV AC) system from the IT Room to the outside environment through computer room air conditioning (CRAC) units, chillers, evaporators, pumps, fans, and cooling towers. The HV AC system also consumes a large amount of energy and has a significant carbon footprint depending on the workload of the data center, the weather conditions, and the grid renewable and non-renewable energy mix termed as the grid carbon intensity (CI).

Researchers have been relying on tools such as EnergyPlus Crawley and et al. (2000) or Modelica Luk. and Bog. (2019) based models for design and control, which, in combination with interface software such as Sinergym Jiménez-Raboso and et al. (2021) and PyFMU pyf (2023), allow for test of reinforcement learning (RL)-based controllers. However, there is considerable communication overhead between the modeling platforms and the RL controller, with the latter being commonly designed in Python programming language. Hence, researchers tend to develop such models in Python for ease of use. One such modeling approach, CityLearn Vázquez-Canteli and et al. (2019), has been very popular among smart grid researchers. Our work aims to provide the data center designer and machine learning communities with novel ways in Python to approach the sustainability target using both design and machine learning approaches. Specifically, the approach demonstrates the ability to generate custom data center configurations, study data center heat maps, and develop carbon-aware control applications using Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), that incentivize lower carbon footprint while optimizing the HV AC cooling setpoint for the IT room. 2 System Architecture An overview of the proposed architecture with the proposed use cases is shown in figure 1.
