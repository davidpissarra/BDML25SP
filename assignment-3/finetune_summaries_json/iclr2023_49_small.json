It uses the latest open-access dataset of the daily wind capacity factor in 28 European countries between 1979 and 2019 and proposes several user-configurable visualizations of the temporal and spatial variations of the wind power capacity factor. The platform allows for a deep analysis of the distribution, the cross-country correlation, and the drivers of low wind power events. It offers an easy-to-use interface that makes it suitable for the needs of researchers and stakeholders. The tool is expected to be useful in identifying areas of high wind potential and possible challenges that may impact the large-scale deployment of wind turbines in Europe. Particular importance is given to the visualization of low wind power events and to the potential of cross-border cooperations in mitigating the variability of wind in the context of increasing reliance on weather-sensitive renewable energy sources. 1 I NTRODUCTION As the world is facing an unprecedented energy crisis, more and more investments are going into intermittent renewable energy sources (IRES). IRENA’s (2019) analysis forecasts wind power to represent 40 percent of the EU-28 electricity needs in 2050. As energy production depends more and more on weather conditions, there is a call for tools that could help in better understanding and dealing with the risks that this can present. Wind variability poses a significant challenge to energy production, as it can lead to fluctuations in power output, making it difficult to manage energy supply (Staffell & Pfenninger, 2018). Therefore, understanding the historical variability of wind power is essential to make well-informed decisions regarding the future deployment and management of wind turbines. One solution to the problem of wind variability is cross-border cooperation, which allows countries to share their wind resources and balance out variations in power output. In January 2023, the European Commission called for cross-border renewable energy projects (European Climate Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency, 2023), and more and more attention is given to the study of the existing and the future necessary regulations, policies, and incentives (Aras, 2021; Ecofys and eclareon, 2023; EEA, 2020; Kerres et al., 2020). However, to effectively implement cross-border cooperation, a deep understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of wind energy in different countries and regions is needed. This is where data-mining visualization tools can play a crucial role by providing an intuitive and interactive way to explore and analyze wind data from different regions, helping to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues that would be difficult to discern from raw data alone. In this paper, we present a dashboard-like data-mining interface that aims at making the historical spatial and temporal variability of wind power more accessible to decision-makers. We also hope to bridge the gap between the available climate data and the needs of the energy industry look- ing for a more intelligible analysis tool that: (1) Uses the latest open-access dataset of the daily wind capacity factor in 28 European countries between 1979 and 2019; (2) Proposes more than 16 fully-configurable visualizations of the temporal (intraday, intrayear, year-over-year), and spa- tial variations of the wind power capacity factor; (3) Allows a deep analysis of the distribution, the 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 cross-country correlations of the temporal distribution, and the drivers of low wind power events of different European countries. We expect the platform to be useful to (1): Researchers seeking visual representations of the his- torical variability of wind power, the possible obstacles to the reliability of a power supply system highly relying on wind, and more generally to the large-scale integration of wind power into the grid; provide stakeholders (2) with valuable insights into the potential of countries for wind energy development, as well as the potential for regional cooperation and help them make well-informed decisions. 2 D ATASET,DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT SPECIFICS Dataset. The dataset used here is an ERA5-derived time series of European country-aggregate elec- tricity wind power generation (Bloomfield et al., 2020). The authors use the ERA5 reanalysis data (Hersbach et al., 2020) to compute the nationally aggregated hourly capacity factor of 28 European countries between 1979 and 2019. The capacity factor of a wind turbine is the ratio of the electrical energy produced by the turbine for the period of time considered to the total amount of electrical energy that could have been produced at full power operation during the same period. Further details regarding the data are given in appendix A1. Software Framework.
