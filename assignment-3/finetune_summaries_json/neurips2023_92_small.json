The study introduces an ethical framework that leverages  machine learning and geospatial techniques to enable the large-scale integration  of data, facilitating the mapping of energy consumption data at the individual  building level. Utilizing the Alaska Retrofit Information System (ARIS) and the  USA Structures datasets, this framework not only identifies and acknowledges  limitations inherent in existing datasets but also establishes a robust ethical  foundation for data integration. This framework innovation sets a noteworthy  precedent for the responsible utilization of data in the domain of climate justice  research, ultimately informing the development of sustainable energy policies  through an enhanced understanding of building data and advancing ongoing  research agendas. Future research directions involve the incorporation of  recently released datasets, which provide precise building location data, thereby  further validating the proposed ethical framework and advancing efforts in  addressing Alaska's intricate energy challenges. 1 Introduction Alaska faces unique energy challenges stemming from its remote location, extreme weather, and  reliance on fossil fuels [1, 2]. One key barrier is the lack of granular, large-scale data on building  energy demands, which is essential to decarbonization efforts in supporting climate change  mitigation. While previous efforts have manually collected heating load measurements, these  studies cover only small areas. In contrast, the Alaska Retrofit Information System (ARIS) [3, 4]  contains a much more extensive database of home energy audits. ARIS was recently released for  public use, however, records have been de-identified in terms of geolocation to only zip codes to  protect personal and private information. This paper introduces a novel framework combining machine learning and geospatial techniques  to map ARIS home energy data at the building level, at scale. The framework presents an ethical  approach for integrating the ARIS database with housing attributes from the USA Structures  dataset [5]. Through clustering and validation, the framework accurately matches records across  datasets while protecting privacy, using clustering to match records privately. The contributions of  this paper are threefold: 1) highlighting current limitations in key energy data sources; 2)  providing an ethical framework for integrating such datasets at scale using machine learning; and  3) demonstrating how this approach can inform sustainable energy policy through improved  understanding of building energy loads. Ethical considerations are paramount when utilizing geospatial data on real individuals for climate  justice [6]. Researchers must minimize privacy risks and socio-environmental disparities. Proper  consent, anonymization, communication, and assessing long-term impacts are critical for ethical  data use aligned with equity.

Overall, this work exemplifies how artificial intelligence  and geospatial big data can further renewable energy goals while prioritizing transparency and  fairness. 2 Previous Work Traditional geospatial analysis methods have played a role in understanding spatial patterns and  making informed decisions in various domains, including energy resource management; however,  these methods have limitations [7]. In contrast, cloud-based geospatial analytics techniques, such  as Google Earth Engine (GEE), have emerged as a leading technique in geospatial analysis  [8]–[12], offering major data archives and enabling users to perform complex geospatial tasks at  scale [13]–[15] including analysis of renewable energy potential and energy infrastructure changes  [16]–[22].
