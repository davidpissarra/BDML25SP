To allow for the grid to rely heavily on renewables, important operational changes must be done. For example, novel approaches for frequency regulation, i.e., for balancing in real-time demand and generation, are required to ensure the stability of a renewable electric system. Demand response programs in which loads adjust in part their power consumption for the grid’s beneﬁt, can be used to provide frequency regulation. In this proposal, we present and motivate a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to meet the algorithmic requirements for providing real-time power balancing with demand response. 1 Introduction Climate change mitigation brings about important transformations in the electric power system. In 2019, the United States (U.S.) Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) reported that 25% of the country’s greenhouse gas emission came from electricity generation [ 2]. The EPA further noted that 62% of the U.S. electricity was generated from burning fossil fuel [ 1]. In an effort to cut down and ultimately eliminate greenhouse gas emissions produced by the electricity sector, the power grid is moving from a conventional, fuel-burning to a renewable, natural phenomenon-based generation, e.g., wind turbine and solar photovoltaics. Apart from the immediate ﬁnancial consequence of deploying new generators, electric grid operations must undergo an important paradigm shift as future energy systems will rely on uncertain, fast-ramping, and intermittent sources of power, i.e., renewables [ 27,6]. Without a renewed way of operating the power grid, the transition toward a renewable energy grid is hardly conceivable. Speciﬁcally, to ensure the stability of the electric grid, a near-perfect balance between the power demand and generation is critical [ 14]. Hence, trading a constant, deterministic generation for an intermittent, uncertain one – the now renewable generation – imposes operational challenges to system operators as the need for power balancing is exacerbated. At the second timescale, this balancing task is referred to as frequency regulation [ 6,27] because a grid frequency at its nominal value, viz. 60 Hz in North America and 50 Hz in Europe, indicates a balanced load-generation [14]. 1.1 Demand response for renewable integration Demand response [ 26,20,25] (DR) of ﬂexible loads is a greenhouse gas emission-free, and renewable alternative to provide frequency regulation services [ 7,27] and hence to cope with renewable intermittency instead of relying, for example, on conventional power plants [ 22,21] or expansive battery energy storage [ 11,9,34]. DR refers to programs in which loads, e.g. residential households, modulate their non-critical power consumption following an aggregator’s or system operator’s Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.instructions (e.g., turning on or off air conditioning units) or signals (e.g., increasing/decreasing electricity rates). For example, this can represent a house that accepts to have its air conditioning unit be turned OFF andONsuccessively to track the output of a wind turbine as long as its temperature is within an acceptable range, e.g., between 20\u000eC and 22\u000eC. Loads constrained by temperature requirements are referred to as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). DR is an attractive prospect for power balancing because of its fast response and of its low deployment required investments [ 27]. Fast timescale DR like frequency regulation requires algorithmic approaches that provide actions within a few seconds or less. These actions must account for the dynamic behavior of the controllable loads and the uncertainty of both the environment, e.g. changing weather, and the loads, e.g. erratic costumer behavior. Moreover, DR requires a large number of loads to provide a sustained level of controllable power and hence to be able to track regulation setpoints, i.e. the power imbalances. Frequency regulation DR is, therefore, intrinsically a cooperative multi-agent problem. 1.2 Motivation for a machine learning-based approach In sum, four critical design aspects impose tough constraints on the algorithmic design of frequency regulation DR: (i) adaptivity under uncertainty, (ii) computational efﬁciency for real-time decision- making, (iii) sequential decision-making for dynamic environments, and (iv) scalability to and cooperativity in multi-agent settings. Several frameworks have been considered for this problem but were all insufﬁciently addressing at least one aspect. For example, model predictive control (MPC) approaches [ 13,18,17] integrate the sequential decision-making component of the problem and adequately model system dynamics but are subject to an important computational burden due to the receding horizon formulation. The resulting is, therefore, not suitable for real-time implementation. Online optimization approaches [ 15,16] address this issue; they offer very efﬁcient algorithms to deploy DR resources in real-time but they are mostly greedy, i.e., they do not account for the system’s dynamics. Finally, the multi-agent aspect\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
