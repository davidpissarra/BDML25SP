Methane sensor networks are a promising technology to detect methane leaks in a timely manner. While they provide near-real-time monitoring of an area of interest, the density of the network can be cost prohibitive, and the identiﬁcation of the source of the leak is not apparent, especially where there could be more than one source. To address these issues, we developed a machine learning framework that leverages various data sources including oil and gas facilities data, historical methane leak rate distribution and meteorological data, to optimize sensor place- ment. The determination of sensor locations follows the objective to maximize the detection of possible methane leaks with a limited sensor budget. 1 Introduction Methane (CH 4), the primary component of natural gas, is a potent greenhouse gas with a Global Warming Potential (GWP) of 84-87 over a 20-year timescale ( 1). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recommends, with high conﬁdence, that reduction of anthropogenic methane emissions is an efﬁcient way to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2030 (2). The global oil and gas industry is one of the primary sources of anthropogenic methane emissions, with signiﬁcant leaks occurring across the entire oil and gas value chain, from production and processing to transmission, storage, and distribution ( 1). Capacity limitations in gathering, processing and transportation infrastructure can lead to venting/ﬂaring of excess CH 4. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that it is possible to avoid around 70% of today’s methane emissions from global oil and gas operations with existing technologies ( 3). These statistics drive home the importance of leveraging various methane detection technologies along with machine learning to address this critical issue. To measure CH 4emissions, several methane-sensing instruments are used, with different sensitivities, spatiotemporal resolutions, collection techniques and cost, and frequency of collection. Various approaches have been proposed to detect methane emissions and leaks using different emerging \u0003These authors contributted equally to the paper yCorresponding author: saramalvar@microsoft.com Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021methane-sensing technologies such as mobile methane detection and quantiﬁcation of leaks and monitoring with satellite ( 4;5), monthly and interannual aerial surveys to monitor CH 4persistence (6;7), FLIR cameras based on optical gas imaging technologies for detecting leakages with high conﬁdence ( 8), IoT sensor grids for measuring real-time methane concentrations ( 9) and stationary sensors to quantify sources of emissions and for monitoring large areas of interest ( 10;11). One of the technologies used to help with methane leak detection and remediation efforts (LDAR) is ground sensor networks ( 12). While sensors can provide realtime/near realtime measurements of methane concentration, the key challenge in employing them over a large area of interest - say, the size of the Permian Basin in Texas, USA - would be the prohibitive cost of dense sensor placement. While ground sensors can provide realtime/near-realtime measurements of methane concentration, challenges arise in deploying them in a stationary conﬁguration for maximum detection of leaks within an area of interest that may contain multiple sources and establishing attribution to a given source based on sensor readings. This underscores the importance of a robust sensor placement optimization method to support LDAR efforts. To tackle this task, Klise et al. ( 11) proposed an optimization strategy leveraging atmospheric dispersion and transport models and developed an open-source Python package named Chama. The maximum-coverage problem is formulated based on simulated methane dispersion maps and solved by mixed-integer linear programming formulations, considering the ingested sensor data, such as sensitivities, number of sensors and budget. This strategy starts from initialized sensor locations and ﬁnds the optimal subset as the result, but it is highly dependent on the initialization of the sensor locations, that can only be placed on a speciﬁc subset of initial positions. In our framework, the maximum-coverage problem is solved using a machine learning (ML) unsupervised approach. In this paper, we propose a framework to incorporate various oil and gas assets, leak/methane emission history, meteorological data, topographical data, and pollutant dispersion and transport into machine learning methods to suggest a sparse sensor placement in a stationary network for an area of interest. The objective is to maximize the detection of all emissions sources and facilitate leak source attribution, thereby helping mitigate and remediate methane emissions in an accurate and timely manner. 2 Proposed sensor placement optimization method for methane leak detection The major innovation of the proposed method is that it provides an unsupervised learning solution by leveraging the methane geospatial features generated from dispersion and transport models.
