Thus, energy sector is placed at the heart of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts (1;2). During the last decade, renewable technologies have seen considerable advances, and solar and wind energy have had dramatic growth trajectories. This is manifested by the large deployment of renewables. At the end of 2018, the global cumulative renewable installed capacity is 2.5 TW with an annual growth rate of 8% ( 1). The cost of energy continues its decline, accelerated by technological progress, and this trend is projected to continue. In fact, the weighted Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of solar photovoltaic at utility-scale has reached USD 50 per MWh in 2017, down from USD 180 per MWh in 2009 ( 3). Arguably, renewables represent the most economical solution for new capacity in a growing number of countries and regions. Despite this success, there is still some way to go to ensure better pene- tration of renewables into an energy market mostly based on fossil fuels. To this end, it is important to continue on the path of cost reduction whether in capital (Capex) or operating (Opex) expenditures. In this project, the focus will be on the reduction of the overall electricity cost by the reduction of operating expen- ditures, including maintenance costs. We propose a predic- tive maintenance (PdM) framework for multi-component systems in renewables power plants based on machine learn- ing (ML) and optimization approaches.

Morocco has launched an ambitious energy strategy since 2009 that aims to ensure the energy security of the country, diversify the source of energy and preserve the environment. Ultimately, Morocco has set the target of 52% of renewables by 2030 with a large capital investment of USD 30 billion ( 4). To this end, Morocco will install 10 GW allocated as follows: 45% for solar, 42% for wind and 13% for hydro, avoiding the emission of approxi- mately 21 millions tonnes of CO2. Through the commitment of many actors, in particular in Research and Development, Morocco intends to become a regional leader and a model to follow in its climate change efforts. MASEN is investing in several strategies to reduce the cost of renewables, including the cost of operations and maintenance. Our project will provide a ML predictive maintenance framework to support these efforts. 2. Predictive maintenance process PdM aims to predict when system failure might occur, and to prevent the occurrence of failure by performing mainte- nance. It allows the maintenance frequency to be as low as possible to prevent unplanned corrective maintenance, without incurring costs associated with doing too much sys- tematic preventive maintenance ( 5;6). Experts agree PdM could reduce maintenance cost by 10% to 40% ( 7). It also improves the availability, the reliability, and the security of critical components. System structures become more and more complex with a large number of components and very complex interac- tions between them. Wind turbines are a good example of complex systems. They are composed of several criti- cal components such as the blades, the pitch, the gearbox and the generator and they present impressive characteris- tics such as the hub height, rotor diameter or rated power. They normally run on a 24/7 schedule, are geographically distributed and operating under arduous conditions. Each unexpected failure can lead to a drop in availability and huge ﬁnancial losses. Therefore, they are ideal candidates for savings through PdM. According to International Standard ISO 13381- 1 ( 5), PdMML-based Predictive Maintenance process can be divided into three different steps, namely: (i) Diagnostics, (ii) Prognostics and (iii) Decision Making. Diagnostics involves fault detection, isolation (which com- ponent is failed), failure mode identiﬁcation (what is the cause of failure) and degradation level assessment (quantiﬁ- cation of failure severity). The prognostics task consists of determining the Remaining Useful Life (RUL). The RUL is the lead-time to failure and a good RUL prediction accuracy is critically important since\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe energy sector is at the heart of climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts, aiming to reach 65% of the world's primary energy supply by 2050, up from 15% today. Over the last decade, renewable technologies have seen significant advances, with solar and wind energy experiencing dramatic growth trajectories. This is evident in the large deployment of renewables, with a global cumulative installed capacity of 2.5 TW by the end of 2018, and an annual growth rate of 8%. The cost of energy continues to decline, driven by technological progress, and this trend is expected to continue. The weighted Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of solar photovoltaic at utility-scale has reached USD 50 per MWh in 2017, down from USD 180 per MWh in 2009.\n\nRenewables represent the most economical solution for new capacity in a growing number of countries and regions. However, there is still a need to improve the penetration of renewables into an energy market largely based on fossil fuels. To achieve this, it is essential to continue reducing costs, whether in capital (Capex) or operating (Opex) expenditures. This project focuses on reducing the overall electricity cost by minimizing operating expenditures, including maintenance costs.\n\nA predictive maintenance (PdM) framework for multi-component systems in renewables power plants will be developed using machine learning (ML) and optimization approaches. This project will benefit from a real database acquired from the Moroccan Agency of Sustainable Energy (MASEN), which owns and operates several wind, solar, and hydro power plants across Moroccan territory. Morocco has set an ambitious energy strategy since 2009, aiming to ensure energy security, diversify energy sources, and preserve the environment. The country aims to reach 52% of renewables by 2030, with a significant investment of USD 30 billion.\n\nThe project will provide a ML-based predictive maintenance framework to support MASEN's efforts to reduce the cost of renewables, including operations and maintenance costs.
