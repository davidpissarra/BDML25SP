On high fire-risk days, a small fire ignition can rapidly grow and get out of control. Early detection of fire ignitions from initial smoke can assist response to such fires before they become difficult to manage. Past deep learning approaches for wildfire smoke detection have suffered from small or unreliable datasets that make it difficult to extrapolate performance to real-world scenarios. In this work, we present the Fire Ignition Library (FIgLib), a publicly-available dataset of nearly 25,000 labeled wildfire smoke images as seen from fixed-view cameras deployed in Southern California. We also introduce SmokeyNet, a novel deep learning architecture using spatio-temporal information from camera imagery for real-time wildfire smoke detection. When trained on the FIgLib dataset, SmokeyNet outperforms comparable baselines. We hope that the availability of the FIgLib dataset and the SmokeyNet architecture will inspire further research into deep learning methods for wildfire smoke detection, leading to automated notification systems to reduce the time to wildfire response. 1 Introduction The size and frequency of wildland fires in the western United States have increased in recent years. In 2018 alone, 8,527 fires burned an area of 1.9 million acres (7,700 km2; nearly 2% of the stateâ€™s area) in California, with an estimated economic cost of $148.5 billion [1]. On high fire-risk days, a small fire ignition can rapidly grow and get out of control. Consequently, the detection of wildfires in the first few minutes after ignition is essential to minimizing their destruction. However, it can take much longer for a fire to be reported using existing methods, especially in areas with less human activity. Deep learning-based wildfire smoke detection systems can accurately and consistently detect wildfires and provide valuable intel to reduce the time to alert authorities. The goal of a wildfire smoke detection system can be structured as a binary image classification problem to determine the presence of smoke within a sequence of images. Priorities include quick time-to-detection, high recall to avoid missing potential fires, high precision to avoid frequent alarms that undermine trust in the system [ 2], and efficient performance to operate in real-time on edge devices. However, the task proves challenging in real-world scenarios given the transparent and amorphous nature of smoke; faint, small, or dissipating smoke plumes; and false positives from clouds, fog, and haze. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Even before the rise in popularity of deep learning methods, the visual (e.g. color), spatial, and temporal (i.e. motion) features of smoke were recognized as essential for the machine detection of wildfires [ 3,4,5,6]. More recently, deep learning approaches use a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ 7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14], background subtraction [ 7,12,15], and object detection methods [ 14,16,17,18,19] to incorporate visual and spatial features. Long short- term memory (LSTM) networks [ 12,18] or optical flow [ 9,15,20] methods have been applied to incorporate temporal context from video sequences. However, the difficulty of acquiring a large, labeled wildfire smoke dataset has limited researchers to using small or unbalanced datasets [6, 18], manually searching for images online [ 8,11,13,18], or synthetically generating datasets [ 13,16,21]. To address the need for a consistent evaluation benchmark for real-world performance, we present the Fire Ignition Library (FIgLib), a publicly-available dataset of nearly 25,000 labeled wildfire smoke images as seen from fixed-view cameras in Southern California. We also introduce SmokeyNet, a novel deep learning architecture using spatio-temporal information from camera imagery for real-time wildfire smoke detection.

As of September 2021, the dataset consists of 315 fires from 101 cameras across 30 stations occurring between June 2016 and July 2021. Each sequence typically contains images from 40 minutes prior to and 40 minutes following the start of the fire, serving as binary smoke/no-smoke labels for each image.
