This necessitates a long-term planning of the joint power-NG system under representative demand and supply patterns, operational con- straints, and policy considerations.

Introduction One of the most significant societal challenges that we cur- rently face is to transition to a reliable, low-carbon, and sustainable energy system as soon as possible, and to meet the mid-century goal of limiting global warming below 2◦C (UN-FCCC 2015; Gielen et al. 2019). This requires a signif- icant use of renewable energy resources and well-planned integration of various energy vectors, including emerging clean energy sources such as hydrogen and other renew- able energy sources. Our work is motivated by the enor- mous potential of machine learning (ML) models in pro- moting sustainable energy systems. In particular, we focus on ML modeling for extracting a set of representative days from heterogeneous demand data associated with real-world *The first two authors contributed equally to this work.

In doing so, we leverage ML-extracted repre- sentative days to tractably solve an optimization problem that determines a capacity and network expansion plan for regional-scale energy systems such as that of New England.
