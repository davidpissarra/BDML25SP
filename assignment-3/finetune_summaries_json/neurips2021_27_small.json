Quantifying GHG emissions is crucial for accurate predictions of climate effects and to enforce emission trading schemes. The reporting of such emissions is only required in some countries, resulting in insufﬁcient global coverage. In this work, we propose an end-to-end method to predict power generation rates for fossil fuel power plants from satellite images based on which we estimate GHG emission rates. We present a multitask deep learning approach able to simultaneously predict: (i) the pixel-area covered by plumes from a single satellite image of a power plant, (ii) the type of ﬁred fuel, and (iii) the power generation rate. We then convert the predicted power generation rate into estimates for the rate at which CO 2is being emitted. Experimental results show that our model approach allows us to estimate the power generation rate of a power plant to within 139 MW (MAE, for a mean sample power plant capacity of 1177 MW) from a single satellite image and CO 2emission rates to within 311 t/h. This multitask learning approach improves the power generation estimation MAE by 39% compared to a baseline single-task network trained on the same dataset. 1 Introduction Despite a recent decrease in their use in most European countries, fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas, still account for 71% of the continent’s energy production [Eurostat, 2021]. This popularity comes at a dangerously high environmental cost that affects humanity in the long term: burning fossil fuels leads to air and water pollution, and constitutes the main driver of climate change. Quantifying GHG emissions from individual industrial sites typically requires the use of dedicated measuring devices that report detailed emission information, as may be mandated by environmental protection guidelines. Such data may be used to enforce environmental protection regulations or pollutant certiﬁcate trading schemes. Unfortunately, reporting requirements differ between countries, resulting in a highly heterogeneous coverage of GHG emission reportings, globally. In this work, we aim to estimate GHG emission rates for fossil fuel power plants at a given time through observations of the emitted plumes from Earth-observing satellites. GHG emission rates are correlated to power generation rates and as such can be related to the extent of plumes emerging from Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021.
