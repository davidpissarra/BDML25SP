Researchers have proposed several strategies to harness greener energy through oceans and use oceans as carbon sinks. However, the risks these strategies might pose to the ocean and marine ecosystem are not well understood. It is imperative that we quickly develop a range of tools to monitor ocean processes and marine ecosystems alongside the technology to deploy these solutions on a large scale into the oceans. Large arrays of inexpensive cameras placed deep underwater coupled with machine learning pipelines to automatically detect, classify, count and estimate fish populations have the potential to continuously monitor marine ecosystems and help study the impacts of these solutions on the ocean. In this proposal, we discuss the challenges presented by a dark artificially lit underwa- ter video dataset captured 500m below the surface, propose potential solutions to address these challenges, and present preliminary results from detecting and classifying 6 species of fish in deep underwater camera data. 1 Introduction Oceans and seas cover more than 70% of the planet. They directly employ 56 million people, host 80 percent of the planet’s biodiversity, regulate our climate and are responsible for at least 50% of oxygen on Earth. Despite their vital role in our climate, oceans have so far remained largely unobserved and not understood on a large scale owing to the extremely high costs and complexity involved in studying such a large ecosystem. Precisely because of their vastness and complexity, they play an outsized role in regulating our climate[1, 2, 3]. Many studies indicate that oceans act as a buffer against climate change[ 4,5]. Strategies to increase the alkalinity of the oceans and accelerate the weathering processes that naturally consume CO2 from the atmosphere[ 6] or harvest tidal energy to generate greener alternative energy [ 7,8,9] are proposed as potential solutions to harness oceans to mitigate climate change. Despite careful efforts by researchers to assess the risks involved with adopting these solutions, the long-term consequences of these strategies on the ocean ecosystem are not very well understood[ 10]. With aggressive targets needed to prevent average global temperature from rising more than 2◦C in the next few decades[ 11], we will need to adopt some or all of these strategies to be able to address this climate emergency Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.before fully understanding the risks these strategies might pose[ 12,13]. It is thus critical that we develop affordable, scalable and automated ocean monitoring solutions with low carbon footprints to closely monitor the effects of these solutions on the oceans and the marine ecosystems. We explore placing cheap underwater cameras along with a light source and bait deep underwater to acquire a dataset with different species of fish and apply machine learning techniques on this dataset to monitor marine ecosystems. The primary objective of this research is to detect and classify different species of fish in underwater video data. A secondary objective of this research is to determine the number of samples of different species of fish required to develop an efficient and accurate deep learning model to inform data collection and annotation efforts. In this proposal, we present the results from training a model to classify and detect 6 species of fish and argue that 2000 samples of each class are sufficient to train a model successfully. Additionally, we identify the challenges involved with detecting and classifying the rarer species in the dataset and propose strategies to address the challenges involved with this dataset. Finally, we identify the challenges and opportunities that must be solved to scale such a system worldwide to meaningfully tackle climate action. 1.1 Related Work Traditionally, ocean and marine ecosystems have been monitored using high frequency radar, ocean gliders and animal tagging[ 14,15,16]. These techniques are invasive, human resource intensive, expensive and will not scale to meet the climate emergency[ 17]. Much research is underway to replace these traditional monitoring techniques with different forms of electronic monitoring using audio and video devices like cameras, satellites, echosounders, and other acoustic devices[ 18,19,20,21,22,23]. However, image-based machine learning research for life underwater has been limited to deploying cameras on fishing vessels, shallow waters, aquariums or aquaculture establishments, with very limited work extending these camera monitoring systems to deep underwater because of the challenges involved in acquiring and analyzing underwater video data below the sunlight zone. To our knowledge, marine ecosystems at these depths have not been captured by cameras with these resolutions, and machine learning applications to analyse this data have not been explored. Continuous and automated video monitoring pipelines to estimate fish abundance will be an invaluable tool in assessing the impact of climate change on marine ecosystems.
