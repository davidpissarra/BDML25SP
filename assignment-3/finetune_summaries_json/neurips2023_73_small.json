These extreme events cause devastating impacts to people and 16 livelihoods across the planet as recently witnessed in the tragic flooding events in September 2023 17 in Libya [2]. In a changing climate, preparing for these extreme events becomes even more 18 important which requires, on the one hand, an understanding of their projected long-term changes 19 to make well-informed and robust adaptation decisions, and on the other hand, an improvement of 20 their near-term prediction skill to give people and other stakeholders such as governments and 21 humanitarian organizations more time to prepare ahead of an upcoming event. 22  23 To achieve this, investigating the low-frequency variability and patterns of the large-scale 24 atmospheric flow and their link to regional extremes is important, as they can act as mediators 25 between global patterns of change in the climate system and regional impacts. One common 26 approach to analyzing this low-frequency variability is the identification of recurrent and persistent 27 atmospheric states, so-called weather regimes. Typically, weather regimes are identified based on 28 statistical dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques informed by a physical understanding 29 of the underlying dynamics [3]. Such atmospheric circulation patterns have been used to disentangle 30    2 dynamic and thermodynamic components of climate change for extreme event attribution, to 31 downscale or bias-adjust climate models [4]–[6], and to quantify the role of atmospheric internal 32 variability in observed trends [7], [8]. Moreover, weather regimes have been shown to improve the 33 usability and skill of forecasts at sub-seasonal-to-seasonal timescales [9]–[12]. 34  35 To identify weather regimes, a combination of dimensionality reduction and clustering is commonly 36 applied to gridded geopotential height or sea level pressure data of the region of interest. Following 37 [13], principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means have established themselves as common 38 choices for dimensionality reduction and clustering respectively, although various other linear 39 statistical methods have been studied in the field [3]. Recent publications have also explored non-40 linear [14] and probabilistic [15] methods for identifying weather regimes. 41  42 While the relationship between weather regimes and extremes in local impact variables (e.g. extreme 43 precipitation) is a key motivation for their investigation, there are no comprehensive methods 44 available for identifying probabilistic weather regimes targeted to a specific impact variable, without 45 compromising regime completeness or persistence [16]–[18]. By 'targeting' weather regimes, we 46 mean identifying patterns in the high-dimensional space of atmospheric dynamics that are 47 particularly predictive of the local-scale variable in question while still capturing the full dynamics 48 of the atmospheric phase space. As this last point is particularly relevant for extending the forecast 49 range of the impact variable through the extended range predictability of the patterns, building a 50 purely predictive ML model of the impact variable is not useful in this context.  51  52 This paper presents a novel probabilistic machine learning method for identifying weather regimes 53 that captures the full phase space of atmospheric dynamics in a reduced space while providing 54 enhanced predictability of a local scale impact variable.
