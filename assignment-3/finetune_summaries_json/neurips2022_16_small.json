Re- newable energies introduce new challenges to power grids due to decentralization, reduced inertia and volatility in production. The operation of sustainable power grids with a high penetration of renewable energies requires new methods to an- alyze the dynamic stability. We provide new datasets of dynamic stability of synthetic power grids and find that graph neural networks (GNNs) are surprisingly effective at predicting the highly non-linear target from topological information only.

These are more decentralized and have less inertia than traditional power generators and their production is more volatile. Hence, sustainable power grids operate in different states and the frequency dynamics need to explored in more detail. 2) A higher global mean temperature increases the likelihood as well as the intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes or heatwaves [1, 2] which result in great challenges to power grids. Building a sustainable grid as well as increasing the resilience of existing power grids towards novel threats are challenging tasks on their own. Tackling climate change in the power grid sector calls for a solution to both at the same time and requires for new methods to investigate the dynamic stability. Predicting the dynamic stability is a challenging task and grid operators are currently limited to analyze individual contingencies in the current state of the transmission grid only. Conducting high-fidelity simulations of the whole dynamic hierarchy of the power grid and exploring all possible states is not feasible [3]. For future power grids an understanding of how to design robust dynamics is required.

To understand which structural features impact the self-organized synchronization mechanism, it has proven fruitful to take a probabilistic view. Probabilistic approaches are well established in the context of static power flow analysis [9]. In the dynamic context, considering the expected likelihood of failure given a non-linear, random perturbation effectively averages over the various contingencies. Such probabilities are thus well suited to reveal structural features that enhance the system robustness or vulnerability. This approach has been highly successful in identifying particularly vulnerable grid regions [10 –12] and revealing general mechanisms of desynchronization [13]. Probabilistic stability assessments recently got more attention in the engineering community as well [3, 14, 15]. Assessing probabilistic dynamic stability of a given class of power grid models is computationally ex- pensive. Further, the probabilistic dynamics are a sensitive function of the structural variables and mi- nor changes like the addition of a single power line may lead to very different outcomes (see e.g. [16]). Since the space of parameters that may influence the dynamic stability of a power grid is very large, an explicit computational assessment of all potential configurations is impossible. If graph neural networks (GNNs) were able to reliably predict probabilistic dynamic stability, they could be used to select promising candidate configurations for which a more detailed assessment should be carried out. Moreover, the analysis of the decision process of ML-models might lead to new unknown relations between dynamical properties and structural aspects, such as the grids topology or the distribution of loads and generators. Such insights may ultimately inform the design and development of power grids.
