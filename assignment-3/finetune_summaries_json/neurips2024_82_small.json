By collaborating with schools and engaging multidisciplinary experts and the young people themselves, we seek to co-create an impactful educational interven- tion. Starting with a comprehensive survey of school counsellors to map the current state of climate awareness and anxiety, and to understand their expectations for our AI solution, this project is poised for global scalability, addressing the pressing mental health challenges associated with climate change, particularly in vulnerable and resource-constrained regions. 1 Introduction and Related Work A significant proportion of children in the UK, specifically 70% of those aged 12–18 years, express concern about the world they will inherit due to climate change [ 17]. In a study spanning ten countries—including Australia, Brazil, Finland, France, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Portugal, the UK, and the USA—84% of young people aged 16–25 reported being worried about climate change [ 10]. The intersection of climate awareness and related worries has become increasingly prominent, particularly among young people who are simultaneously confronted with the realities of environmental crises and the perception of inadequate action by authorities [ 1]. This dual burden often manifests as climate anxiety, characterised by pervasive stress, fear, and a sense of hopelessness [ 10]. As young individuals become more informed about the dire consequences of climate change, their mental health is increasingly at risk, necessitating the development of effective coping mechanisms. The discourse surrounding climate anxiety underscores the critical need for community involvement, informed activism, and specialised therapeutic interventions to mitigate the psychological toll of climate-related stress [5, 1, 10]. Recent studies reveal that personal experiences with global warming are significantly shaping public concern, particularly among younger demographics [ 5]. The Handbook of Climate Psychology delves into these psychological impacts, offering strategies to manage the emotional responses triggered by climate change [ 1]. Additionally, research published in The Lancet highlights the prevalence of climate anxiety, especially among youth, and calls for targeted mental health interventions to address this growing concern [ 10]. Several resources have explored the psychological dimensions of climate anxiety, emphasising the urgent need for both individual and systemic solutions. For instance, Yale Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.experts have explained how climate anxiety functions as a multifaceted response to the perceived threat of climate change, advocating for community engagement and active involvement in climate action as effective coping strategies [ 18]. Similarly, psychologists have researched the prevalence of climate anxiety across various demographics, suggesting that both individual coping mechanisms and broader systemic changes are necessary to address the underlying causes of climate-related stress [ 6].Mental Health UK offers practical advice for managing climate anxiety, including the importance of staying informed, participating in environmental activism, and seeking professional support when necessary [ 20]. Furthermore, the Harvard Health Blog discusses the link between climate change and anxiety-related sleep disturbances, proposing management tips that include proactive environmental engagement and maintaining a healthy lifestyle [ 3]. The Natural History Museum has also contributed by suggesting eco-therapy and community support as strategies for dealing with eco-anxiety, reinforcing the therapeutic benefits of nature and active participation in environmental solutions [ 15]. Technological solutions, such as climate chatbots, as evidenced by platforms such as BBC Climate News [ 2] and ChatNetZero [ 4], have also been designed to offer information and demystify concepts related to climate change. The Earkick chatbot [ 7], a mental health AI assistant, also focus on mental health interventions for climate anxiety. While these tools provide valuable insights, they are predominantly designed for adult users or a general audience, leaving a substantial gap in addressing the unique needs of children and adolescents, who are disproportionately affected by climate anxiety [ 13]. There is an urgent need to develop solutions specifically tailored to young individuals grappling with the psychological impacts of climate change, as their well-being is crucial for the future of our society. The integration of large language models (LLMs) into chatbots offers a promising avenue for achieving this goal, which are currently being developed to support queer youth [ 14], monitor digital wellbeing [ 8], and adolescent cyberbullying education [ 9]. When developed responsibly, LLM-based chatbots have the potential to deliver natural, empathetic interactions at scale, providing personalised support to youth and helping them navigate their anxiety in a way that feels both authentic and accessible. By harnessing the power of these advanced technologies, we aim to create a new set of tools that not only address the mental health challenges posed by climate change but also empower young people to take informed, responsible actions for a sustainable future. Through strategic partnerships with schools, we aim to seamlessly integrate our initiative into existing educational frameworks, starting with a comprehensive survey of school counsellors in the Global North to assess the current state of climate awareness and anxiety among students, and to understand their expectations for our AI solution.
