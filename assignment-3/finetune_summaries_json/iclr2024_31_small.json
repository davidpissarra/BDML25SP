ETS prices stayed low for a long time but finally started to rise in 2017. The ETS allowance prices skyrocketed in 2021, reaching almost €100 in February 2022. Nevertheless, prices dropped below €60 in early-March after the disruptions caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Our contribution to the literature on carbon pricing is twofold. First, we propose a new EU Climate Change News Index (ECCNI) that tracks the ongoing discussion in the EU about climate change using global media sources. Although some articles have already incorpo- rated news information into the forecasting of ETS prices (Ye and Xue, 2021; Zhang and Xia, 2022), no meaningful feature has been created that captures the media’s climate policy- related discussions. We apply term frequency–inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) feature extraction to the GDELT1news database to measure the frequency of climate change-related keywords in the news associated with the EU. The TF-IDF features help to quantify the intensity of the discussion about climate change in the EU and to incorporate policy context in the analysis of carbon prices. Second, we apply the news index to predict the next day’s ETS allowance price returns. We test the forecast accuracy of the ECCNI against a set of control variables taken from the literature. Our results suggest that the occurrence of climate change-related keywords in the most reliable news sites improves the forecasts of the ETS prices. Several quantitative methods have already been developed in academic literature to fore- cast carbon prices. Zhao et al. Zhao et al. (2018) categorizes these papers into two groups: (1) forecasting based on time-series data using carbon price only; (2) extending with eco- nomic and energy data too. The carbon price-only methods mostly include ARIMA models; however, they can only capture linear relationships (Zhu and Chevallier, 2017). Therefore, more advanced frameworks have been applied to carbon prices, like different varieties of generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models (Arouri et al., 2012; Benschopa and L´ opez Cabreraa, 2014; Byun and Cho, 2013) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models (Arouri et al., 2012). Nevertheless, carbon price-only methods do not incorporate all available information in the market. Various articles that aim to forecast carbon prices use economic and energy-related variables proxying the demand for CO 2allowances (Arouri et al., 2012; Gu ðbrandsd´ ottir and Haraldsson, 2011; Zhao et al., 2018). Recently, alternative predictors, e.g., news data through natural language processing (NLP), have also been used to forecast ETS prices (Ye and Xue, 2021; Zhang and Xia, 2022). However, they only included the headlines and titles of online news from limited sources and consequently could only examine carbon prices with a weekly frequency. To shed more light on the impact of news on daily ETS prices, we create features by applying the TF-IDF method to the GDELT news dataset.
