RL offers capabilities to enhance these parameterisation schemes, including direct interaction, handling sparse or delayed feedback, continuous online learning, and long-term optimisation. We evaluate the performance of eight RL algorithms on two idealised environments: one for temperature bias correction, another for radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) imitating real-world computational constraints. Results show different RL approaches excel in different climate scenarios with exploration algorithms performing better in bias correction, while exploitation algorithms proving more effective for RCE.

The UK has experienced an increase in extreme weather events, with the 10 warmest years on record occurring since 2003 [ 1]. These events have caused significant disruptions, exemplified by the 2019-20 UK floods [ 2] resulting in economic losses of at least £333 million [ 3]. Accurate forecasting and climate projections are essential for various sectors, underscoring their importance in national resilience and economic stability. Traditionally, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) methods have been utilised in weather and climate models, solving equations governing atmospheric dynamics to generate forecasts. Notable examples include the Met Office’s Unified Model [4] and the ECMWF’s Integrated Forecast System [5]. While NWP models have improved forecast accuracy since their introduction in 1952 [ 6], they still face limitations in representing sub-grid scale processes and resolving intricate atmospheric phenomena [7]. Although recent advancements in machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated strong potential in outperforming NWP models in short to medium-range weather forecasting [ 8–20], purely data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches face inherent limitations in abiding by fundamental laws of physics and thermodynamic principles [ 21,22], and in generalising to out-of- distribution scenarios [ 23,24]. ML models also can produce outputs that violate key constraints like conservation laws of mass and energy [ 25,26], often requiring additional constraints to circumvent Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", NeurIPS 2024arXiv:2408.16118v2  [cs.LG]  10 Oct 2024such violations [ 27–29]. In long range climate projections, these violations can trigger instabilities and escalating errors, leading to rapid degradation of forecast skill beyond shorter lead times [30]. To address these issues, our research explores the implementation of a reinforcement learning (RL) assisted climate modelling framework. RL algorithms learn by interacting with an environment, iteratively adjusting their behaviour to maximise a cumulative future reward signal. By formulating the climate model parameterisation problem as a control task, RL agents can learn to dynamically adjust the parameters of low resolution NWP models as a function of the atmospheric state, respecting the physics by leaving the structure of the physical parametrisations intact. For this research, we adopt a step-wise approach, first using RL for climate bias correction in a simple heating environment, then extending our methods to a climlab [ 31] based setup of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE). In particular, this research advances the field of AI-based atmospheric modelling through the following key contributions: 1.Novel application of RL in climate modelling : We explore the use of continuous action model-free RL algorithms (REINFORCE [ 32], DDPG [ 33], DPG [ 34], TD3 [ 35], PPO [ 36], TRPO [ 37], SAC [ 38], TQC [ 39]) to dynamically adjust parameters in climate models, offering a new approach to the long-standing challenge of parameterisation in NWP systems. 2.Integration of physical constraints : Our framework demonstrates how RL can be em- ployed to optimise model performance while adhering to fundamental physical constraints, addressing a critical limitation of purely data-driven approaches. 2 Methodology 2.1 Background 2.1.1 Advantages over traditional ML models RL offers three key advantages that are beneficial for improving model parameterisations in the climate context: 1.Continuous incremental learning : RL algorithms can continuously adapt and update their policies through direct interaction with the climate model environment, unlike traditional static ML techniques that rely on fixed training datasets.
