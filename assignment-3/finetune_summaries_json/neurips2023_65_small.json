At the same time, ocean processes affect phenomena such as hurricanes and droughts. Parameters in the models that cannot be physically measured have a significant effect on the model output. For an idealized ocean model, we generated perturbed parameter ensemble data and trained surrogate neural network models. The neural surrogates accurately predicted the one-step forward dynamics, of which we then computed the parametric sensitivity. 1 Introduction The oceans act as an important brake on anthropogenic climate change by absorbing carbon dioxide and atmospheric heat. At the same time, ocean processes play an important role in phenomena such as hurricanes and droughts. Much effort is devoted to modeling and understanding the behavior of the ocean under various scenarios [ 1–3]. Of particular interest are the long-term changes in critical ocean circulation patterns such as the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), which could have wide-ranging climate impacts. The AMOC is responsible for the northward heat transport throughout the entire Atlantic Ocean and is therefore an important process to accurately represent in Earth system models. Understanding the stability of this circulation is critical to our ability to predict the conditions that could cause a collapse in AMOC. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.We are interested in understanding the sensitivities of an ocean model’s output to the model parameters. Estimating this sensitivity is very time-consuming by brute force. Alternatively, adjoints have shown great promise in uncovering the sensitivity of the model to its parameters [ 4,5]. Yet, adjoints are very time consuming to develop manually and very involved to develop via automatic differentiation (AD) for some models. Because neural networks (NN) implemented in deep learning frameworks can be differentiated trivially, we have explored how to generate an accurate NN surrogate for an ocean model. We have considered the Simulating Ocean Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) test case for the MPAS-Ocean model and built neural network surrogates of the forward dynamics. The contributions of this work can be summarized as follows. (1) We created a SOMA perturbed parameter ensemble dataset for deep learning model development and benchmarking; (2) We employed three different strategies to train neural network surrogates with large-scale distributed training, aiming to recreate the timestepping behavior of the forward (true) model. The trained models also showed consistent rollout performance for the midrange horizon; (3) we computed neural adjoints from the trained models and gained insight into the sensitivity to the varying Gent-McWilliams (GM) [6] parametrization. 2 SOMA Test Case The Simulating Ocean Mesoscale Activity (SOMA) experiment [ 7] is a simulation within the Model for Prediction across Scales Ocean (MPAS-O) [ 8–10]. SOMA simulates an eddying midlatitude ocean basin (for details see Appendix C) with latitudes ranging from 21.58 to 48.58N and longitudes ranging from 16.58W to 16.58E. The basin is circular and features curved coastlines with a 150-km-wide, 100-m-deep continental shelf. SOMA is a more realistic version of typical double-gyre test cases, which are commonly used to assess idealized ocean model behavior. We have chosen to estimate the isopycnal surface of the ocean at 32-km resolution. This diagnostic output is computed from five prognostic outputs that in turn are influenced by four model parameters. The original SOMA simulation runs for constant values of the scalar parameters that are being studied. For each parameter, a range was derived from the literature on reasonable values (for details see Appendix C). 1000 samples within the range were drawn to form an ensemble. Each forward run involves using a parameter value from the sample, while using default values for the rest. For each perturbed parameter run, the model is run for 2 years without recording any data. Then the model is run forward for one year, while recording the output at one-day intervals. 3 Neural Network Surrogates Model Description On a high level, SOMA starts with the initial states, x0, and the preset model parameters, p, and solves for the state variables at time t.
