They are issued on time scales of weeks to months and differ from short-term weather forecasts in two important ways: (i) the dynamics of the atmosphere on these timescales can be described only statistically and (ii) these dynamics are characterized by large-scale phenomena in both space and time. While deep learning (DL) has shown promising results in short-term weather forecasting, DL-based S2S forecasts are challenged by comparatively small volumes of available training data and large fluctuations in predictability due to atmospheric conditions. In order to develop more reliable S2S predictions that leverage current advances in DL, we propose to utilize the masked auto-encoder (MAE) framework to learn generic representations of large-scale atmospheric phenomena from high resolution global data. Besides exploring the suitability of the learned representations for S2S forecasting, we will also examine whether they account for climatic phenomena (e.g., the Madden-Julian Oscillation) that are known to increase predictability on S2S timescales. 1 I NTRODUCTION Goal We aim to implement a self-supervised deep learning pipeline ( 50) that facilitates the encoding and anticipation of large-scale atmospheric patterns including, but not limited to, the Madden Julian Oscillation ( 51) and the Silk Road pattern ( 6), which are well-suited for the generation of explainable S2S forecasts (34). Potential impacts Extreme weather events are likely to increase in magnitude and frequency under ongoing global climate change ( 37), in part due to seasonal weather dynamics, which are also anticipated to intensify in the future ( 19). Reliable S2S forecasts ( 48;43) can limit the impact of future extreme events by informing decision-makers and stakeholders well in advance, allowing time for appropriate mitigating measures to be adopted. The development of improved S2S forecasting systems is, in fact, a vital part of climate change impact mitigation ( 1;2), and our approach, if successful, can potentially help stakeholders in agriculture, energy management, and disaster mitigation (28). Climate background How one forecasts atmospheric dynamics depends mainly on the timescale of interest. Forecasts up to approximately two weeks can be achieved by deterministic forward simulation from initial conditions ( 26) and have been refined to impressive levels of accuracy ( 4). 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2023 More recently, DL-based methods have produced forecasts on these timescales that rival or even surpass the quality of physics-based numerical methods ( 29;5). Longer timescales ranging from several weeks to months and beyond, however, can not be addressed in the same fashion because the chaotic behaviour of the atmosphere imposes an inherent limit on deterministic forecasts ( 31). Instead, the long-term behavior of the atmosphere needs to be described in statistical terms ( 20), as is done in probabilistic or ensemble-based forecasts. The complex interplay of atmospheric and oceanic processes ( 18), however, leads to large variations in possible forecast horizons and associated uncertainties. Identifying conditions which allow skillful forecasts, known as windows of opportunity (34), is a key challenge for S2S forecasting. Typical windows of opportunity often stem from large-scale modes of climatic variability, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO ( 33;32)), the Northern Atlantic Oscillation (NAO ( 24)), and the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which have intra- to inter-annual periodicities that an S2S forecast system would seek to utilize. Here, we consider the MJO, an oscillating convective system that moves eastward along the equator and has a period of approximately 40—60 days ( 51). The intensity and location of the MJO are closely related to the occurrence of extreme rainfall events over India, the Maritime Continent, and South Asia ( 40). Moreover, these large-scale patterns are known to offer a window of opportunity for S2S forecasts over Europe, Australia, and North America (34). State-of-the-art and challenges Previous work on S2S forecasts utilizing DL has focused on global temperature and precipitation ( 44), the occurrence of heatwaves ( 30;25;11), or climate indices like the MJO index ( 13) and the Nino 3.4 index ( 9). Major obstacles when training DL models for S2S tasks are the comparatively small number of available observations of S2S phenomena and the intermittency of their predictability. The latter is not accounted for in standard DL tasks, which means that, for a fixed lead time, all model errors will be treated the same, regardless whether skillful forecasts were feasible or not, which may harm convergence ( 35). Mainly due to these issues, current S2S-DL models are small (for DL standards\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
