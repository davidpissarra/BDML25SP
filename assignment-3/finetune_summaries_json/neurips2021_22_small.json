Models such as FARSITE and BehavePlus are 35 widely adopted in commercial and government work today but typically focus on improving select 36 parameters, with incremental progress in each new generation [9,10]. But the reality in the words of 37 Rothermel pupil Brett Butler, is that \"(these models describe) very well a ﬁre burning in a ﬁeld of 38 wheat. As you get further away from that uniformity, the less accurate (they) become [11].\" 39 Among the most meaningful areas of such progress has been the improvement of topographic wind 40 speed modeling. Because most wildﬁres do not burn in a ﬁeld of wheat, understanding how wind 41 changes speed in complex topography is important to assessing speed and direction of ﬁre spread. 42 Wagenbrenner et al.
