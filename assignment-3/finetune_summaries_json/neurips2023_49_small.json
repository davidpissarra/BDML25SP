Wilson ISAE-SUPAERO, University of Toulouse dennis.wilson@isae-supaero.fr Abstract Coastal zones are under increasing pressures due to climate change and the increas- ing population densities in coastal areas around the globe. Our ability to accurately forecast the evolution of the coastal zone is of critical importance to coastal man- agers in the context of risk assessment and mitigation. Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence and remote sensing enable the development of automatic large-scale analysis methodologies based on observation data. In this work, we make use of a novel satellite-derived shoreline forecasting dataset and two variants of the com- mon Encoder-Decoder neural network, UNet, in order to predict shoreline change based on spatio-temporal information. We analyze the importance of including the spatial context at the prediction step and we ﬁnd that it greatly enhances model performance. Overall, the UNet and UNetLSTM models presented here achieve signiﬁcant global forecast correlation scores of 0.66 and 0.77, respectively. 1 Introduction Coastal zones around the globe are facing increased natural and anthropogenic pressures, and our knowledge of their evolution is critical in many scenarios, including coastal risk assessment and mitigation. Shoreline evolution forecasting is an important element in coastal science which aims at improving our understanding of, and ability to predict, the occurrence and intensity of coastal erosion and its potential impacts on the coast [ 1,2]. Much of our current knowledge of coastal evolution originates from the study of a few well-documented coastal sites where frequent ﬁeld surveys have Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.been ongoing for multiple years. However, due to the high cost of in-situ ﬁeld surveys, the state and evolution of these systems is not known in many areas of the world [3]. Space-borne Earth Observation missions create the potential for studying coastal systems at a global scale and at high temporal frequencies (up-to daily), but present new technical challenges and require the development of new methodologies for information extraction and processing. Machine Learning (ML) is a family of Artiﬁcial Intelligence algorithms that aim at automatically approximating the relations between inputs and outputs, by maximizing (or minimizing) an objective function over a labelled dataset of training samples. Recent developments in ML have led to signiﬁcant advancements in a number of scientiﬁc domains [ 4–11]. Due to the continuous stream of high-dimensional data recorded by multiple EO satellite constellations, ML has seen a wide adoption in RS data processing pipelines, and has been used to augment or completely replace existing image and signal processing- based analysis [12–16]. A large body of work exists in the Coastal Science literature on shoreline forecasting, ranging from physics-based approaches such as process-based morphological models and hybrid shoreline models, to a wide range of data-driven techniques. Deep learning-based models are often found competitive with physics-based and traditional forecasting techniques [ 1,17,18], and offer a number of desirable properties in the context of large-scale shoreline analysis [ 3,19]. However, training accurate DL models requires the availability of representative training data which would allow the models to generalize to previously-unseen conditions [ 20]. In this work, we make use of a novel global-scale dataset of satellite-derived shorelines, and their corresponding shoreline change drivers, in order to train and test a spatio-temporal approach to predicting shoreline change based on Deep Learning. Here, an Encoder-Decoder convolutional neural network (UNet) is extended to include a temporal unit (LSTM) in order to learn the spatio-temporal patterns in shoreline forcing and shoreline response. To our knowledge, this work presents the ﬁrst steps towards a data-driven method for global shoreline prediction based on spatio-temporal data. 2 Global shorelines dataset This study makes use of a satellite-derived dataset of global monthly shoreline position time series dataset that spans '25 years (1994 to 2019) and covers 6841 coastal points around the globe; in addition to global datasets of shoreline change drivers including coastal waves, sea level anomaly, and regional river discharge. This dataset was presented in [21]. The methodology followed to derive shoreline positions from satellite imagery makes use of Normal Difference Water Index (NDWI) maps in order to segment satellite imagery into land and sea surfaces. Using a NDWI threshold of 0.5, pixels of a single satellite image can be divided into land and sea pixels. The coastline position is then identiﬁed as the interface between land and sea. In order to create a time series of global coastline evolution, the Google Earth Engine was used to process a large amount of satellite data from the Landsat 5, 7 and 8 missions. The extracted shorelines are aggregated to a monthly scale using the monthly median shoreline position. Multiple techniques were used to derive the shoreline change drivers time series.
