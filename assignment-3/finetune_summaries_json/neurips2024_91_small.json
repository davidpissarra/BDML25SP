Such enhanced PINNs can allow us to accelerate high-fidelity simulations needed to ensure a stable and reliable renewables-rich future grid. 1 Introduction and motivation Rapid decarbonization of power systems is crucial to reducing emissions and enabling clean elec- trification in other sectors like transportation and industry. This entails a transition away from conventional fossil fuel-based power generation (coal and natural) towards renewables like wind, solar, and batteries. Centralized thermal generators consist of large, rotating synchronous machines with high inertia that help resolve imbalances between power demand and supply to stabilize grid frequency. However, renewable resources and battery storage are largely connected to the grid via inverters based on power electronics with much faster dynamics and have little to no inertia. This introduces reliability and stability challenges for the future grid [ 1]. Thus, it is essential to be able to accurately study the dynamics of such inverter-based resources (IBRs), along with those of conventional synchronous generators (SGs) which will also continue playing an important role in complementing renewables for the next few decades. This is especially critical during disturbances like faults, outages of lines or generators, and sudden drops in renewables output (e.g. due to cloud cover on solar or wind lulls). Analyzing power system dynamics and transient stability involves solving several nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs), often at very fine resolutions rang- ing from a few milliseconds to microseconds. These can be expensive to solve using traditional numerical integration, especially for smaller time steps. Furthermore, unlike the relatively small number of centralized power plants today, the increasing penetration of distributed energy resources in the future will significantly increase the number of devices that need to be studied. This motivates the need for more scalable and computationally efficient tools to predict power system dynamics. Scientific machine learning (SciML) based on physics-informed neural networks is a promising data-driven approach to increase the speed of dynamic simulations while still maintaining high accuracy [ 2,3]. This will allow us to accelerate high-fidelity studies of large signal stability of bulk power systems with current-constrained IBRs. Such tools are crucial to accelerate decarbonization while also ensuring a stable and reliable future grid. ∗Work done as part of a research internship at X, the moonshot factory (formerly Google X). Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.1.1 Prior work and contributions A few works in the literature have explored applications of PINNs for power and energy systems [ 4] to directly predict the solutions of nonlinear ODEs. In particular, these have been used to study the dynamics of power systems. Most of these studies have focused on the dynamics of SGs [ 5,6]. To our knowledge, only one work so far has considered PINN applications for inverters [ 7]. However, these studies have generally used simplified, relatively low-order, and low-dimensional models. For example, SGs have been studied using the classical, second-order swing equation [ 8] or other reduced-order models [ 9]. The inverter studies have focused solely on studying one component, i.e. the phase-locked loop (PLL) converter (which synchronizes the inverter with the grid) by converting the simplified second-order dynamics to an equivalent swing equation with two states. In this work, we aim to build upon existing works and apply PINNs to more complex, higher-order, and higher- dimensional ODE models. In particular, we study a fourth-order SG model with four states and for the inverter, we develop a PINN that models all the components of the inverter (including multiple controllers, converters, and filters) as a whole with the goal of predicting 17 states in total. This increased complexity introduces numerous new challenges for training the PINN and improving its generalization. We provide a comprehensive overview of these difficulties from our experiments as well as observations from prior works. We then attempt to address some of these by proposing some novel enhancements and also by implementing several other ideas from the PINN and broader SciML literature that have not yet been employed in the power systems domain. 2 Methodology 2.1 Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) PINNs are a class of neural networks that aim to directly learn the solutions of differential equations. This is primarily achieved by cleverly designing the loss function during training. Consider the following initial value problem (IVP) with system states x, inputs u, and initial conditions (ICs) x0. We would like to approximate the solution ˆx(t)using a neural network fNNparametrized by θ, i.e. the weights and biases. ˙x=f(x, t,u),x(0) = x0,ˆx(t) =fNN(x0, t, uθ) (1) We train the PINN by minimizing a weighted combination of two types of losses: (i) Licthat enforces the ICs, and (ii) the ODE residual Lodethat enforces\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
