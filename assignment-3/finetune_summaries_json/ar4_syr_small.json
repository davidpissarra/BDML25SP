This approach is used by WG III through a series of self-e xplanatory terms such as:  high agreement, much evidence;  high agreement, medium evidence; medium agreement, medium evidence; etc. Where uncertainty is assessed more quantitatively using expert judgement of the correctness of underlying data, models or analy ses, then the following scale of confidence levels is used to express the assessed chance of a finding being correct: v ery high confidence  at least 9 out of 10; high confidence  about 8 out of 10;  medium confidence  about 5 out of 10;  low confidence  about 2 out of 10; and  very low confidence  less than 1 out of 10.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nThe Synthesis Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was adopted at the IPCC Plenary XXVII (Valencia, Spain, 12-17 November 2007). This report represents the formally agreed statement of the IPCC concerning key findings and uncertainties contained in the Working Group contributions to the Fourth Assessment Report.\n\nThe Synthesis Report is based on the assessment carried out by the three Working Groups (WGs) of the IPCC. It provides an integrated view of climate change as the final part of the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). The report is divided into six topics:\n\nTopic 1 summarizes observed changes in climate and their effects on natural and human systems, regardless of their causes.\n\nTopic 2 assesses the causes of the observed changes.\n\nTopic 3 presents projections of future climate change and related impacts under different scenarios.\n\nTopic 4 discusses adaptation and mitigation options over the next few decades and their interactions with sustainable development.\n\nTopic 5 assesses the relationship between adaptation and mitigation on a more conceptual basis and takes a longer-term perspective.\n\nTopic 6 summarizes the major robust findings and remaining key uncertainties in this assessment.\n\nA schematic framework representing anthropogenic drivers, impacts of, and responses to climate change, and their linkages is shown in Figure I.1.\n\nAt the time of the Third Assessment Report (TAR) in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages in one direction, i.e., to derive climatic changes and impacts from socio-economic information and emissions. With increased understanding of these linkages, it is now possible to assess the linkages in both directions, i.e., to evaluate possible development pathways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid.\n\nThe IPCC uncertainty guidance note defines a framework for the treatment of uncertainties across all WGs and in this Synthesis Report.
