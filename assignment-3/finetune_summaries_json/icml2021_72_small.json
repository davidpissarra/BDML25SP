Introduction In recent years, there has been an unusually extensive wild- ﬁre activity all over the world. Forest ﬁres raged across California in 2017, 2018 and 2020, Australia faced unprece- dented bushﬁres in 2019-2020, and even Siberia was hit by wildﬁres in 2019 and 2020. Events like these cause a direct loss of life, with for instance 100 fatalities during the 2018 California wildﬁres and wildﬁre-induced respiratory prob- lems causing premature deaths in large parts of the world (Reid et al., 2016; Porter et al., 2019; Matz et al., 2020). In addition, wildﬁres lead to signiﬁcant economic damages and costs for ﬁre suppression (Strader, 2018; Goss et al., 2020). While regular-sized wildﬁres sustain biodiversity and ecosystem health, megaﬁres have clear adverse effects 1Hydrology and Hydraulic Engineering, Vrije Uni- versiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium2\b-lab, Euro- pean Space Agency, Frascati, Italy.

Dur- ing the 2019-2020 Australian bushﬁres, an estimated one billion animals were killed, while hundreds of Australian plant and animal species now face extinction (DAWE, 2020; Filkov et al., 2020; Wintle et al., 2020). Evaluating the imprint of human activity on climatic vari- ables and impacts is done via the application of detection and attribution methodologies (Field et al., 2014). Detec- tion refers to the process of demonstrating that climate or a system affected by climate has changes in a deﬁned sta- tistical sense, whereas attribution implies the evaluation of relative contributions of multiple causal factors to this change given a speciﬁc statistical conﬁdence (Field et al., 2014). Instead of looking at wildﬁre impacts, like burned area, most wildﬁre detection and attribution studies have traditionally been limited to atmospheric variables, whereby most build on a version of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) (Bindoff et al., 2013; Gudmundsson et al., 2014; Krikken et al., 2019; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019; Abatzoglou et al., 2019; van Oldenborgh et al., 2020). The motivation behind the choice of atmospheric variables is that wildﬁre activity is partly determined by local weather i.e., prolonged periods of dry, hot weather increase the fre- quency and severity of wildﬁre activity. However, wildﬁre activity is actually inﬂuenced by a wide range of drivers, including, but not limited to, weather, topography, vegeta- tion type and density, and ﬁreﬁghting measures (Turco et al., 2014; Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016; Goss et al., 2020; Podschwit & Cullen, 2020). Therefore, a more appropriate tool for capturing on-the-ground impacts of wildﬁres and for investigating the changes in their activity has been re- cently proposed: the measure of burned area (Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016; Andela et al., 2017). Despite its relevance for representing wildﬁre impacts, burned area is much more complex to model compared to ﬁre weather indices, due to all the confounding factors inﬂuencing burned area.

Forest fires raged across California in 2017, 2018, and 2020, Australia faced unprecedented bushfires in 2019-2020, and even Siberia was hit by wildfires in 2019 and 2020. Events like these cause direct loss of life, with, for instance, 100 fatalities during the 2018 California wildfires and wildfire-induced respiratory problems causing premature deaths in large parts of the world (Reid et al., 2016; Porter et al., 2019; Matz et al., 2020). In addition, wildfires lead to significant economic damages and costs for fire suppression (Strader, 2018; Goss et al., 2020). While regular-sized wildfires sustain biodiversity and ecosystem health, megafires have clear adverse effects on ecosystems and biodiversity (Driscoll et al., 2010; North et al., 2015; Doerr & Santín, 2016; Andela et al., 2017). During the 2019-2020 Australian bushfires, an estimated one billion animals were killed, while hundreds of Australian plant and animal species now face extinction (DAWE, 2020; Filkov et al., 2020; Wintle et al., 2020).\n\nEvaluating the impact of human activity on climatic variables and impacts is done via the application of detection and attribution methodologies (Field et al., 2014).

Most wildfire detection and attribution studies have traditionally been limited to atmospheric variables, using a version of the Fire Weather Index (FWI) (Bindoff et al., 2013; Gudmundsson et al., 2014; Krikken et al., 2019; Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2019; Abatzoglou et al., 2019; van Oldenborgh et al., 2020). However, wildfire activity is influenced by a wide range of drivers, including weather, topography, vegetation type and density, and firefighting measures (Turco et al., 2014; Abatzoglou & Williams, 2016; Goss et al., 2020; Podschwit & Cullen, 2020).
