    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe sliced Wasserstein metric is a filtering technique that is conceptually interesting for MLOps pipelines in critical sectors, such as energy, as it offers a conservative data selection. We present a first dataset showcasing localized critical peak rebate demand response in a northern climate. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method on synthetic datasets and standard AD datasets and use it in the making of a first benchmark for our open-source localized critical peak rebate dataset.\n\nIntroduction\nQuébec, Canada, stands as an outlier in the electrical grid decarbonization paradigm. While there is a global tendency to invest in intermittent renewable energy sources to decarbonize grids worldwide, Québec, while not entirely strange to this trend, is generally mostly carbon-free thanks to its impressive hydroelectric power capacity. One of its main challenges comes from its northern climate, its reliance on electric baseboard heating systems for residential heating, and its unrestrictive home insulation policies. During glacial winter days, as electric heaters are all running at once, peak consumption hours hit, Québec's hydropower capacity can be reached. To accommodate winter peak power needs, Hydro-Québec, the state-owned company in charge of electric power generation, transmission, and distribution, must operate its only on-grid thermal power plant and import electricity from neighboring provinces and states. These imports are usually expensive and produce much more greenhouse gas emissions in comparison to local energy sources.\n\nTo remediate this issue without solely relying on the deployment of new generation and transmission infrastructures, demand response (DR) initiatives have flourished in the province. Demand response can be defined as changes in normal electrical power consumption patterns by end-use customers in response to a signal, such as financial incentives or control set points. With Québec's long tradition of fixed electricity rates, one of its main DR mechanisms is critical peak rebates (CPR). Residential customers enrolled in a CPR program receive financial compensation during pre-specified time periods, referred to as challenges, for reducing their energy consumption with respect to their expected baseload. CPR programs are purely voluntary and virtually penalty-free. They thus depend on consumers' goodwill, motivation, and sensitivity.\n\nWe work with a variation of CPR, known as localized CPR (LCPR), in which the events are called for localized relief in the grid instead of being cast for the whole system. LCPR can diversify the types of services offered by typical CPR programs, such as alleviating stress on local equipment like substation transformers or being paired with generation forecasts of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as roof solar panels and private wind farms, to balance demand and generation during peak hours. LCPR is highly underexplored in the literature and is a valuable application to benchmark trustworthy machine learning (ML) models.\n\nIndeed, the higher spatial granularity, the critical aspect of the task, the dependence on behavioral tendencies, and the lower margin for error require the deployment of forecasting models that offer performance guarantees, robustness to noise, interpretability, physical constraints satisfaction, a sense of prediction confidence, or a combination of them. Being able to predict and utilize localized peak-shaving potential in the electrical grid, through programs similar to LCPR, could accelerate the integration of DERs and, specifically for Québec, phase out its dependence on fossil energy-based imports.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, no published open-source datasets are showcasing either LCPR or CPR schemes, in a northern climate. As with most smart grid applications, dataset quality can highly influence the performance of ML models when used for training. The adversarial properties stemming from the amalgam of numerical errors, noise in sensor readings, telemetry issues, meter outages, and unusual extreme events can disrupt the prediction quality of ML models. Anomaly detection (AD) and outlier filtering are thus primordial in a reliable ML pipeline. Unsupervised AD methods are preferable as they do not need human-made labels and their hyperparameters can be tuned simultaneously with other ML models included in the loop.\n\nPopular unsupervised AD methods include local outlier factor (LOF), isolation forest, k-nearest neighbors (KNN), connectivity-based outlier factor, and one-class support vector machine (SVM)."
