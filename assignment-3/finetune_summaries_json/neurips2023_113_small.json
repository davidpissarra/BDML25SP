However, urban trees are often affected by abiotic and biotic stressors that hamper their functionality, and when- ever not timely managed, even their survival. The current visual or instrumented inspection techniques often require a high amount of human labor making frequent assessments infeasible at a city-wide scale. In this work, we present the GreenScan Project, a ground-based sensing system designed to provide health assessment of urban trees at high space-time resolutions, with low costs. The system utilises thermal and multi-spectral imaging sensors, fused using computer vision models to estimate two tree health indexes, namely NDVI and CTD. Preliminary evaluation of the system was performed through data collection experiments in Cambridge, USA. Overall, this work illustrates the potential of autonomous mobile ground-based tree health monitoring on city-wide scales at high temporal resolutions with low-costs. 1 Introduction In urban cities, the tree canopies and vegetation provide a wide range of ecosystem services such as air filtering, carbon sequestration, reduced energy consumption, and decreased local temperatures [1,2]. However, urban trees are experiencing an ample amount of abiotic stressors such as the urban heat island (UHI) effect, and biotic stressors, such as insects and bacteria attacks that are exacerbated due to climate change [ 3,4,5]. As a result, their functionality, productivity, and survival are of increasing concern [6]. Currently, the health of trees can be inspected by arborists (a tree doctor) with good quality results, but at high costs due to the amount of human labor involved [ 7]. Therefore, leading to an assessment Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.that has a low temporal resolution (e.g. once every 2-5 years). Satellite-based imaging can cover large areas although at a low spatial granularity (depending on the type of sensor) [ 8], with data quality influenced by external factors such as the availability of clear skies [ 8], and constrained temporal resolutions except in cases of targeted acquisitions [ 9]. Airborne sensing using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UA Vs) or airplanes leads to an increased spatial granularity [ 8], yet it may not be suitable in highly urbanized environments due to aviation authority regulations. Further, depending on the canopy density, both airborne sensing and satellite imagery usually capture the overhead view of the urban canopy. As a result, vegetation elements such as green walls, short trees, or shrubs present underneath the tree canopy may be missed [ 10] or misinterpreted [ 11]. These challenges make it infeasible for governments and municipalities to perform frequent health quality inspections of urban greenery at large scales. As a result, adverse health conditions are often discovered only after severe damage, and sometimes, beyond the point of no return. Further, given the lack of tree health data, intricate relationships of urban trees with other micro-scale ecosystem services is not well understood from an urban planning perspective. In recent years, a number of projects have investigated the use of low-cost technological alternatives to monitor various environmental parameters in cities. For instance, applying computer vision methods on Google Street View (GSV) images to detect the presence of trees [ 12,13], or using drive-by sensing strategies to measure air pollution and other urban morphology parameters [ 14]. Drive-by sensing approaches enable collecting data at both higher temporal and spatial resolutions [15] compared to manual inspection approaches, embedded sensors, or satellite-based sensing. A subset of these works, set within the domain of opportunistic sensing are developing platforms that can be deployed and operated without the need of a dedicated infrastructure. Following on this trend and the critical need for protecting and managing urban trees, in this work, we investigate the monitoring of the health of urban trees, terrestrially, at high spatio-temporal resolutions with low costs. The work described as the GreenScan Project, measures the health of urban trees on a city-wide scale using complementary indexes that represents a tree’s photosynthetic capacity and a tree’s water stress levels. The system fuses data from low-cost thermal and multispectral imaging sensors using custom computer vision models to generate two popular health indexes namely NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) and CTD (Canopy Temperature Depression). NDVI is based on the optical properties of chlorophyll and cell structure in the leaves [ 16], while CTD is physically related to the overall water stress of the trees (based on soil) [ 17]. A GreenScan system is suitable for deployment in a citizen-science paradigm by being carried by pedestrians and/or in a drive-by sensing paradigm by mounting on urban vehicles such as taxis, garbage trucks or bikes.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe Faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics, and Computer Science at Delft University of Technology, in collaboration with R.R. Venkatesha Prasad, has developed the GreenScan Project. This project aims to mitigate climate change by assessing the health of urban trees, which are essential for reducing extreme heat and air pollution. However, urban trees are often affected by abiotic and biotic stressors, such as the urban heat island effect, insects, and bacteria attacks, which can lead to reduced functionality, productivity, and survival.\n\nCurrent visual and instrumented inspection techniques require significant human labor, making frequent assessments infeasible at a city-wide scale. The GreenScan Project addresses this issue by developing a ground-based sensing system that provides high-resolution health assessments of urban trees at low costs. The system utilizes thermal and multi-spectral imaging sensors, combined with computer vision models, to estimate two tree health indexes: NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) and CTD (Canopy Temperature Depression).\n\nPreliminary evaluations of the system were conducted in Cambridge, USA, demonstrating the potential for autonomous mobile ground-based tree health monitoring at high temporal resolutions with low costs.
