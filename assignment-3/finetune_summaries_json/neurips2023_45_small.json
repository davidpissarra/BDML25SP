In this work we develop a fully-automatic pipeline based on Deep Learning to investigate the evolution of the glaciers in the Alps from 2015 to present (2023). After outlier filtering, we provide individual estimates for around 1300 glaciers, representing 87% of the glacierized area. Regionally we estimate an area loss of-1.8% a−1, with large variations between glaciers. Code and data are available athttps://github.com/dcodrut/glacier_mapping_alps_tccml. 1 Introduction Glaciers are critical components in the Earth system, and an essential water resource for both industrial and domestic use[1]. They act as a low-pass filter for high-frequency, inter-annual variability in weather, which makes them a valuable and sensitive climate change indicator on multi-annual timescales [2]. One of the observations for assessing glacier health is their area[3], which has been classified as an Essential Climate Variable (ECV) [4]. Glaciers in the European Alps experienced a large volume loss over the last two decades[5] and, as a consequence, they also retreated significantly (about -1.3% change in area per year), as shown by Paul et al. [6] in the latest inventory available for this region. There are more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide and methods requiring manual intervention are, therefore, extremely labour intensive[3]. Fully automated methods are, however, challenging for many reasons, e.g. cast shadow, local clouds, difficulties in distinguishing debris-covered segments from surrounding rocks or seasonal/perennial snow from glacier ice etc. [7]. As a consequence, significant variations can occur even within outlines manually delineated by experts[6]. Recently, there has been significant progress in developing fully-automated methods for glacier mapping, mainly based on Deep Learning approaches. Xie et al. [8] provides a comparison of multiple architectures, with DeepLabV3+[9] and GlacierNet[10] (an extended U-Net[11] architecture) achieving the best (IOU) scores. Baraka et al. [12] use also U-Net for the Hindu Kush Himalayan region and inicluded a web tool that can be used for visualizing and correcting the predictions. Here, we utilize a Deep Learning method with additional data processing steps in order to investigate the evolution of the glaciers in the Alps between 2015 and the present (2023). For this we train a segmentation model using the existing (manually corrected) inventory outlines. When evaluating the model on unseen data we find good agreement between the estimated areas and the inventory ones. Next, we develop a pipeline which automatically downloads Sentinel-2 data by minimizing the cloud coverage for each glacier separately. Finally, we apply the model on data from 2023 and then Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.estimate the area change both at individual glacier and regional level. The processed dataset ready for training and evaluating glacier mapping models, together with the code to (re)train the models are freely available at https://github.com/dcodrut/glacier_mapping_alps_tccml. 2 Data Inventory data. The first step is to collect the images which were employed to build the inventory [6], using exactly the same dates, to ensure that the outlines and the images correspond perfectly. The inventory contains 4395 glaciers with a total area of ca. 1806 km2and it was built using Sentinel-2 images mainly from 2015 (with some from 2016 and 2017). The previous inventory ( i.e. RGI v6 [13], from 2003) contains 3927 glaciers with a total area of ca. 2092 km2. When comparing them, a regional-level shrinkage can be estimated, i.e. -14% (-1.2% a−1). However, a more realistic estimate is -1.3% a−1when taking into account that the new inventory contains glaciers which were previously missing. Moreover, this is still considered a lower bound due to the inclusion of seasonal and perennial snow in a few sub-regions [6]. Given that the resolution of Sentinel-2 data is 10m, we decided to use only the glaciers with an area larger than 0.1 km2. Although this reduces the number of glaciers sampled (1646, i.e. about 37%), the percentage of glacierized area covered is close to 95%. To facilitate further analyses, we additionally drop 13 small glaciers (average area = 0.16 km2) which are not represented in the previous inventory from 2003. This results in 1633 glaciers, covering 94.36% of the current inventory area, which will be used to train and validate our model. Present data (2023).
