Distributional neural networks ensembles (DE) have been recently shown to outperform state of the art PEPF benchmarks. Still, they require reliability improvements, as fail to pass the coverage tests at various steps on the prediction horizon. In this work, we tackle this issue by extending the DE framework with the introduction of a Conformal Prediction based technique. Experiments have been conducted on multiple market regions, achieving day-ahead probabilistic forecasts with better hourly coverage. 1 I NTRODUCTION The availability of trustworthy day-ahead electricity price forecasting (EPF) systems is crucial for the effective operation in modern power markets. Beside being exploited by the companies to antic- ipate price movements and perform bidding strategies, EPF is a key enabler of further high-stakes decision-making stages, such as optimal generation management (Fusco et al., 2023), energy-aware planning and scheduling (Ramin et al., 2018), etc. In fact, EPF is a complex task exhibiting quite peculiar characteristics as compared to other traded commodities (Ciarreta et al., 2022). Latent non- linear relationships to conditioning variables (such as load, generation and weather conditions) are typically involved, including meshed short and long-term seasonalities, as well as sensible volatil- ity, usually orders of magnitude larger than in other utility tradings (Wagner et al., 2022). Over the years, a broad set of approaches have been investigated to perform EPF, from traditional statistical models to machine learning techniques. More detailed descriptions and comparisons can be found in (Weron, 2014), (Lago et al., 2021) and references therein. An increasing research interest is being devoted to neural network (NN) based probabilistic EPF (PEPF) (see e.g. Mashlakov et al. (2021) and references therein). Specifically, PEPF is aimed to characterize the underlying model uncertainty in the target space (Nowotarski & Weron, 2018). This is essential for supporting the operation inside electricity markets of increasing volatility (Brusaferri et al., 2019). Critical deviations have been injected by the repercussions of the steep gas price variations on the power plants. The increasing penetration of renewable sources in the generation mix, fundamental to contrast the global warming, is introducing further short-term price fluctuations to be promptly tackled. Additional variables such as the CO 2certificate prices interact with the power price features (Madadkhani & Ikonnikova, 2024). Ensembles of distributional NNs (i.e., Deep Ensembles) parameterizing flexible Johnson’s SU distributions have been recently proposed for this purpose, outperforming the state of the art PEPF benchmarks including both conventional Gaussian forms and the widely applied quantile regression on NN ensembles (Marcjasz et al., 2023). Despite the significant performances achieved, such models still require calibration improvements. Indeed, they fail to pass the coverage tests at various hours on the prediction horizon. ∗Corresponding author 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Hourly Kupiec test: (top)-PI 0.8; (bottom)-PI 0.6 In this work, we aim to tackle this open issue by extending the Deep Ensembles framework with the introduction of a Conformal Prediction (CP) based technique. Specifically, we target the approxi- mation of the feature conditioned day-ahead prices distribution through a discrete set of quantiles (e.g., deciles), coupled in prediction intervals (PIs) of increasing coverage degree around the me- dian. To this end, we leverage the asymmetric CP formulation proposed by (Romano et al., 2019) for regression tasks, developed through a daily recalibrated multi-horizon time series setup. Overall, this enhance local PIs reliability (i.e., sample-wise efficiency) beyond the CP marginal coverage. 2 M ETHODS The proposed PEPF approach consists of the following major ingredients. Each ensemble compo- nent is designed to provide day-ahead price predictions over the whole horizon h∈ {t+1,..., t+H} given the input conditioning set xtat time t. The latter can involve both past values of the target series and a set of exogenous variables. Considering the observations reported in (Lago et al., 2021), we employ feed-forward maps (labelled DNN hereafter), leaving a further investigation of alterna- tive architectures for future extensions.
