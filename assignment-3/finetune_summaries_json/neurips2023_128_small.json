Existing methods tend to either have low resolution, high latency (often a year or more), or rely on data typically unavailable at scale (such as self-reported energy consumption). We propose a machine learning based bottom-up model that combines satellite-imagery-derived features to compute Scope 1 global emissions estimates both for residential and commercial buildings at a 1km2resolution with monthly global updates. 1 Introduction Direct (a.k.a. Scope 11) emissions from residential and commercial buildings result from onsite fuel use such as natural gas, oil, and kerosene consumption. Residential buildings primarily use these fuels for thermal comfort (space and water heating), cooking, and other equipment and appliances; in commercial buildings, space and water heating generally remain the largest end-use. The magnitude of these end uses is correlated with, for example: building size, climate conditions, and the number of occupants [2]. However, timely and accessible high-spatial-resolution data on these are limited. Existing bottom-up methods leverage data typically not accessible at scale, such as information on a building’s insulation, appliances in a building, and information on occupant behavior [ 3]. These approaches may rely on building physics [ 4] or statistical approaches, but the data requirements for these approaches prevent them from being scaled globally. Existing top-down approaches look to find broad criteria by which to disaggregate values of energy consumption and associated emissions. Existing estimates include the Open-source Data Inventory for Anthropogenic CO 2[5], the Community Emissions Data System [ 6], the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) [ 7], the Global Carbon Grid [ 8], and the Global Gridded Daily CO2 Emissions Dataset (GRACED)[ 9]. While GRACED data is published near-monthly, most other key data are produced with a year or more of latency. Additionally, the highest resolution of 1\"Scope 1 emissions are direct greenhouse (GHG) emissions that occur from sources that are controlled or owned by an organization (e.g., emissions associated with fuel combustion in boilers, furnaces, vehicles).\" [1] Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.these data is 0.1 decimal degrees or roughly 11 km near the equator. Lastly, few of these models break down emissions into residential and commercial subsectors as well as separate emissions estimates into individual greenhouse gasses. 2 Proposed Building Emissions Machine Learning Model To address these challenges, we propose a high-resolution (1 km2)2, global machine learning (ML) model that is able to be updated monthly, separately provides estimates for both residential and commercial subsector Scope 1 building emissions, and provides estimates of the three primary greenhouse gasses (CO 2, CH 4, and NO x). This will be accomplished by estimating the presence and growth in building area ( A) from Sentinel-2 satellite imagery, predicting energy use intensity (EUI ) from contributing factors including temperature fluctuations and economic indicators, and determining regional emissions factors ( EF) based on regional fuel mixes used in buildings. We will estimate building emissions ( GHG ) as the product of these three quantities, GHG =A×EUI×EF. First, to predict building area, we will build on the work of Liu et al. 2023 [ 10] to estimate building area from publicly-available satellite imagery and apply this at a global scale, providing monthly estimates of building coverage.3Second, we will estimate energy use intensity (energy consumed per unit area of building).
