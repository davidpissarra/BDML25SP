We introduce a novel method for computing EVL with- out assuming fixed extreme representations, addressing the limitations of current models in capturing extreme weather events. We present both qual- itative and quantitative analyses, demonstrating the superior performance of the proposed NowcastingGPT-EVL in generating accurate precipitation forecasts, especially when dealing with extreme precipitation events. The code is available at https://github.com/Cmeo97/NowcastingGPT. 1 Introduction The advent of climate change has escalated the frequency of intense rainfall events across various regions worldwide, leading to considerable societal and infrastructural impacts (Al- fieri et al., 2017; Martinkova & Kysely, 2020; Klocek et al., 2021; Czibula et al., 2021; Malkin Ond´ ık et al., 2022). Consequently, the ability to accurately forecast short-term shifts in rainfall patterns is gaining importance, attracting a growing body of research focus (Shi et al., 2015; Trebing et al., 2021; Luo et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022). The field of precipita- tion nowcasting, which involves predicting rainfall changes within a six-hour window, plays a crucial role in enabling timely responses to these rapid meteorological variations (Veillette et al., 2020a; Malkin Ond´ ık et al., 2022; Yang & Mehrkanoon, 2022; Prudden et al., 2020). In the context of escalating climate change impacts, the field of precipitation nowcasting is increasingly vital for mitigating the adverse effects of intense rainfall events. This research area empowers the development of advanced forecasting models that can provide accurate, short-term rainfall predictions. Such capabilities are essential for proactive disaster man- agement and climate resilience strategies, enabling communities and infrastructure planners to prepare for and respond to extreme weather events more effectively, thereby contributing to meaningful efforts in addressing the climate crisis. 2 Related Works Conventional nowcasting techniques, exemplified by frameworks such as PySTEPS (Pulkki- nen et al., 2019), adopt the ensemble-based methodology reminiscent of Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) to incorporate uncertainty while modeling precipitation dynamics through the lens of the advection equation (Ravuri et al., 2021).

In the last few years, precipitation nowcasting using deep learning models has been cast as a video prediction problem (Bi et al., 2023; Bai et al., 2022; Luo et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022), where given an input spatio-temporal sequence of Nframes xin∈RN×H×W×C,H, W denote the spatial resolution and Crepre- sents the image channels or the different type of measurements (e.g., radar, heat maps, etc), the goal is to predict the next Mframes xout∈RM×H×W×C. Among the most notable advancements in the field, Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN; Goodfellow et al., 2014) have emerged as a powerful approach, exemplified by methods such as DGMR Ravuri et al.
