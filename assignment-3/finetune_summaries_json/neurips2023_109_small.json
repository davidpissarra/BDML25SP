The measurements were collected using the Vaisala Forward Scatter Sensor model FD70 and Weather Transmitter model WXT50, and Gill R3A ultrasonic anemometer mounted on the Research Vessel Atlantic Condor. To perform nowcasting, the time series of fog visibility (Vis), wind speed, dew point depression, and relative humidity with respect to water were preprocessed to have lagged time step features. Generative nowcasting of Vis time series for lead times of 30 and 60 minutes were performed using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) regression at visibility thresholds of Vis < 1 km and < 10 km. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used as a baseline method for comparison against cGAN. At the 30 min lead time, Vis was best predicted with cGAN at Vis < 1 km (RMSE = 0.151 km) and with XGBoost at Vis < 10 km (RMSE = 2.821 km). At the 60 min lead time, Vis was best predicted with XGBoost at Vis < 1 km (RMSE = 0.167 km) and Vis < 10 km (RMSE = 3.508 km), but the cGAN RMSE was similar to XGBoost. Despite nowcasting Vis at 30 min being quite difficult, the ability of the cGAN model to track the variation in Vis at 1 km suggests that there is potential for generative analysis of marine fog visibility using observational meteorological parameters.  1 Introduction Marine fog plays a role in a variety of aspects such as aviation (Gultepe et al., 2021a), marine shipping (Fernando et al., 2021), and vegetation (Schemenauer et al., 2016). Due to complex microphysical and dynamic interactions over a range of time and space scales, marine fog can form abruptly in marine environments. The intensity at which marine fog is formed is expressed as visibility (Vis). A previous field project (C-FOG) focused on coastal fog and its life cycle along the coastal areas near Nova Scotia, Canada (Fernando et al., 2021; Gultepe et al., 2021a). Owning to    2 the high variability of the fog life cycle with respect to its formation, development, and dissipation across different domains, the marine fog life cycle is significantly different from coastal fog (Gultepe et al., 2016; Koracin and Dorman, 2017) and requires a separate analysis of Vis. Marine fog nowcasting using Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models may have large uncertainties for time scales less than 6 hours (Gultepe et al., 2017), due to limited knowledge on nucleation processes and microphysical schemes (Gultepe et al., 2017; Seiki et al., 2015). As such, many nowcasting studies are limited because of their large time scale predictions. Predictions using ERA5 (fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Atmospheric Reanalysis) do not cover shorter time (< 1 hr) (Shan et al. 2019) and space scales (<1 km) (Pavolonis et al., 2005; Mecikalski et al., 2007). Nowcasting using satellite observations are also limited because infrared (IR) channels have a resolution of usually 1 km and short-wave infrared (SWIR) channels cannot be used accurately for monitoring daytime fog (Gultepe et al., 2021a; Pavolonis et al., 2005).   The limitations of microphysical parameterizations for NWP models used for Vis prediction suggests that alternate techniques are needed for time scales less than 6 hours. Shan et al. (2019) demonstrated that machine learning (ML) techniques can be used for fog Vis prediction. Typically, these studies use ERA5 reanalysis or similar archival datasets, which use hourly, 3-hourly, or daily observations (Pelaez-Rodriguez et al., 2023, Shan et al., 2019). However, fog can form and dissipate\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

The data were collected using Vaisala Forward Scatter Sensor and Weather Transmitter models, as well as a Gill R3A ultrasonic anemometer on the Research Vessel Atlantic Condor. To perform nowcasting, the time series of fog visibility, wind speed, dew point depression, and relative humidity were preprocessed to include lagged time step features. Generative nowcasting of fog visibility time series for lead times of 30 and 60 minutes was performed using conditional generative adversarial networks (cGAN) regression at visibility thresholds of less than 1 km and less than 10 km. Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) was used as a baseline method for comparison against cGAN. At the 30-minute lead time, cGAN best predicted fog visibility at less than 1 km (RMSE = 0.151 km) and XGBoost best predicted at less than 10 km (RMSE = 2.821 km). At the 60-minute lead time, XGBoost best predicted fog visibility at both less than 1 km (RMSE = 0.167 km) and less than 10 km (RMSE = 3.508 km), with cGAN's RMSE being similar. Despite the difficulty of nowcasting fog visibility at 30 minutes, the cGAN model's ability to track the variation in fog visibility at 1 km suggests potential for generative analysis of marine fog visibility using observational meteorological parameters.\n\nIntroduction\nMarine fog plays a significant role in various aspects, including aviation, marine shipping, and vegetation.
