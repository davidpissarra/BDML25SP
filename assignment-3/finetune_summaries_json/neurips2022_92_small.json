They generate a greenhouse effect by absorbing or directing back to Earth approximately 33% of emitted outgoing longwave radiation[ 1]. They account for over half of the climate change resulting from aviation activities. Avoiding contrails and adjusting flight routes could be an inexpensive and effective way to reduce their impact. An accurate, automated, and reliable detection algorithm is required to develop and evaluate contrail avoidance strategies. Advancement in contrail detection has been severely limited due to several factors, primarily due to a lack of quality-labeled data. Recently, [ 2] proposed a large human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset. Each contrail is carefully labeled with various inputs in various scenes of Landsat-8 satellite imagery. In this work, we benchmark several popular segmentation models with combinations of different loss functions and encoder backbones. This work is the first to apply state-of-the-art segmentation techniques to detect contrails in low-orbit satellite imagery. Our work can also be used as an open benchmark for contrail segmentation and is available at https://github.com/Kasliwal17/ Contrail_Segmentation. 1 Introduction Contrails, or vapor trails, usually form when water vapor from the exhaust combines with the low ambient temperatures in high-altitude regions. These contrails create an additional blanket of clouds, increasing the heat-trapping effect that directly contributes to global warming. Although some may be short-lived, they can, in many cases, linger for hours[ 3], which results in new contrails created by aircraft flying on the same routes, accumulating and forming a ’contrail cirrus’[ 4][5], which worsens the heat-trapping effect. As a result, contrails have become a new cause of alarm for climate change ∗Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, India †Authors have contributed equally to this work Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.as they have become one of the most significant contributors to global warming caused by the aviation industry[6]. An effective solution that can reduce the effect of contrails is to avoid the regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough to create contrails[ 7] and to adjust flight routes and slight changes in flight altitudes[ 8] to reduce the air traffic in such regions. This can be a relatively easy solu- tion to prevent contrail formations and their effects, given that a comparably small proportion of aircraft contributes majorly. Physics-based models such as CoCIP[ 9] and APCEMM[ 10] simulate contrails’ microphysics and radiative transfer effects but suffer from uncertainties in their inputs. These uncertainties -such as the spatial resolution of numerical weather models and limitations of high-altitude humidity measurements[ 11]) - result in large errors in contrail RF predictions from such models. Contrail detection work in aerial images can be largely attributed to Mannstein et al.[12][13][14][15][16][17][18]. This algorithm operates on brightness temperature imagery using a sequence of manually designed convolution and thresholding procedures, followed by recognizing appropriate linear linked components. The algorithm is tuned to have either high precision or recall; however, no single model has succeeded in achieving both simultaneously. Apart from this, deep learn- ing models have been used for contrail detection using images of GOES-16 satellite[ 19] and images from Himawari-8 stationary satellite[ 20]. However, apart from [ 21] that has used Hough Transforms to segment A VHRR imagery, no work to our knowledge, has been done in over two decades to implement neural network-based segmentation models for contrails detection and Landsat-8 data. This work explores the potential of ’deep convolutional nets’ to identify and segment contrails in satellite imagery. For this purpose, we use popular semantic segmentation models, such as UNet[ 22], PSP Net[ 23], DeepLab V3[ 24] and DeepLab V3+[ 25] with different combinations of loss functions and encoders to adjust it accordingly for capturing the intricacies of contrails and achieve a more generalized result. We train these models on the labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset proposed by [2], which consists of several scenes from the Landsat-8 satellite in which the contrails have been identified and marked as bounding polygons. We hope our proposed methods can be used as a benchmark for further work on this dataset and open the way for more substantial research on this domain. 2 Data The dataset[ 2] includes Landsat-8 scenes (primarily from 2018 and inside the viewable extent of the GOES-16 satellite), which have been reviewed by human labellers taught to identify and mark the bounding polygon of each contrail in the scene.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
