Traditionally limited by a scarcity of species observations, these models have significantly improved in performance through the integration of larger datasets provided by citizen science initiatives. However, they still suffer from the strong class imbalance between species within these datasets, often resulting in the penalization of rare species– those most critical for conservation efforts. To tackle this issue, this study assesses the effectiveness of training deep learning models using a balanced presence-only loss function on large citizen science-based datasets. We demonstrate that this imbalance-aware loss function outperforms traditional loss functions across vari- ous datasets and tasks, particularly in accurately modeling rare species with lim- ited observations. 1 I NTRODUCTION Species distribution models (SDMs) play a crucial role in ecology, serving as indispensable tools for understanding and predicting the spatial distribution of species. By establishing correlations between species occurrence data and environmental variables (Elith and Leathwick, 2009), these models provide valuable insights into the ecological niches and habitat preferences of diverse or- ganisms, thereby informing conservation efforts (Guisan et al., 2013). The significance of SDMs in identifying and safeguarding endangered species becomes even more pronounced as habitats of numerous species face imminent threats from climate change (Thomas et al., 2004; Dyderski et al., 2018). Additionally, conservation endeavors aimed at preventing biodiversity loss not only con- tribute to mitigating climate change (Shin et al., 2022) but also play an important role in alleviating its broader impacts (P ¨ortner et al., 2023). These conservation efforts primarily focus on rare and endangered species, which are inherently difficult to observe. Consequently, we have only a few observations available, posing challenges to the development of reliable SDMs (Breiner et al., 2015). Recent initiatives in citizen science present promising avenues to facilitate the collection of large amounts of species records. However, there is still a high disparity in the number of observations per species, ranging from a few handfuls of occurrences to tens of thousands for the most common or iconic species (Botella et al., 2023; Cole et al., 2023). Such a significant class imbalance reflects the existence of various biases within the data, which can be geographical and taxonomic, among others (Feldman et al., 2021). Additionally, the data gathered through citizen science initiatives is typically presence-only, i.e., it consists of recorded occurrences but no data regarding the species’ absence (Pearce and Boyce, 2006). Manag- ing such data limitations brings additional complexities in developing accurate and reliable SDMs for rare species. Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for SDMs (Deneu et al., 2021; Teng et al., 2023), by enabling the simultaneous modeling of multiple species and the identification of shared environ- 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 0 1000 2000 3000 4000 #presences0200400600species countGeoLifeCLEF training data 200 400 600 800 1000 #presences02500500075001000012500species countiNaturalist training data Figure 1: Distributions of the number of presence records in the GeoLifeCLEF 2023 (left) and iNaturalist (right) training datasets, obtained through citizen science initiatives.

(2020). In this study, we extend their work to larger datasets acquired through citizen science initiatives at continental and global scales (Botella et al., 2023; Cole et al., 2023).
