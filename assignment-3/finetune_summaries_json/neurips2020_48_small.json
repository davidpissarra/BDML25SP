E-Mail: {crequ, vbenson}@bgc-jena.mpg.de Abstract Climate change is global, yet its concrete impacts can strongly vary between different locations in the same region. Regional climate projections and seasonal weather forecasts currently operate at the mesoscale (> 1km). For more targeted mitigation and adaptation, modelling impacts to < 100m is needed. Yet, the relationship between driving variables and Earth’s surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical models and is partly unknown; hence, it is a source of considerable uncertainty. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to create machine learning models capable of translating coarse weather information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts encompassing localized climate impacts.Here, we deﬁne high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled with deep learning models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20m resolution, matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale ( 1:28km) weather variables. With over 32000 samples it is suitable for training deep neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial. Hence, we deﬁne the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for models forecasting Earth surface reﬂectance. For model intercomparison we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge with four tracks based on different test sets. These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation indices, capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments, coastline management, or biodiversity monitoring.

As already noticed by Alexander von Humboldt, climate is a key factor shaping vegetation cover and soils on Earth. Yet, importantly, the impact of the climatic drivers onto the surface is highly modulated by the ﬁne-grained local conditions, such as geomorphology, geological substrate and vegetation and animals themselves. In particular extreme events can have very heterogeneous impacts at the local scale depending on the conditions (Kogan, 1990). For example, ecosystems next to a river might survive droughts better than those on south-facing slopes. However, the resolution of seasonal weather predictions is not ﬁne enough to deploy effective prevention and mitigation strategies. Machine learning (Reichstein et al., 2019; Rolnick et al., 2019) can step in to increase resolution. Predicting localized climate impacts can be tackled in three main ways (see Fig. 2). All approaches make use of seasonal weather forecasts ( 2–6months ahead; Cantelaube & Terres, 2005). The ﬁrst approach (Fig. 2, path 1), aims to reconstruct hyper-resolution weather forecasts for particular geolocations using statistical (Boé et al., 2006; Vrac et al., 2007) or dynamical (Lo et al., 2008) downscaling, that is, correlating the past observed weather with past mesoscale model outputs and using the estimated relationship. The downscaled weather can then be used in mechanistic models (e.g. of river discharge) for impact extraction. However, weather downscaling is a difﬁcult task because it requires ground observations from weather stations, which are sparse. A more direct way (Fig. 2, path 2) is to correlate a desired future impact variable with past data. Doing this for tangible impacts such as on crop yield (Peng et al., 2018) again suffers from a lack of data. An alternative is to forecast impacts obtainable from remote sensing, such as the normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI), yet this has only been done at coarse resolution (Tadesse et al., 2010; Asoka & Mishra, 2015; Kraft et al., 2019; Foley et al.,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Current regional climate projections and seasonal weather forecasts operate at the mesoscale (> 1km). To develop targeted mitigation and adaptation strategies, modeling impacts at a scale of less than 100m is necessary. However, the relationship between driving variables and the Earth's surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical models and is partly unknown, leading to considerable uncertainty. Large Earth observation datasets now enable the creation of machine learning models that can translate coarse weather information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts, including localized climate impacts.\n\nHere, we define high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled using deep learning models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20m resolution, matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale (1:28km) weather variables. With over 32,000 samples, it is suitable for training deep neural networks.\n\nComparing multiple Earth surface forecasts is not trivial.
