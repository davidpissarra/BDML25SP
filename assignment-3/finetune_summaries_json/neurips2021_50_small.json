Our work extends these results to consider more extreme trafﬁc settings, where trafﬁc jams have already formed, and environments with limited cooperation. We show that even with the added realism of these chal- lenges, piecewise constant controllers, trained using deep reinforcement learning, can essentially eliminate stop-and-go trafﬁc when actions are held ﬁxed for up to 5 seconds. Even up to 10-second action holds, such controllers show congestion beneﬁts over a human driving baseline. These ﬁndings are a stepping-stone for near-term deployment of vehicle-based congestion mitigation. 1 Introduction Greenhouse gases (GHGs) are gases that trap heat in the atmosphere and are a key contributor to climate change. Carbon dioxide (CO 2) makes up 80% of the United States GHG emissions in 2019. In particular, the transportation sector, primarily due to the combustion of fossil fuels like diesel and gasoline, causes signiﬁcant CO 2emissions, making up about 35% of the total CO 2emissions and 29% of GHG emissions in 2019. The largest source of carbon dioxide emissions within transporation is land transport, representing emissions from passenger cars and light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks, which make up over 70% of the total CO 2emissions within the sector [1]. We focus on reducing total emissions by improving trafﬁc ﬂow on the road and reducing congestion by designing vehicular controllers with deep reinforcement learning (RL). Previous work by Wu et al. shows that it is possible to nearly eliminate congestion and increase average speeds by up to 57% in idealized trafﬁc settings using a small fraction of RL-controlled autonomous vehicles (A Vs) on the road [ 2]. Further work by Sridhar et al. shows that these results can be reproduced with piecewise constant policies, a simpliﬁed class of reinforcement learning policies designed to be executable by humans. This suggests that we can use RL to empower human drivers to execute real-time congestion mitigation behavior in the near future, sidestepping the deployment obstacles for autonomous vehicles [3]. We expand upon prior work by investigating how well piecewise constant policies work in more complex settings by analyzing their potential to remove an existing trafﬁc jam. In particular, our work offers two contributions: •We show that piecewise constant policies, trained using deep reinforcement learning, can dissipate shock waves even after the formation of a severe trafﬁc jam.

For instance, the Environmental Protection Agency suggests avoiding unnecessary idling in cars and buses [ 1]. Previous work by Barth et al. shows that even simple trafﬁc management strategies can signiﬁcantly reduce emissions on the road. Based on typical trafﬁc conditions in Southern California, they show that CO 2emissions can be reduced by almost 20% by combining strategies for congestion mitigation, speed management, and shock wave suppression to reduce stop-and-go trafﬁc [ 4]. Moreover, the Greek eco-driving program showed that bus drivers can reduce average fuel consumption (correlated with emissions) by 10.2% through simple strategies like maintaining steady speeds and anticipating trafﬁc ﬂows [5]. Advances in vehicle connectivity and control through RL allows us to take this a step further by directly optimizing for complex objectives. Our work focuses on leveraging RL to control vehicles to mitigate congestion and reduce overall emissions. 2.2 Policy class We follow the model described in Sridhar et al. for formulating piecewise constant controllers. That is, previous human factors studies show that shared control on the road (for example, with semi-autonomous vehicles) can lead to increased safety risks [ 6,7]. However, as discussed, studies suggest that even simple changes to driving styles can signiﬁcantly impact congestion. Thus, we focus on a setting where human drivers are fully in control by designing policies that can be deployed as a minimally intrusive real-time app (similar to Google Maps) which provides personalized driving advice with minimal safety impacts [3].
