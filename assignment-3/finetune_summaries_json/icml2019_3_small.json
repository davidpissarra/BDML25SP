Our system- atic solution provides comprehensive ﬁne-grained occupancy information in a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving manner, which facilitates eco- friendly and sustainable buildings. 1. Introduction Energy consumption of buildings, both residential and com- mercial, account for more than 50% of global electricity and 40% CO2emissions worldwide (Allouhi et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2018). In efforts to improve energy efﬁciency in buildings, researchers and industry leaders have attempted to implement various control and automation approaches alongside techniques like incentive design and price adjust- ment to more effectively regulate the energy usage. Lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (L-HV AC) systems are the most energy consuming components in a building, which contribute over 70% of the total building energy con- sumption (Jin et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2017a; Weekly et al., 2018). Prior studies have shown that huge amounts of en- ergy is wasted from L-HV AC systems in unoccupied spaces since most of Building Management Systems (BMSs) oper- ate based on static schedules (Yang et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2015). Occupancy based control algorithms for L-HV AC have proven effective in saving considerable amount of energy (Zou et al., 2018a).

With the pervasive availability of WiFi infrastructure in both residential and commercial buildings, and nearly every mo- bile device (MD) is embedded with a WiFi module, WiFi has been acknowledged as the most promising modality for indoor context-aware services and location-based services (Lymberopoulos et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2017c; Yang et al., 2018a). In this work, we introduce WiFi enabled occupancy sensing platform, and propose Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including ad- versarial learning, deep learning and transfer learning, to address longstanding challenging problems in occupancy sensing, such as extensive human intervention, environmen- tal and temporal dynamics. 2. WiFi-based Occupant Positioning System WiFi-based Occupant Positioning System (OPSs) usually adopt ﬁngerprinting method as the localization engine as it can capture signal variations in complex indoor environ- ments (Zou et al., 2016). It comprises of 2 steps: 1) Ofﬂine site survey phase: Received Signal Strength (RSS) measure- ments from multiple WiF access points (APs) at predeﬁned calibration points (CPs) and their physical coordinates are collected and formed a ﬁngerprint database (a.k.a radio map); 2) Online testing phase: the location of a MD is estimated by comparing the real-time RSS readings to the ﬁngerprints stored in the database. Two major bottlenecks hinder WiFi-based OPS for pervasive implementation: 1) the ofﬂine site survey process is extremely labor-intensive and time-consuming; 2) the manual calibrated radio map is vulnerable to temporal and spatial dynamics.

Introduction\n\nEnergy consumption of buildings, both residential and commercial, accounts for more than 50% of global electricity and 40% CO2 emissions worldwide (Allouhi et al., 2015; Jia et al., 2018). To improve energy efficiency in buildings, researchers and industry leaders have implemented various control and automation approaches, alongside techniques like incentive design and price adjustment, to regulate energy usage more effectively. Lighting, heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (L-HVAC) systems are the most energy-consuming components in a building, contributing over 70% of the total building energy consumption (Jin et al., 2014; Zou et al., 2017a; Weekly et al., 2018). Prior studies have shown that significant amounts of energy are wasted from L-HVAC systems in unoccupied spaces since most Building Management Systems (BMSs) operate based on static schedules (Yang et al., 2016; Pan et al., 2015). Occupancy-based control algorithms for L-HVAC have proven effective in saving considerable amounts of energy (Zou et al., 2018a). Thus, accurate and robust occupancy and occupant activity sensing in buildings serves as a precursor for intelligent control and energy efficiency.\n\nWith the pervasive availability of WiFi infrastructure in both residential and commercial buildings, and nearly every mobile device (MD) embedded with a WiFi module, WiFi has been acknowledged as the most promising modality for indoor context-aware services and location-based services (Lymberopoulos et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2016; Jia et al., 2016; Zou et al., 2017c; Yang et al., 2018a). In this work, we introduce a WiFi-enabled occupancy sensing platform and propose Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including adversarial learning, deep learning, and transfer learning, to address longstanding challenging problems in occupancy sensing, such as extensive human intervention, environmental, and temporal dynamics.\n\n2. WiFi-based Occupant Positioning System\n\nWiFi-based Occupant Positioning Systems (OPSs) usually adopt fingerprinting methods as the localization engine, as they can capture signal variations in complex indoor environments (Zou et al., 2016). The system comprises two steps: \n\n1. Offline site survey phase: Received Signal Strength (RSS) measurements from multiple WiFi access points (APs) at predefined calibration points (CPs) and their physical coordinates are collected and formed a fingerprint database (also known as a radio map).\n2.
