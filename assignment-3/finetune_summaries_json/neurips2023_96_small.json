However, reliably forecasting the potential air quality impact from these prescribed fires, a critical ingredient in determining the firesâ€™ location and time, at hourly to daily time scales remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes a novel integration of prescribed fire simulation with a spatio-temporal graph neural network-based PM 2.5forecasting model. The experiments in this work focus on determining the optimal time for implementing prescribed fires in California as well as quantifying the potential air quality trade-offs involved in conducting more prescribed fires outside the fire season. 1 Introduction Across many parts of the western United States (WUS), wildfire size, severity, and fire season length have increased due to climate change. Wildfires across the WUS have led to the largest daily mean PM2.5(particulate matter < 2.5 microns) concentrations observed by ground-based sensors in recent years ( 1), and exposure to PM 2.5is responsible for 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide per year (2). Within California, additional PM 2.5emissions from extreme wildfires over the past 8 years have reversed nearly two decades of decline in ambient PM 2.5concentrations (3). Prescribed fires, or controlled burns, have been widely accepted as an effective land management tool and could have the potential to reduce the resulting smoke from future wildfires ( 4). Since air quality is a major public concern surrounding prescribed fires ( 5), land managers conducting these burns require access to robust, near real-time predictions of downwind air pollution in order to determine suitable locations and burn windows. This paper introduces a graph neural network (GNN) model that incorporates satellite observations of fire behavior in order to forecast PM 2.5emissions from ambient sources, observed fires, and simulated controlled burns. Our GNN-based forecasting system can aid land managers in minimizing the PM 2.5exposure of vulnerable populations during controlled burns and inform the public when proposing prescribed fires. 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).2 Related Work Previous works studying the effect of prescribed fires used chemical transport models (CTMs) like the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) and Goddard Earth Observing System Atmospheric Chemistry (GEOS-Chem) models to calculate the PM 2.5impact of prescribed fires at different locations ( 4). While CTMs can model the chemical processes in PM 2.5transport, generating accurate predictions requires a large volume of information because of the complex chemical interactions. Furthermore, the extensive calculations in CTMs make it challenging to explore a large range of parameters for simulating prescribed burns ( 6;7;8). In air quality predictions, machine learning models have been shown to outperform CTMs in terms of accuracy and computational burden ( 9). While several past works use machine learning to forecast air quality ( 10;11), ours is the first research paper to our knowledge that utilizes machine learning to predict the PM 2.5concentrations from simulated prescribed fires. Our research builds upon the GNN machine learning model from Wang et al. (2020) ( 11), which was used to forecast non-wildfire-influenced PM 2.5pollution in China. In contrast, this work focuses on simulating the effect of prescribed fires and predicting fire-influenced PM 2.5in California. 3 Methods 3.1 Dataset Our dataset consists of PM 2.5, meteorological, and fire data at an hourly resolution over 5 years (2017-2021). The PM 2.5concentration data, at a total of 112 air quality sensor locations in California, is collected from both the California Air Resources Board as well as the Environmental Protection Agency ( 12;13). The data for the 7 meteorological variables, which include u and v horizontal components of wind, total precipitation, and air temperature, are retrieved from the ERA5 Reanalysis database ( 14). The full list of predictors is in Table 1. Though the meteorological variables may capture the diurnal PM 2.5cycles and seasonal patterns, the Julian date and hour of the day are also included as predictors in order to provide the model with additional context. The fire radiative power (FRP) provides information about the fire intensity. The FRP at each fire location is taken from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) ( 15) instrument on board the Suomi satellites. In order to assess the impact of nearby fires at the location of a PM 2.5 monitor, we aggregate the FRP values of all active fires within radii of 25km, 50km, 100km, and 500km. To emphasize the fires that would likely have a more substantial downwind effect on PM 2.5 concentrations, we use inverse distance weighting (IDW) and wind-based weighting in the FRP\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
