In this work, we develop a deep learning model called ForestNet to classify the drivers of primary forest loss in Indonesia, a country with one of the highest deforestation rates in the world. Using satellite imagery, ForestNet identiﬁes the direct drivers of deforestation in forest loss patches of any size. We curate a dataset of Landsat 8 satellite images of known forest loss events paired with driver annotations from expert interpreters. We use the dataset to train and validate the models and demon- strate that ForestNet substantially outperforms other standard driver classiﬁcation approaches. In order to support future research on automated approaches to defor- estation driver classiﬁcation, the dataset curated in this study is publicly available athttps://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/forestnet. 1 Introduction The preservation of forests is crucial for preventing loss of biodiversity, managing air and water quality, and mitigating climate change [ 1,2]. Forest loss in the tropics, which contributes to around 10% of annual global greenhouse gas emissions [ 3], must be reduced to decrease the potential for climate tipping points [ 4]. The direct drivers of tropical deforestation, or the speciﬁc activities which lead to forest cover loss, include natural events like wildﬁres, as well as human-induced land uses such as industrial and smallholder agricultural development [ 5]. Determining the extent to which these processes contribute to forest loss enables companies to fulﬁll their zero-deforestation commitments and helps decision-makers design, implement, and enforce targeted conservation and management policies [ 6,7,8,9]. Indonesia has one of the highest rates of primary forest loss in the tropics that places it among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases worldwide [ 10]. Recent work using high-resolution satellite imagery to manually classify the direct drivers of forest loss in Indonesia provides critical information about the nationwide causes of deforestation [ 11]. Methods to automate driver classiﬁcation would enable more spatially-broad and temporally-dense driver attribution with signiﬁcant implications on forest conservation policies. The growth in availability of high-resolution satellite imagery coupled with advancements in deep learning methods present opportunities to automatically derive geospatial insights at scale [ 12,13]. Recently, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled a variety of satellite-image based applications, including extracting socioeconomic data for tracking poverty [ 14], classifying land use \u0003Equal contribution. yEqual contribution. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.Driver Class, N Training Validation Test Plantation 686 219 265 Smallholder Agriculture 556 138 207 Grassland/shrubland 143 47 85 Other 231 70 112 Overall 1,616 474 669 Table 1: Number of events per driver class in the training, validation, and test sets.

In this work, we train CNNs to identify the direct drivers (plantation, smallholder agriculture, grassland/shrubland, or other drivers) of primary forest loss using satellite imagery in Indonesia.
