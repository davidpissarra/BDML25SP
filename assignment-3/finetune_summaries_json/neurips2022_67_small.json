Existing statistical downscaling (SD) methods that learn to map coarse-resolution versions of historical reanalysis data to generate finer resolution outputs are of limited use when applied to future climate model projections due to the domain gap between climate models and reanalysis data. In contrast, we present EnhancedSD, a deep learning-based framework for downscaling coarse-scale climate model outputs to high-resolution observational (reanalysis) data. Our proposed ML based downscaling allows for future reanalysis projections, which can be pivotal for mitigating climate change’s impacts on power systems planning. 1 Introduction Renewable energy-based electricity systems can potentially reduce not only the 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions that currently stem from electricity generation but also large amounts of emissions from the transportation, industrial, and agricultural sectors. While net-zero emission electricity systems are perhaps the most critical mitigation option for combating climate change, they themselves require adaptation to climate change’s impacts. Power system planning has traditionally relied on historical demand and solar resource data to plan future generation and transmission build- outs, implicitly assuming a stationary climate. We have already seen the dire impacts, in terms of loss of life and economic ramifications, of failing to account for correlated generation failures induced by climate change in the February 2021 Texas Power outage [3]. The largest impediment to mitigating impacts of climate change-induced events in applications such as power generation planning is the lack of high-quality datasets translating expected future climate change impacts on variables like solar irradiance. Owing to high-computational requirements, climate models are run at very coarse resolutions, on the order of 111 kms ( 1◦), yet climate variables are needed at a much higher resolution, typically 27 kms ( 0.25◦) or higher for assessing the regional impacts. SD techniques are used to mitigate the low spatial resolution of climate model outputs by learning a functional form to map coarse-scale to fine-scale observational data. Recently, a variety of statistical [ 4,10] and machine learning (ML) based models [ 22,6,7,13] have been applied for SD ∗Corresponding author: Nidhin Harilal, nidhin.harilal@colorado.edu Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.of different climate variables. Despite the availability of many techniques, the existing approaches consider coarse-resolution versions of the same observational data (reanalysis) to generate finer- resolution outputs. This way of mapping limits the generality of SD approaches when applied to future climate model outputs due to the significant domain gap between climate model outputs and observational (reanalysis) data. In this study, we propose EnhancedSD - an end-to-end model design to massively downscale present and future climate projections from current generation climate model outputs to high-resolution observational (reanalysis) data. Complex and non-linear inter-dependencies among climate variables and reanalysis at different resolutions motivated us to combine various neural network-based super- resolution techniques to design this model. Super-resolution [ 5] refers to ML methods, often inspired by problems in computer vision, that address the downscaling task, i.e., learning a model that will map a coarse resolution spatial grid to one of a finer spatial resolution. We apply our approach to downscale climate model forecasts for solar irradiation over the Continental United States (CONUS), where the rich, high-resolution data required for power system studies is available, with which to validate our predictions. Contributions: We propose EnhancedSD, designed to downscale coarse-scale climate model outputs while correcting its bias to fine-scale reanalysis. We showcase the generality of EnhancedSD on solar irradiance data allowing fine-scale predictions of future reanalysis-resolution projections (called reanalysis projections hereafter), and plan to make it publicly available for use by the power systems community to design net-zero future power systems. Pathways to Climate Impact: EnhancedSD is designed to model the gap between coarse-resolution climate model outputs and fine-resolution reanalysis. Predicting high-resolution reanalysis for future climate scenarios is critically important to fully understand the impacts of climate change and inform adaptation strategies. Future reanalysis predictions will have a broad potential user base: from academics creating innovative new technologies for renewable energy integration to power utilities currently planning the future power grid based on historical climate data. 2 Proposed Method EnhancedSD consists of an end-to-end model design combining several ideas based on re- cent advances in super-resolution for computer vision [ 5,24]. Specifically, we employ Residual-in-Residual Dense Blocks (RRDBs) [ 23] for learning in the coarse-resolution space.
