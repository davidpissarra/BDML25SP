However, this “eyeball metric” cannot be used for machine learning where an algorithmic description is required. Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as basis for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision, we present a novel, self-supervised representation learning approach speciﬁcally designed for atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of a randomly shufﬂed sequence of atmospheric ﬁelds (e.g. the components of the wind ﬁeld from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network to learn important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers and from these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this by using AtmoDist to deﬁne a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity and divergence. Our upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its statistics a high resolution reference closely and it signiﬁcantly outperform the state-of-the-art based on mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is unsupervised, only requires a temporal sequence of ﬁelds, and uses a simple auxiliary task, it has the potential to be of utility in a wide range of applications. 1 Introduction A discriminative distance measure for atmospheric dynamics is critical for a wide range of applica- tions addressing climate change. Such a measure could, for instance, enable climate scientists to automatically classify patterns, such as polar jet behavior or blocking events, and how these change under anthropogenic forcing. It is also an amplifying technology for many machine learning tech- niques in the context of climate change since it allows for more effective loss functions or evaluation metrics. A third potential application, and the one motivating the present work, is the use in a hybrid climate simulations where a classical discretization is combined with a neural network that corrects for model biases and represents unresolved scales. Motivated by the deﬁciencies of existing distance measures [Stengel et al., 2020], we introduce in the present work AtmoDist, a representation learning approach tailored towards atmospheric dynamics that uses intermediate neural network activations to obtain an effective metric for such data. AtmoDist only requires time series of one or more atmospheric ﬁelds, e.g. from reanalysis or a simulation, as 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.Stack - 256shared weights   3x3 Conv - 128 ﬂatten3x3 Conv - 128 Linear + softmax Patch 2 (at t + dt) 160x160 160x160Patch 1 (at time t) 8x8 Conv - 16 3x3 MaxPool 3x3 ResBlock - 16 3x3 ResBlock - 32 3x3 ResBlock - 64 3x3 ResBlock - 1288x8 Conv - 16 3x3 MaxPool 3x3 ResBlock - 16 3x3 ResBlock - 32 3x3 ResBlock - 64 3x3 ResBlock - 128 representation networkcomparison network6x 6x 6x 6x 6x 6x 6x 6x Figure 1: Network architecture used for AtmoDist.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nA visual inspection is often used in practice to determine the distance between atmospheric fields. However, this \"eyeball metric\" is not suitable for machine learning, which requires an algorithmic description. Motivated by the success of intermediate neural network activations as a basis for learned metrics in computer vision, we present a novel, self-supervised representation learning approach specifically designed for atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural network on a simple auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between elements of a randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g., the components of the wind field from reanalysis or simulation). This task forces the network to learn important intrinsic aspects of the data, which can be used to obtain a discriminative metric. We demonstrate this by using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super-resolution of vorticity and divergence. Our results show that the upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its statistics a high-resolution reference closely and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art based on mean squared error.\n\nA discriminative distance measure for atmospheric dynamics is critical for various applications addressing climate change.
