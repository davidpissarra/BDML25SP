Experiments demonstrate that a multimodal ap- proach, that is combining text and statistical data, outperforms a single-modality approach. Our most advanced architecture, employing embeddings extracted us- ing transfer learning upon DistilBert model, achieves 75%-77% ROCAUC score in predicting the next 1-5 year ﬂooding event in historically ﬂooded locations. This work demonstrates the potentials of using machine learning for long-term planning in natural disaster management. 1 I NTRODUCTION A disastrous ﬂood in 2022 left one third of the land in Pakistan underwater for over four months, affecting 33 million people in the country and causing over 30 billion US dollars of damage (United Nations). Globally, ﬂoods cost billions of dollars each year and inﬂict massive damage to human life, infrastructure, agriculture, and industrial activities. Most concerningly, studies suggest climate change impacts lead to drastically increasing ﬂooding risks globally in both frequency and scale (Wing et al., 2022; Hirabayashi et al., 2013). Therefore, it is crucial to develop both short-term and long-term predictions for ﬂood events to mitigate damage. Most established models for ﬂood prediction use physical models to simulate hydrological dynam- ics. Kauffeldt et al. (2016) provides a technical review of large-scale hydrodynamical models em- ployed in various continents. The most advanced models take into consideration terrain data, wa- ter ﬂow data, river networks (Sampson et al., 2015). To combine insights from individual models and reduce errors, most forecasting agencies, such as the pan-European Flood Awareness System (EFAS), employ an ensemble of predictions across many individual hydrological models to produce probabilistic forecasts (Thielen et al., 2009). Physical models dominate short-term ﬂood prediction space; however, they lack forecasting capabil- ities for a longer horizon due to escalating simulation errors. To address this need, machine learning can emerge as a powerful tool to offer a predictive perspective. Mosavi et al. (2018) provides an extensive literature review on the recent ML approaches. Most early works of machine learning approaches are based on a single modality of data, such as rainfall and water level data (Sajedi- Hosseini et al., 2018; Choubin et al., 2018; Elsaﬁ, 2014), or remote-sensing dataset such as satellite and radars to capture real-time high resolution rain gauges (Kim & Barros, 2001; Sampson et al., 2015). Multimodal machine learning, referring to models that employ more than one modality of data such as tabular, imagery, text, or other formats, have been recently applied for ﬂood detection purposes. For instance, de Bruijn et al. (2020) combines hydrological information with twitter data to detect and monitor ﬂood. This work presents a multimodal machine learning approach combining for global multi-year ﬂood prediction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst machine learning ﬂood prediction model at 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 the global scale and on a multi-year horizon. In addition, it is the ﬁrst time text-based data has been applied to ﬂood prediction. Our main contributions are three-fold: 1. A novel multimodal framework to incorporate text-based geographical information to com- plement time-series statistical features for global ﬂood prediction. We employ state-of-the art large natural language processing techniques, including ﬁne-tuning and transfer learning on pre-trained BERT models. 2. Our experiments show strong results for multi-year ﬂood risk forecasting, with the strongest model achieving 75%-77% ROCAUC score in the next 1-5 year ﬂooding prediction. In addition, we show that multimodal models, combining text with statistical data, outperform single-modal models using only statistical data. 3. Our framework can be generalised to other natural disaster forecasting tasks such as the wildﬁres, earthquakes, droughts, and extreme weather events. Thus, this works suggests a promising direction in long-term preparation for natural disaster management. 2 D ATA Historical Flood Data. We use the Geocoded Disasters (GDIS) dataset, which includes geocoded information on 9,924 unique natural disasters occurred globally between 1960 and 2018 (Rosvold & Buhaug, 2021).
