In this project, we use Skip-gram word embeddings trained on the ukWaC corpus as a lens to study the implicit mental representations people have of foods. Our data-driven insights expand on ﬁndings from traditional, interview-based studies by uncovering implicit mental representations, allowing a better understanding the complex combination of conscious and sub-conscious processes surrounding food choice. In particular, our ﬁndings shed light on the pervasiveness of meat as the ‘centre’ of the meal in the UK. 1 I NTRODUCTION According to current projections, by 2050, the emissions budget available per capita under the IPCC’s 1:5\u000eC target will be swallowed entirely by diets high in ruminant animals (Ritchie et al., 2018). Dietary change will be forced by environmental and economic factors, and the food equity gap will widen (Garnett, 2013), meaning the developed world must adapt diets compatible with a “1:5\u000eworld” (Schleusnner et al., 2016, p.832). However, by deﬁnition, ‘sustainable diets’ must not only have low environmental impacts, but be nutritionally complete, economically accessible, and culturally sensitive if they are to be widely adapted by society (Perignon et al., 2016; Macdiarmid & Whybrow, 2019). We must understand what drives food choice before we can strive to change it. To understand decisions around food fully, we need an holistic approach which considers a range of factors. For example, consider the apparent cognitive dissonance between desires to eat sensorially indulgent foods (Grac ¸a et al., 2015; Olsen, 2008; Armstrong Soule & Sekhon, 2018) and intentions to eat healthily (Pieniak et al., 2010; Perignon et al., 2016), or in ways that satisfy social norms (Bogueva et al., 2017; Carlucci et al., 2015; Abbots & Coles, 2013; Pohjolainen et al., 2015). Most existing studies investigate a single inﬂuence on food choice using explicit methods such as con- sumer surveys or focus groups (for recent examples, see Morales & Higuchi (2018) or Markowski & Roxburgh (2019)), but these explicit methods rarely capture crucial implicit inﬂuences, such as cognitive and emotional associations between different foods (K ¨oster, 2003; Dalenberg et al., 2014). In this paper, we investigate what we believe to be the currently little-explored dimension of implicit determinants of food choice. To do so, we assume that language can be used as a window into how people think and feel as shaped by culture and habitual behaviours - thus providing insight into both the explicit and implicit knowledge people have about foods. We then use Machine Learning methods for analysis; speciﬁcally a Distributional Semantic Model. DSMs are not only valuable for Natural Language Processing, but also for modelling human cognitive relations and semantic mem- ory (Jones et al., 2015). By examining the behaviour of food-word embeddings within this model, we are able to consider food choice as a mixture of explicit and implicit mental representations, \u0003Now at the Department of Computer Science, University of Shefﬁeld 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 rather than as the product of a single explicit factor. It is this data-driven approach that allows us to model how UK citizens implicitly think and feel about foods. 2 M ODEL AND STUDY DESIGN The basic design of our study was as follows: we deﬁned a set of food-words comprehensively representative of diets across the UK. We trained the Skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the ukWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2008), and studied the behaviour of food-word embeddings using unsupervised learning, bootstrapping of psycholinguistic variables, and close textual analysis. 2.1 C HOICE OF SEED WORDS We obtained a total of 925 food terms (including all variants in spelling, pluralisations and syn- onyms) by cross referencing Appendix R to the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (PHE, 2018b)1 with WordNet (Princeton University, 2010) and BBC Food.

Dietary change will be forced by environmental and economic factors, and the food equity gap will widen (Garnett, 2013), meaning the developed world must adapt diets compatible with a '1.5°C world' (Schleussner et al., 2016, p. 832). However, by definition,'sustainable diets' must not only have low environmental impacts, but be nutritionally complete, economically accessible, and culturally sensitive if they are to be widely adapted by society (Perignon et al., 2016; Macdiarmid & Whybrow, 2019). We must understand what drives food choice before we can strive to change it. To understand decisions around food fully, we need a holistic approach that considers a range of factors. For example, consider the apparent cognitive dissonance between desires to eat sensorially indulgent foods (Gracia et al., 2015; Olsen, 2008; Armstrong Soule & Sekhon, 2018) and intentions to eat healthily (Pieniak et al., 2010; Perignon et al., 2016), or in ways that satisfy social norms (Bogueva et al., 2017; Carlucci et al., 2015; Abbotts & Coles, 2013; Pohjolainen et al., 2015).\n\nMost existing studies investigate a single influence on food choice using explicit methods such as consumer surveys or focus groups (for recent examples, see Morales & Higuchi (2018) or Markowski & Roxburgh (2019)), but these explicit methods rarely capture crucial implicit influences, such as cognitive and emotional associations between different foods (Koster, 2003; Dalenberg et al., 2014). In this paper, we investigate what we believe to be the currently little-explored dimension of implicit determinants of food choice. To do so, we assume that language can be used as a window into how people think and feel as shaped by culture and habitual behaviors - thus providing insight into both the explicit and implicit knowledge people have about foods. We then use machine learning methods for analysis; specifically, a Distributional Semantic Model. DSMs are not only valuable for natural language processing, but also for modeling human cognitive relations and semantic memory (Jones et al., 2015). By examining the behavior of food-word embeddings within this model, we are able to consider food choice as a mixture of explicit and implicit mental representations, rather than the product of a single explicit factor. It is this data-driven approach that allows us to model how UK citizens implicitly think and feel about foods.\n\nMODEL AND STUDY DESIGN\n\nThe basic design of our study was as follows: we defined a set of food-words comprehensively representative of diets across the UK. We trained the Skip-gram algorithm (Mikolov et al., 2013) on the ukWaC corpus (Baroni et al., 2008), and studied the behavior of food-word embeddings using unsupervised learning, bootstrapping of psycholinguistic variables, and close textual analysis.\n\nCHOICE OF SEED WORDS\n\nWe obtained a total of 925 food terms (including all variants in spelling, pluralizations, and synonyms) by cross-referencing Appendix R to the National Diet and Nutrition Survey (PHE, 2018b) with WordNet (Princeton University, 2010) and BBC Food. Words with fewer than twenty occurrences in the corpus were removed in line with the 'Sinclair cut-off' (Baroni et al., 2008). Words with polysemic meanings of very high frequency (i.e., 'date', 'Turkey') were removed. Native English speakers were consulted over the removal of words of more ambiguous polysemy."
