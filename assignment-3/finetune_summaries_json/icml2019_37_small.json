Introduction Flooding is one of costliest natural hazards in the United States and globally, driving more insured losses than any other catastrophe (Aerts et al., 2014). Flooding in the mid- western United States during the spring of 2019 caused more than $1.3 billion dollars in structural damage and agricultural losses in Nebraska alone (Bacon, 2019).

Introduction\n\nFlooding is one of the costliest natural hazards in the United States and globally, causing more insured losses than any other catastrophe (Aerts et al., 2014). Flooding in the midwestern United States during the spring of 2019 caused over $1.3 billion in structural damage and agricultural losses in Nebraska alone (Bacon, 2019). Despite these impacts, understanding of floods in a climate context remains a major challenge, as does translating insights to actionable information for adaptation (Sharma et al., 2018). Climate-informed risk assessment frameworks for floods must consider changes in attributes of precipitation extremes, uncertainty in our understanding of flood generation, exposure, and vulnerability. Risk management requires a focus on development pathways, which should consider principled approaches to flood hazard management (including preventive measures, consequence management, and recovery), time-phased and flexible adaptation, and longer-term mitigation (Rosner et al., 2014; Ganguly et al., 2018).\n\nUnderstanding the link between climate change and changes in flooding has been named as a grand challenge for the hydrologic community (Sharma et al., 2018). Based on emerging success stories across multiple sectors, a recent climate action plan (Moss et al., 2019a, b) suggests broader use of machine intelligence, including artificial intelligence and citizen science, for hazard assessment and climate risk management. Techniques blending physics and data – physics-informed machine learning, machine-learning informed physics, and mixture of experts – have promise to combine the strengths of domain knowledge and insight from big data.\n\n2. A Vision for Flood Risk Management\n\nFigure 1 outlines a vision for leveraging machine intelligence for the advancement of climate-informed flood risk management. A risk management framework for floods under global change needs to consider key challenges in changing weather patterns, aging infrastructures and consequent vulnerabilities, and evolving attributes of urbanization and exposure. One challenge in predictive understanding of floods is estimating statistics of hydrometeorological extremes, which can translate to indices for risk-informed decision-making. Hybrid approaches blending physics and data sciences have shown value in extracting credible scientific insights from Earth System Model (ESM) simulations and translating insights to information relevant for adaptation (Ganguly et al., 2014; Vandal et al., 2017).\n\nGaps also exist in understanding of the integrated climate-water system and the complex physical processes that generate floods.

The climate case study (top left) extracts predictive insights about extremes (return levels of precipitation) together with uncertainty quantification from model simulations and remotely sensed observations.
