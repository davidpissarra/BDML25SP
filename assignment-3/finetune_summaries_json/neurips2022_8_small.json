Errors in the model can originate from unresolved phenomena due to a low numerical resolution, as well as misrepresentations of physical phenomena or boundaries (e.g., orography). Therefore, such models lead to inaccurate short–term forecasts of weather and extreme events, and more importantly, long term climate projections. While cali- bration methods have been introduced to address for parametric uncertainties, e.g., by better estimation of system parameters from observations, addressing structural uncertainties, especially in an interpretable manner, remains a major challenge. Therefore, with increases in both the amount and frequency of observations of the Earth system, algorithmic innovations are required to identify interpretable representations of the model errors from observations. We introduce a ﬂexible, general-purpose framework to discover interpretable model errors, and show its performance on a canonical prototype of geophysical turbulence, the two–level quasi–geostrophic system. Accordingly, a Bayesian sparsity–promoting regression framework is proposed, that uses a library of kernels for discovery of model errors. As calculating the library from noisy and sparse data (e.g., from observations) using convectional techniques leads to interpolation errors, here we use a coordinate- based multi–layer embedding to impute the sparse observations. We demonstrate the importance of alleviating spectral bias, and propose a random Fourier feature layer to reduce it in the proposed embeddings, and subsequently enable an accu- rate discovery. Our framework is demonstrated to successfully identify structural model errors due to linear and nonlinear processes (e.g., radiation, surface friction, advection), as well as misrepresented orography. 1 Introduction Numerical models are the core of modern weather and climate predictions. Despite their success in both short–term weather and long–term climate predictions, they are inundated with a slew of heuristics, and often suffer from high uncertainties. Such uncertainties lead to a range of low conﬁdence estimates in the predicted state variables [ 1]. Current efforts in expanding the resolution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.and frequency of the observations has provided us with a unique opportunity to learn the missing components of our models, i.e., model discrepancy, model inadequacy, or hereafter, model error. Although aritiﬁcial neural network (ANN)-based and statistical error correction schemes have shown great promise [ 2–5], they are not interpretable, and therefore cannot be reliably used to correct climate models. Growing availability of observation data has provided us with a unique opportunity to learn closed– form expressions of model errors. Such discoveries are expected to lead to generalizable correction of operational models, which are the backbones of any actionable policies. Although algorithmic plausibility of such frameworks are demonstrated for canonical chaotic ﬂows [ 6,7], other challenges have to be addressed. In this paper, we focus on scaling such methods to multi–scale turbulent ﬂows, and representing sparse observation. In this work, we scale MEDIDA, Model Error Discovery with Interpretability and Data– assimilation [ 7], a Bayesian regression to discover model error from a domain interpretable library of kernels generated by learning an interpolant of observed states. Our proposed approach is based on 3 main components, i) constructing the model error given a library of kernels, i.e., a system identiﬁcation problem, and ii) selecting a parsimonious combination of candidates for an expressive model, i.e., a regression problem, and iii) data imputation to account for the missing observations using a coordinate-based multi-layer perceptron (MLP), i.e., an MLP-based compressed sensing problem. Our main contributions are twofold, i) we demonstrate the use of Bayesian regression to discover parsimonious, closed–form and interpretable model error in two-layer quasi–geostrophic (QG) system, as a simple climate model [ 8], and ii) we delineate spectral bias as the principle challenge of using ANNs in modeling of turbulent ﬂows, and propose the use of random Fourier Feature (RFF) layer to effectively embed a highly multi–scale turbulent ﬂow for the purpose of equation discovery in climate applications. 2 Preliminaries Discovery of Model Error Consider a nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE), @tw(x;t) = g(w(x;t)), in a continuous domain, where w(x;t)is the state variable in a spatiotemporal domain. We assume the governing operator, g(w(x;t)), is unknown. Moreover, we assume to have a model of the truth, i.e., @tw(x;t) =f(w(x;t)). Our goal is to ﬁnd an interpretable model of error,h(w(x;t)) :=g(w(x;t))\u0000f(w(x;t)), such that the corrected model, i.e., @tw(x;t) = f(w(x;t)) +h(w(x;t)), can represent the true system more accurately\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
