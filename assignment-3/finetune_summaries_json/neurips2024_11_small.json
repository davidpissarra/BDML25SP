Supported by both Py- Torch and JAX implementation, the benchmark models an intertemporal social dilemma where companies balance short-term profit losses from climate mitigation efforts and long-term benefits from reducing climate risk, while ESG-conscious investors attempt to influence corporate behavior through their investment deci- sions, in a scalable and hardware-accelerated manner. Companies allocate capital across mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, with varying strategies influencing climate outcomes and investor preferences. Our experiments show that without ESG-conscious investors with sufficient capital, corporate mitigation efforts remain limited under the disclosure mandate. However, when a critical mass of investors prioritizes ESG, corporate cooperation increases, which in turn reduces climate risks and enhances long-term financial stability. Additionally, providing more information about global climate risks encourages companies to invest more in mitigation, even without investor involvement. Our findings align with empirical research using real-world data, highlighting MARL’s potential to inform policy by providing insights into large-scale socio-economic challenges through efficient testing of alternative policy and market designs. 1 Introduction Climate change poses a persistent threat to the natural ecosystem and the global economy. Addressing climate change requires coordinated efforts, particularly from large corporations, which are reportedly responsible for over 70% of global industrial greenhouse gas emissions [ 32]. However, emissions mitigation presents a social dilemma [ 40], where the benefits of reduced emissions are shared globally, but the cost of reducing emissions reduces profits for individual companies [48, 15, 8]. As corporations are inherently self-interested, they are unlikely to reduce emissions voluntarily without external incentives or regulations. Numerous policies have been proposed to address this challenge, among which mandatory Envi- ronmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosure has recently ignited a vigorous global debate. The Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposal, which would require publicly traded companies to disclose climate-related risks and greenhouse gas emissions, attracted over 15,000 comments, making it one of the most contentious proposals in the SEC’s history [ 56,13]. This intense debate has led to an indefinite delay in the proposal’s implementation [ 55]. Similar delays Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: TheInvestESG Environment. Corporations choose how much to invest in mitigating emissions, which affects their ESG Score. Climate-conscious investors can see ESG Scores when deciding how much to invest in each company. However, companies can engage in greenwashing to inexpensively and falsely improve ESG scores without actually mitigating climate change. InvestESG is a social dilemma, where selfish, profit-motivated corporations will not invest in mitigation without further incentives, leading to increased climate risks and decreased global wealth. are also unfolding in the European Union and Korea [ 6,38]. This highlights the need for thorough research to effectively inform the design and implementation of these policies. Traditional economics and policy research relies on either empirical analysis—which does not enable testing possible new policies [ 21,42,39]—or theoretical economics models, which are often limited to scenarios with only two agents (e.g., Friedman et al. 29), or single-period games (e.g., Pástor et al. 50). In contrast, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables simulating complex interactions between multiple agents over extended time periods, under diverse hypothesized policy settings. Leveraging MARL to address large-scale socio-economic questions is a growing field [ 33]. Prior work has demonstrated the potential of MARL to design effective taxation schemes that enhance both equality and productivity [66], highlighting its relevance for tackling social challenges. We propose using multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) to explore the impact of the ESG disclosure policy. We introduce InvestESG, an open-source MARL benchmark, to examine how profit-driven corporations balance short-term profits with long-term climate investments and whether ESG-informed investor choices influence corporate behavior. The simulation involves two agent types: companies and investors. Companies allocate funds to mitigation, greenwashing, and resilience, while investors choose investment portfolios based on their preferences for financial returns and ESG benefits. Our experiments with a state-of-the-art MARL implementation yield findings that align with real-world empirical evidence and provide novel insights. More broadly, we demonstrate the potential of using a MARL framework to inform policy debates in the field of climate change. Our aim is not to claim that our model fully represents real-world complexity. It remains a \"first-principles\" model; however, it captures aspects that are challenging to integrate into a single framework using traditional economic approaches. To further improvement our environment setup to accommodate different use cases, we plan to seek advice from climate change research experts within the CCAI community. We present InvestESG as a challenging benchmark for the machine learning community; for researchers that are interested in developing MARL algorithms that can solve social dilemmas, InvestESG represents a social dilemma environment that could inform policymaking.
