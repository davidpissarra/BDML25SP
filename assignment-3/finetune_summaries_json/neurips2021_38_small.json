Across prior work on machine learning for geophysical imaging, different choices are made about what data to pretrain on, and the impact of these choices on model performance is unclear. To address this, we systematically explore various settings of transfer learning for cloud classiﬁcation, cloud segmentation, and aurora classiﬁcation. We pretrain on different source datasets, including the large ImageNet dataset as well as smaller geophysical datasets that are more similar to the target datasets. We also experiment with multiple transfer learning steps where we pretrain on more than one source dataset. Despite the smaller source datasets’ similarity to the target datasets, we ﬁnd that pretraining on the large, general-purpose ImageNet dataset yields signiﬁcantly better results across all of our experiments. Transfer learning is especially effective for smaller target datasets, and in these cases, using multiple source datasets can give a marginal added beneﬁt. 1 Introduction As raw geophysical data is collected in ever-increasing volumes, there is a need for automated tools to extract useful information to better understand and monitor climate change. Machine learning has the potential to help us analyze climate data accurately, quickly, and at ﬁner spatiotemporal scales than standard methods [ 2,3]. For example, there has been signiﬁcant recent interest in using computer vision models to classify cloud types from images [ 11,27,28]. The presence of different types of clouds has important implications for climate change because clouds have diverse impacts on radiative forcing: certain cloud structures enhance warming by trapping heat, while others mitigate warming by reﬂecting heat away [ 4]. With complex feedbacks between cloud characteristics and warming surface temperatures, clouds play a vital role in the sensitivity of the climate to changes in CO2concentration [ 6,16,26]. At the same time, the precise impact of clouds on climate change is difﬁcult to model [ 27]; the sixth IPCC assessment report on climate change states “clouds remain the largest contribution to overall uncertainty in climate feedbacks” [ 21]. Therefore, there is great utility in applying machine learning to automatically classify cloud images, allowing scientists to analyze clouds at ﬁner spatiotemporal scales and continuously monitor changes in cloud cover and its impacts on the climate. The success of machine learning depends on large labeled datasets such as the ImageNet dataset which contains over a million images scraped from the internet [ 8]. While raw geophysical images Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.are plentiful from ground-based and remote sensors, there is a relative dearth of labeled images: many academic datasets contain only hundreds or thousands of labeled images [ 3,9,18,28,30]. In situations where labeled data is limited, transfer learning can provide a simple and effective method of training accurate machine learning models [ 15,17]. This method involves ﬁrst pretraining a model on an auxiliary dataset known as the “source dataset.” Then the model is further trained on the “target dataset” of interest, a process known as ﬁnetuning. This allows us to transfer the patterns learned in the source dataset to augment the training of the target dataset. Transfer learning has been successfully used to train accurate machine learning models from limited labeled data for applications ranging from cloud classiﬁcation to weather forecasting to land use classiﬁcation to prediction of El Niño-Southern Oscillation events [ 3,13,20,24]. However, the use of transfer learning varies widely across machine learning models for geophysical applications. Some models are not pretrained on a source dataset [ 11,18], some are pretrained on the standard machine learning ImageNet dataset [ 7,20,30], and others are pretrained on task-speciﬁc source datasets such as other geophysical imaging datasets or simulated data [13, 24, 28]. We systematically evaluate how the choice of source dataset impacts transfer learning across three geophysical tasks: cloud classiﬁcation, cloud segmentation, and aurora classiﬁcation. We compare the accuracies of models with no pretraining, models pretrained on the general-purpose ImageNet dataset, and models pretrained on task-speciﬁc geophysical datasets (e.g. other cloud classiﬁcation datasets). Results are varied across prior work on evaluating pretraining in other domains from medical imaging to law texts: while pretraining on general-purpose datasets is common, sometimes similar results can be obtained with no pretraining or improvements can be gained by pretraining on domain-speciﬁc datasets [1, 19, 23, 29]. In the context of geophysical imaging datasets, we ﬁnd that transfer learning can signiﬁcantly improve the performance of the models, up to an increase in test accuracy of 10 percentage points.
