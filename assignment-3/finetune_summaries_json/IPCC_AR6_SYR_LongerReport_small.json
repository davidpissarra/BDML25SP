The assessment is undertaken within the context of the evolving  international landscape, in particular, developments in the UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change ( UNFCCC) process,  including the outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the  Paris Agreement. It reﬂects the increasing diversity of those involved in  climate action.  This report integrates the main ﬁndings of the AR6 Working Group  reports58 and the three AR6 Special Reports59. It recognizes the  interdependence of climate, ecosystems  and biodiversity, and human  societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close  linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem  health, human well-being and sustainable development. Building on  multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and  social sciences, this report identiﬁes opportunities for transformative  action which are effective, feasible, just and equitable using concepts  of systems transitions and resilient development pathways60. Different  regional classiﬁcation schemes61 are used for physical, social and  economic aspects, reﬂecting the underlying literature. After this introduction, Section 2, ‘ Current Status and Trends’, opens  with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing  climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate  change, and  its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of  adaptation and mitigation response options. Section 3, ‘ Long-Term  Climate and Development Futures ’, provides a long-term assessment of  climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic  58 The three Working Group contributions to AR6 are: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability; and Climate  Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change, respectively. Their assessments cover scientiﬁc literature accepted for publication respectively by 31 January 2021, 1 September  2021 and 11 October 2021. 59 The three Special Reports are : Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018): an IPCC Special Report on the impacts of global warming of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and related  global greenhouse gas emission pathways, in the context of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, sustainable development, and efforts to eradicate  poverty (SR1.5); Climate Change and Land (2019): an IPCC Special Report on climate change, desertiﬁcation, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and  greenhouse gas ﬂuxes in terrestrial ecosystems (SRCCL); and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019) (SROCC). The Special Reports cover scientiﬁc literature  accepted for publication respectively by 15 May 2018, 7 April 2019 and 15 May 2019. 60 The Glossary (Annex I) includes deﬁnitions of these, and other terms and concepts used in this report drawn from the AR6 joint Working Group Glossary. 61 Depending on the climate information context, geographical regions in AR6 may refer to larger areas, such as sub-continents and oceanic regions, or to typological regions, such  as monsoon regions, coastlines, mountain ranges or cities. A new set of standard AR6 WGI reference land and ocean regions have been deﬁned. WGIII allocates countries to  geographical regions, based on the UN Statistics Division Classiﬁcation { WGI 1.4.5, WGI 10.1, WGI 11.9, WGI 12.1–12.4, WGI Atlas.1.3.3–1.3.4 }. 62 Each ﬁnding is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of conﬁdence is expressed using ﬁve qualiﬁers: very low, low, medium, high and very  high, and typeset in italics, for example, medium conﬁdence. The following terms have been used to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result: virtually certain  99–100% probability; very likely 90–100%; likely 66–100%; more likely than not >50-100%; about as likely as not 33–66%; unlikely 0–33%; very unlikely 0–10%; and  exceptionally unlikely 0–1%.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nThe Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) summarizes the current state of knowledge on climate change, its widespread impacts and risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. This report is based on the peer-reviewed scientific, technical, and socio-economic literature published since the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. The assessment is conducted within the context of the evolving international landscape, particularly the developments in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) process, including the outcomes of the Kyoto Protocol and the adoption of the Paris Agreement. It reflects the increasing diversity of those involved in climate action.\n\nThis report integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports and the three AR6 Special Reports. It recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity, and human societies; the value of diverse forms of knowledge; and the close linkages between climate change adaptation, mitigation, ecosystem health, human well-being, and sustainable development. Building on multiple analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, this report identifies opportunities for transformative action that are effective, feasible, just, and equitable using concepts of systems transitions and resilient development pathways.\n\nDifferent regional classification schemes are used for physical, social, and economic aspects, reflecting the underlying literature. After this introduction, Section 2, \"Current Status and Trends,\" opens with the assessment of observational evidence for our changing climate, historical and current drivers of human-induced climate change, and its impacts. It assesses the current implementation of adaptation and mitigation response options.\n\nSection 3, \"Long-Term Climate and Development Futures,\" provides a long-term assessment of climate change to 2100 and beyond in a broad range of socio-economic contexts. The assessment is based on the three Working Group contributions to AR6: Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis; Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability; and Climate Change 2022: Mitigation of Climate Change. The assessments cover scientific literature accepted for publication by January 31, 2021, September 1, 2021, and October 11, 2021, respectively.\n\nThe report also draws on the three Special Reports: Global Warming of 1.5°C (2018), Climate Change and Land (2019), and The Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (2019). These reports cover scientific literature accepted for publication by May 15, 2018, April 7, 2019, and May 15, 2019, respectively.\n\nThe report uses a range of analytical frameworks, including those from the physical and social sciences, to identify opportunities for transformative action. The report also uses a new set of standard AR6 reference land and ocean regions, which are defined based on the UN Statistics Division Classification.\n\nEach finding in the report is grounded in an evaluation of underlying evidence and agreement. A level of confidence is expressed using five qualifiers: very low, low, medium, high, and very high. The report also uses a range of terms to indicate the assessed likelihood of an outcome or result, including virtually certain, very likely, likely, more likely than not, about as likely as not, unlikely, very unlikely, and exceptionally unlikely."
