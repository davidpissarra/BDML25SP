Climate change poses a risk to individuals whose livelihoods depend on the health of glacier ecosystems. In this work, we present a machine learning based approach to support ecological monitoring, with a focus on glaciers. Our approach is based on semi-automated mapping from satellite images. We utilize readily available remote sensing data to create a model to identify and outline both clean ice and debris-covered glaciers from satellite imagery. We also release data and develop a web tool that allows experts to visualize and correct model predictions, with the ultimate aim of accelerating the glacier mapping process. 1 Introduction Glaciers are a source of freshwater and are critical to the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region both ecologically and societally [ 1]. However, glaciers are continuing to shrink at an alarming rate and this will result in diminished freshwater ﬂow. This is likely to cause adverse effects for the benefactors of freshwater ﬂow from glaciers. Additionally, glacier shrinkage has been shown to be a signiﬁcant factor in the current sea-level rise [ 4]. This calls for effective and efﬁcient methods to map and delineate glaciers in order to monitor changes and plan integrated water resource management and glacial hazard and risk management. In such areas, remote sensing offers complementary information that can be used to monitor glaciers [13,12]. Remote sensing allows the estimation of parameters like snow cover, glacier elevation, and ice index over large geographical and temporal scales. Utilising this information, different automated methods of delineating glaciers have been developed. However, the efﬁcacy and accuracy of these methods are affected by cloud cover, highly variable snow conditions, and the spectral similarity of supra-glacial debris with moraines and bedrock [ 3]. These errors are somewhat addressed through the application of semi-automated mapping methodologies, which combine outputs from automated methods with manual interventions. However, this is labor intensive and time-consuming. Machine learning techniques can play a signiﬁcant and positive role in speeding the process up. We apply machine learning techniques to automate methods for glacier mapping from satellite imagery. We utilize semantic segmentation - a deep learning approach that performs pixel-wise classiﬁcation in images. Using the HKH glacier region as an area of study, we use available satellite imagery from Landsat and glacier labels provided by the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) - a regional intergovernmental learning and knowledge sharing center Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.serving the eight regional member countries of the HKH [ 2]. Using these resources, we develop an extensible pipeline, a dataset, and baseline methods that can be utilized for automated glacier mapping from satellite images. We also present qualitative and quantitative results describing properties of our models. Additionally, we deploy our models as a web-based tool to demonstrate how machine learning can complement, rather than supplant, existing workﬂows. 2 Study Area and Data Sources Our experiments are carried out on the HKH region. The HKH is also known as the Third Pole of the world as it consists of one of the largest concentrations of snow and ice besides the two poles. It constitutes more than 4 million square kilometers of hills and mountains in the eight countries of Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, China, India, Myanmar, Nepal and Pakistan. Glaciers have been periodically identiﬁed and classiﬁed by experts at the ICIMOD [ 2]. Glaciers are categorized as either clean ice ordebris-covered subtypes. The labels we use have been generated through a semi-automated pipeline based on hyperpixel segmentation. Historically, ICIMOD has used the eCognition software [ 7] to segment Landsat imagery into image objects deﬁned by a contiguous set of pixels with similar intensity value. Those hyperpixels that contain debris or ice glacier are then merged and downloaded for reﬁnement. The manual reﬁnement phase involves removing labeled regions that are not at plausible glacier elevations or which do not pass speciﬁed Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalised Difference Snow Index (NDSI) or Normalised Difference Water Index (NDWI) thresholds [8, 9, 6]. We release our data in the LILA BC repository. The input data come in two forms – the original 35 Landsat tiles and 14,190 extracted numpy patches. Labels are available as raw vector data in shapeﬁle format and as multichannel numpy masks. Both the labels and the masks are cropped according to the borders of HKH. The numpy patches are all of size 512\u0002512and their geolocation information, time stamps, and source Landsat IDs are available in a geojson metadata ﬁle. 3 Model Architecture and Methodological Pipeline The task of identifying and mapping glaciers in remote sensing images ﬁts well within the framework of semantic segmentation. We adapted the U-Net architecture for this task [\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
