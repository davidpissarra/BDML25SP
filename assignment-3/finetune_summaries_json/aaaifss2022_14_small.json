Recent work on time-lapse seis- mic monitoring of CO 2storage has shown promising results in its ability to monitor the growth of the CO 2plume from surface recorded seismic data. However, due to the low sen- sitivity of seismic imaging to CO 2concentration, additional developments are required to efficiently interpret the seis- mic images for leakage. In this work, we introduce a binary classification of time-lapse seismic images to delineate CO 2 plumes (leakage) using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Additionally, we localize the leakage region of CO 2plumes by leveraging Class Activation Mapping methods. Introduction According to the International Energy Agency and the In- ternational Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC 2018), there is a need for a 50 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to avoid an increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius of Earth’s average temperature. This can only be achieved by reduced dependence on fossil fuels, use of re- newable sources of energy and large-scale global deploy- ment of carbon reduction technologies such as carbon cap- ture and sequestration (CCS). This technology consists of collection, transportation, and injection of CO 2into an ap- propriate geologic storage reservoir for extended time peri- ods (tens of years). Especially, unlike other solutions, CCS is considered a relatively low-cost, long-term and imminent solution. However, potential CO 2leakage from the under- ground reservoirs due to pre-existing or pressure-induced faults poses risks (Ringrose 2020). Thus, it is necessary to de-risk CCS projects by monitoring CO 2plumes in order to accurately detect and predict potential leakages as early as possible. Time-lapse seismic monitoring has been introduced as a reliable technology to monitor the CO 2dynamics in the Earth’s subsurface during carbon sequestration (Lumley *These authors contributed equally.

In essence, sequential (i.e once every 6 month- s/year/...) seismic datasets, called vintages, are collected in the field over an area covering the storage reservoir. Then, each seismic dataset is inverted to obtain high fidelity im- ages of the subsurface over time (Arts et al. 2008; Ayeni and Biondi 2010; Yin, Louboutin, and Herrmann 2021). The evolution of the CO 2reservoir can finally be visualized by subtracting the seismic images between different points in time. However, due to the inherently weak and noisy ampli- tudes of the CO 2reservoir’s response in those seismic im- ages, detecting the presence of potential irregularities, such as in CO 2plumes, corresponding to a leakage is a challeng- ing problem. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a machine learning based detection method based on standard binary classification. Recently, numerous methods leveraging machine learn- ing have been introduced for the detection of CO 2leakage based on a simple artificial neural network (ANN) (Li et al. 2018a), and a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks (Zhou et al. 2019). While leading to accurate predictions, these methods usually rely solely on the field recorded data rather than the subsurface seismic images. Besides, practical considerations such as repeatability (the ability to record the data in the exact same way every year) hinders their appli- cability to real world cases. On the other hand, as we rely on visualizing the CO 2plumes in the seismic image, we can take advantage of advanced seismic imaging techniques designed for non-repeated seismic acquisition such as the joint recovery model (JRM) (Oghenekohwo and Herrmann 2017a; Wason, Oghenekohwo, and Herrmann 2017; Yin, Louboutin, and Herrmann 2021). Additionally, this imag- ing technique has demonstrated higher fidelity imaging than sequential seismic imaging allowing for easier detection of CO2leakage. We will show in the following sections that we can effi- ciently and accurately detect CO 2from realistic seismic im- ages recovered by JRM on\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
