Our findings are striking–current methods produce highly biased predictions towards specific geospatial locations. The specifics of the biases vary based on the data modality and hyper-parameters of the models. Hence, we hope that FAIR-E ARTH will enable future research to design solutions aware of those per-group biases. 1 Introduction Our planet exhibits phenomena that operate across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, from local microclimates with hourly fluctuations, to global climate patterns that evolve over decades. Capturing those dynamics is crucial for climate change monitoring and mitigation. Existing methods include observation-based networks on the ground and sea ( 18), satellite-based remote sensing (21), and more recently, computer-based climate simulations ( 10). However, all aforementioned approaches suffer from some combination of discretization error, modeling error, data inconsistency, and resource-intensive inference ( 1). By being able to learn nonparametric models from arbitrarily high-resolution, multi-modal data, AI–and in particular Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) (20)–offer an attractive and efficient alternative. The use of INR to learn the underlying physical dynamics of geospatial data has seen a rapid increase in interest ( 6). Such methods learn to encode the underlying generative process and representation of the data through an implicit function mapping coordinates to data realisations–through a Deep Neural Network (DNN) (11). However, all recent INR advancements emerge from improving average test performances, i.e., by assessing predictions’ quality over the entire Earth. This begs the following question: How reliable are current state-of-the-art solution when looking at specific sub-groups such as coastal land or islands? As INRs are being deployed increasingly for climate monitoring, it is of utmost importance to develop specialized evaluation suites to quantify the fairness of current solutions. This of course is practically motivated: for tasks like natural disaster risk assessment where consequences are severe, there is a natural emphasis on improving worst-case performance rather than average-case metrics (15).

Upon a rigorous evaluation of state-of-the-art INRs against FAIR-E ARTH, we obtain the following striking observations: 1. “localized” groups such as coasts and islands are left behind (Fig. 6, Table 3) 2. global performance is negatively correlated to island performance (Fig. 10) 3. per-group performance can not be competitive on all sub-groups concurrently (Fig. 9).

Throughout our study, we focus on the latest state-of-the-art INR model developed by [19]. The model introduces a novel integration of SPHERICAL HARMONIC location embeddings with SirenNets [20], demonstrating consistently superior performance over earlier location encodings such as GRID and THEORY in various ablation studies [2, 17]. The crux of this procedure lies in the decomposition of the underlying signal, e.g., land boundaries, temperature, as continuous signals on the globe f: (λ, ϕ) → R. Specifically, for well-behaved functions, e.g., with exponential decay of their eigenvalues, the following decomposition can precisely recover the original signal:\n\nf(λ, ϕ) = ∑∞ l=0 ∑ m=-l w_l Y_l^m(λ, ϕ)\n\nwhere Y is the class of spherical harmonic functions, w_l are learnable scalar weights, and l and m are the degrees and orders of the basis functions Y_l^m. In practice, we impose an upper bound on l, effectively capping the representable frequency. This equation can be seen as a \"linear\" network with weight w. INR then extends this formulation by enabling the weighting of Y_l^m(λ, ϕ) to be a nonlinear function (DNN) of l and m; we direct the reader to the Appendix."
