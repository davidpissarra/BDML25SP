However, its utility in flood situations is limited by cloud cover and during nighttime. An alternative method for flood detection involves using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. Despite SAR’s advantages over EO in these situations, it has a significant drawback: human analysts often struggle to interpret SAR data. This paper proposes a novel framework, Diffusion-based SAR-to-EO Image Translation (DSE). The DSE framework converts SAR images into EO-like imagery, thereby enhancing their interpretability for human analysis. Experimental results on the Sen1Floods11 and SEN12-FLOOD datasets confirm that the DSE framework provides enhanced visual information and improves performance in all flood segmentation tests. 1 Introduction Under global warming conditions, the intensity and frequency of heavy precipitation and associated flooding events have increased in most regions [ 1,6]. It is important to decide where to deploy the necessary resources to mitigate the damage and quickly recover. Here, allocating needed resources relies on precise information collected manually and remotely. Herein, Electro-Optical (EO) satellites have provided a broad and comprehensive view of the disaster- stricken region, surpassing the scope of on-site surveys by humans. Satellite-based indexes, such as the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) ([ 5]), monitor the water bodies and delineate the flood extent. However, in EO observations, cloud cover obstructs the view of the region. It is because the sensors of EO satellites cannot penetrate clouds, but most flood events are due to heavy rains accompanied by thick clouds. Thus, the EO satellites are not suitable for accurate flood monitoring. As an alternative, approaches that employ Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observation have been proposed ([ 7]). SAR imaging holds the advantage of being unaffected by cloud cover and nighttime conditions, providing a flexible practice for disaster. However, SAR images often contain impediments to interpretation, such as speckle noise. Hence, although a model appropriately estimates the inundated regions, people cannot easily be reliable without EO imagery. To solve these problems, we propose the Diffusion-based SAR-to-EO Image Translation (DSE) framework, a novel method to generate synthetic EO (SynEO) images from SAR inputs for help flood monitoring. ∗corresponding author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Synthetic EOSentinel-1SAR (VV, VH) 𝑰𝑺(𝑪×𝑯×𝑾)Preprocessing𝐸𝑛𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐸!𝐷𝑒𝑐𝑜𝑑𝑒𝑟𝐷\"Latent𝐿&Latent𝐿'𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛𝐵𝑟𝑖𝑑𝑔𝑒Reverse ProcessHuman Analysis FloodInundationArea 𝑍!
