The motivation for testing the two classes of ML models is to allow the CNN to leverage information related to teleconnections and the RNN to leverage long-term historical temporal signals. The ML models boast improved accuracy of long-range temperature forecasts up to a lead time of 30 weeks for PCC and up 52 weeks for RMSESS, however only for select locations. Further iteration is required to ensure the ML models have value beyond regions where the climatology has a noticeably reduced correlation skill, namely the tropics. 1 Introduction Climate change as a result of global warming is a pressing international problem. Concerns are mounting over the signiﬁcant changes in the variability and extremes of weather, with an increasing possibility of catastrophes from the activation of tipping points in the earth’s climate system [ 1,2]. There is therefore an increased interest in accurate long-range seasonal forecasts of key climate variables such as surface temperature and precipitation given their relevance to developing strategies that mitigate anticipated seasonal impacts on various sectors, including disaster risk reduction and prevention [3]. Numerical climate models (NCMs) have a long history of being used to produce accurate weather and climate predictions, albeit at the cost of running large and expensive physics-based simulations (e.g. [ 4, 5]). The focus of this work is to investigate how convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks can be applied to seasonal forecasting of 2m temperature in lieu of NCMs, and if they are capable of improving upon a generally accepted benchmark that is the 30-year climatology. Previous works [ 6,7,8,9] have shown that these data-driven approaches can perform adequately with respect to physics-based simulations and, in certain cases, surpass them to some extent. For example, [9] developed a CNN model with consistently superior all-season correlation skill ( >0:5) when compared to a state of the art dynamical model (SINTEX-F) [ 5] for predicting the Nino3.4 index for lead times of up to 17 months. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9 PCC 1 2 3 4 MAEFigure 1: Left: A global map of the PCC calculated between the ERA5 reanalysis data and the 30-year standard climatology for 2m-temperature.

The ML models show improved accuracy for long-range temperature forecasts, up to 30 weeks for the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (PCC) and up to 52 weeks for the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), but only for select locations. Further iteration is required to ensure the ML models have value beyond regions with reduced correlation skill, particularly in the tropics.\n\nClimate change due to global warming is a pressing international issue.
