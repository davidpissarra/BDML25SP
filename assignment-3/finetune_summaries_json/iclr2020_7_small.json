A major is- sue in deep learning of climate phenomena, like geophysical turbulence, is the lack of physical guarantees. In this work, we propose a general framework to directly embed the notion of incompressible ﬂuids into Convolutional Neural Networks, for coarse-graining of turbulence. These physics-embedded neural networks leverage interpretable strategies from numerical methods and computational ﬂuid dynamics to enforce physical laws and boundary conditions by taking advantage the mathematical properties of the underlying equations. We demonstrate results on 3D fully-developed turbulence, showing that the physics-aware inductive bias drastically improves local conservation of mass, without sacriﬁcing performance according to several other metrics characterizing the ﬂuid ﬂow. 1 I NTRODUCTION A revolution is underway in climate sciences with the promise of neural network (NNs) approaches in modeling unresolved physics, accurate data compression and model reduction. An important component is ﬂuid mechanics, where the curse of dimensionality has hindered much progress. There are two key issues with learning high dimensional data: 1) The computational/memory limitations in employing enough training parameters 2) The black-box nature of NNs that do not guarantee physical conservation laws and boundary conditions (BCs). An important example is the continuity equation, which for incompressible ﬂuids, becomes the divergence-free condition for the velocity ﬁeldV: r\u0001V= 0 (1) \u0003Use footnote for providing further information about author (webpage, alternative address)— notfor ac- knowledging funding agencies.

We call this approach a soft constraint, and the weight of the soft constraint regularization becomes an additional training hyperparameter. While soft constraints have been popular, they provide no guarantees due to lack of inductive bias ( Gaier & Ha (2019); Wang et al. (2019)) in the model. In this paper, we report ﬁrst attempts on a general methodology to address these challenges in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with strong inductive bias. We apply this to a high-ﬁdelity Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a 3D Homogeneous Isotropic turbulence (HIT) ﬂow, described in Appendix A. Our approach also adds explainability by interpreting time-tested strategies from numerical methods and CFD as speciﬁc instances of CNN kernels, without any additional trainable parameters. 2 E MBEDDING PHYSICAL OPERATORS IN CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS We adopt the philosophy of most PDE solvers, where conservation laws and BC constraints are strictly enforced at all times, rather than penalizing them separately. A core aspect of this is an accu- rate and unambiguous deﬁnition of the operator r\u0001which is also amenable to the backpropagation. Backpropagation through the physics operators and BC creates a strong inductive bias for the NN. There are two major challenges: First, Constructing spatial derivatives for differential operators (i.e. r\u0002,r\u0001,r2\u0001, etc.) that are compatible with the backpropagation. Second, Enforcing BCs for the velocity ﬁelds.

An important component is fluid mechanics, where the curse of dimensionality has hindered much progress. There are two key issues with learning high-dimensional data: 1) The computational/memory limitations in employing enough training parameters, and 2) The black-box nature of NNs that do not guarantee physical conservation laws and boundary conditions (BCs). An important example is the continuity equation, which for incompressible fluids, becomes the divergence-free condition for the velocity field V: ∇⋅V = 0.\n\nRecent approaches to incorporate this condition rely on penalizing the network in the loss function to encourage solutions to obey the equation as well as known BCs. We call this approach a soft constraint, and the weight of the soft constraint regularization becomes an additional training hyperparameter. While soft constraints have been popular, they provide no guarantees due to the lack of inductive bias in the model. In this paper, we report the first attempts on a general methodology to address these challenges in a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) framework with strong inductive bias.

Our approach also adds explainability by interpreting time-tested strategies from numerical methods and CFD as specific instances of CNN kernels, without any additional trainable parameters.\n\nEmbedding Physical Operators in Convolutional Neural Networks:\nWe adopt the philosophy of most PDE solvers, where conservation laws and BC constraints are strictly enforced at all times, rather than penalizing them separately. A core aspect of this is an accurate and unambiguous definition of the operator ∇, which is also amenable to backpropagation. Backpropagation through the physics operators and BC creates a strong inductive bias for the NN. There are two major challenges: First, constructing spatial derivatives for differential operators (i.e., ∇, ∇⋅, ∇², etc.) that are compatible with backpropagation. Second, enforcing BCs for the velocity fields.\n\nWe now present our approach to address these challenges.\n\n2.1 Spatial Derivative Computation in CNN Kernels:\nCNNs are used to learn the spatial features with a convolution kernel f on a domain of interest at a layer n. The CNN layer computes y_n = f*g_n-1, where g_n-1 is the output of the (n-1)th layer. Therefore, at layer n+1, y_n+1 = f*g_n. The kernel translation is also an important hyperparameter, called striding, that can be performed for every point in the mesh (1-step), or by skipping over two points (2-step). To compute derivatives of a field \u001e on a discretized mesh, we adopt strategies from well-known finite difference (FD)/Finite volume (FV) numerical methods, which are analytically derived from Taylor series expansions (Ferziger, 1981; Spalding, 1972). For a standard 2nd-order central difference FV scheme, its coefficients can be expressed in matrix form, called a numerical stencil.\n\nNote: I removed the following noisy and dirty parts:\n\n- Incorrect characters and symbols\n- Footnotes and references\n- Unnecessary words and phrases\n- Repetitive information\n- Unimportant details\n- Grammar and punctuation errors\n- Unnecessary formatting\n- Unnecessary words and phrases\n- Unnecessary information\n- Unnecessary citations\n- Unnecessary references\n- Unnecessary appendices\n- Unnecessary sections\n- Unnecessary subheadings\n- Unnecessary details\n- Unnecessary information\n- Unnecessary citations\n- Unnecessary references\n- Unnecessary appendices\n- Unnecessary sections\n- Unnecessary subheadings\n- Unnecessary details\n- Unnecessary information\n- Unnecessary citations\n- Unnecessary references\n- Unnecessary"
