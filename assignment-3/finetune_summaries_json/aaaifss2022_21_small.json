Ozone concentrations are affected by envi- ronmental factors, including temperature, which means that ozone concentrations are likely to change in future climates, posing increased risks to human health. This effect is known as the ozone climate penalty, and recent work suggests that currently polluted areas are likely to become more polluted by ozone in future climates. In light of recent stricter WHO regulations on surface ozone concentrations, we aim to build a predictive data-driven model for recent ozone concentra- tions, as a step towards more accurate ozone forecasting tools, which could be used to make predictions of ozone concen- trations in future climates. We use observational station data from three European countries to train a transformer-based model to make predictions of daily maximum 8-hour ozone. Introduction Ozone at the surface is a secondary air pollutant which is not directly emitted by anthropogenic activities, but formed in the troposphere via a series of photochemical reactions (Finlayson-Pitts and Pitts Jr 1997). Ozone air pollution is estimated to contribute to between 365,000 and 1,100,000 premature deaths worldwide annually (Murray et al. 2020; Anenberg et al. 2010; Malley et al. 2017; Silva et al. 2013), primarily by causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases (Kim, Kim, and Kim 2020; Filippidou and Koukouliata 2011; Sun et al. 2022). The impacts of ozone pollution have been linked to both long and short-term exposure to high ozone concentrations (Bell et al. 2004; Nuvolone, Petri, and V oller 2018). Ozone air pollution is both a global and local issue. Back- ground levels of ozone in remote areas routinely exceed guidelines set by the WHO, while local ozone concentra- tions can far exceed these guidelines. The WHO estimates that 99% of the world’s population live in areas where ozone concentrations routinely exceed guidelines (WHO and ECE 2021).

Ozone impacts vegetation by oxidative damage of cells (Ainsworth 2017). This damage leads both to consid- erable economic losses from reduced crop yields (Burney and Ramanathan 2014), and the potential for increased cli- mate change, as damaged vegetation has a reduced capacity to sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere (Ainsworth et al. 2012; Sitch et al. 2007). Effects of climate change on ozone Derived from the key processes controlling ozone, in-situ photochemical production and transport, we observe a num- ber of relationships between ozone and other variables, such as temperature (La ˜na et al. 2016) and meteorology. The con- tribution of each of these factors makes accurate prediction of ozone with numerical forward chemical transport models (CTMs) difficult. For example, large scale meteorological phenomena affect both temperatures and transport. The rel- ative contributions to ozone concentrations from the changes in temperature compared to the changes in transport are dif- ficult to ascertain, particularly at extrema. Furthermore, increasing temperatures under climate change are also expected to affect ozone concentrations dif- ferently across regions (Schnell et al. 2016). This effect is known as the ozone climate penalty (Rasmussen et al. 2013). It has been suggested that increases in temperatures will lead to increases in ozone concentrations in regions polluted with NOx, while in less polluted regions ozone is expected to de- crease (Bloomer et al. 2009; Rasmussen et al. 2013). Recent studies have suggested this effect is significant in tropical, forested regions (Brown et al. 2022). With higher temperatures we may expect increased con- centrations of chemical ozone precursors in the atmo- sphere, firstly by thermal decomposition of peroxyacyl ni- trate (PAN), a reservoir for NO x(Beine et al. 1997), which may stifle the impact of projected NO xemission cuts. There is also evidence that there will be increased NO xemis- sions from soil (Hall, Matson, and Roth 1996). Emissions of VOCs (also ozone precursors, e.g. isoprene) from vegeta- tion may also increase (Lathiere et al. 2005; Constable et al. 1999) due to changes in stomatal conductance with temper- ature (Niinemets and Reichstein 2003).Considerable damage to human health from ozone comes from short-term exposure to high ozone levels\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
