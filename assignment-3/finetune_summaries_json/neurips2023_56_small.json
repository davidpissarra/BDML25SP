SIBs can leverage the well-established manufacturing knowledge of Lithium-ion Batteries (LIBs), but several materials synthesis and performance challenges for electrode materials need to be addressed. This work extracts a large database of challenges restricting the performance and synthesis of SIB cathode active materials (CAMs) and pairs them with corresponding mit- igation strategies from the SIB literature by employing custom natural language processing (NLP) tools. The derived insights enable scientists in research and industry to navigate a large number of proposed strategies and focus on impactful scalability-informed mitigation strategies to accelerate the transition from lab to commercialization. Figure 1: NLP Pipeline : We implemented a sequential filtering and visualization pipeline, employing sentence classification [ 1], phrase-level classification, and relationship extraction [ 2,3]. The outcomes are visually represented through BERT-based topic modeling [ 4] in Figure 3 and knowledge graphs in Figure 5. 1 Introduction Clean energy transition is crucial to mitigating climate change [ 5]. Energy storage devices, particularly compact chemical energy formats like batteries, are essential for managing the intermittent nature of renewable sources like solar and wind energy [ 6]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are the most common of all batteries today since they offer the highest energy density and output voltage compared to alternatives [ 7]. However, concerns have been raised regarding the skewed geographic impact of lithium extraction and the price impact of rapid growth [ 8]. The development of alternative battery chemistries, such as those based on sodium, could offer diversification opportunities [ 9,10,11]. Sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) can be good replacements for LIBs for grid storage. While SIB fabrication can parallel that of LIBs in terms of cell manufacturing and assembly [ 12,13], the commercialization 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023).of SIBs is lagging behind. This limitation predominantly stems from the performance and synthesis routes of cathode active materials for SIBs [14, 15]. Keeping track of developments can be complex as insights across material types are buried in an enormous corpus of >10,000 publications [ 16]. Therefore, it is vital to offer a coherent overview and an ability to efficiently query for researchers to develop these batteries. NLP-based studies in materials science in the last few years have focused on the extraction of quantitative synthesis related data and materials properties, enabling training of regressors for property related models [ 17,18,19,20]. In contrast to these studies that often omit the authors’ rationale and compel researchers to depend on model-generated interpretations of the data, our methodology focuses on capturing author rationale regarding cause-effect relationships for challenges. These are then aligned with the relevant mitigation strategies. This approach maintains a high degree of adaptability in the array of suggested solutions. We believe that the intentional focus of our method on textual references to materials engineering methods and mechanisms, rather than on quantitative data can enhance the understanding of existing approaches. Our primary contributions are as follows: • Detailed database on SIBs materials challenges and mitigation strategies •Interactive search tool for scientists to find SIB-related mitigation strategies and linked mechanistic causes corresponding to observed performance characteristics •Classifiers and training data for efficient battery literature screening, extendable to lithium- ion battery research Our novel approach utilizes a systematic extraction of challenges and mitigation strategies from the literature using a two-stage process that increases the accuracy and relevance of the information gathered. Moreover, this specialized focus on SIBs, which are a critical and emerging area in battery technology, fills a specific knowledge gap in the field. The interactive search tool not only aids in research but also in practical problem-solving, allowing for a more dynamic and user-friendly way to access complex information. Our methodology not only enhances the efficiency of literature review but also provides a scalable model that can be adapted to other areas of battery research. 2 Methods and Framework Figure 2: Senetence, Phrase and Relationship Extraction: The Sentence classification tag of this example sentence is \"Mitigation\". The phrases and relationships between phrases are identified in this annotated example. In recent years, there has been a significant surge in published research papers on SIBs to the order of 104[16]. It would take over 20,000 uninterrupted hours to manually read and comprehend every single paper, assuming an average of two hours per paper. However, our pipeline can efficiently process the entire corpus of scientific literature in just 6 hours, without requiring active human intervention. Recently, several fields have been trying to use visual maps to organize and analyze topics in text [21]. Our methodology drew inspiration from seminal works in sentence-oriented sentiment analysis [22,23,24], sentence-based search mechanisms [ 1,25], open information extraction [ 3,2], and topic modeling [ 4]. However, to the best of our knowledge, application of this scale of processing has not been developed for battery literature. We extracted a structured database, which enables us to identify prominent topics from an extensive breadth of topics\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
