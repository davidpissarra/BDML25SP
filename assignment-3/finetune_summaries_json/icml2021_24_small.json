Black carbon aerosols from fossil fuel burning for example have a warming effect by absorbing radiation and whereas sulphate from volcanic eruptions has a cool- ing effect by scattering radiation. Clouds strongly inﬂu- ence the earth’s radiation budget by reﬂecting sunlight and aerosols can change cloud properties signiﬁcantly by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). A higher concentration of aerosols leads to more CCN which, for a ﬁxed amount of water, results in more but smaller cloud droplets. Smaller droplets increase the cloud’s albedo (Twomey, 1974) and can enhance the cloud’s lifetime (Albrecht, 1989). Many climate models often consider aerosols only as exter- nal parameters, they are read once by the model, but then kept constant throughout the whole model run. In the case where some aerosol properties are modeled, there might be no distinction between aerosol types, and just an overall mass is considered. To incorporate a more accurate de- scription of aerosols, aerosol-climate modeling systems like ECHAM-HAM (Tegen et al., 2019) have been introduced. It couples the ECHAM General Circulation Model (GCM) with a complex aerosol model called HAM. The microphys- ical core of HAM is either SALSA (Kokkola et al., 2008) or the M7 model (Vignati et al., 2004). We consider the latter here. M7 uses seven log-normal modes to describe aerosol properties, the particle sizes are represented by four size modes, nucleation, aitken, accumulation, and coarse, of which the aitken, accumulation, and coarse can be either soluble or insoluble. It includes processes like nucleation, coagulation, condensation, and water uptake, which lead to the redistribution of particle numbers and mass among the different modes. In addition, M7 considers ﬁve different components - Sea salt (SS), sulfate (SO4), black carbon (BC), primary organic carbon (OC), and dust (DU). M7 is applied to each grid box independently, it does not model any spatial relations. More detailed models come with the cost of increased com- putational time: ECHAM-HAM can be run at 150km reso- lution for multiple decades. But to run for example storm- resolving models the goal is ideally a 1km horizontal grid resolution and still be able to produce forecasts up to a few decades. If we want to keep detailed aerosols descriptions for this a massive speedup of the aerosol model is needed.Emulating Aerosol Microphysics with a Machine Learning Replacing climate model components with machine learning approaches and therefore decreasing a model’s computing time has been shown to be successful in the past.

The aerosol cooling effect hides some of the positive radiative forcing caused by greenhouse gas emissions, and future restrictions to lower air pollution might result in stronger observed warming. Aerosols impact climate change through aerosol-radiation interactions and aerosol-cloud interactions (IPCC, 2013). They can either scatter or absorb radiation, depending on the particle's composition. For example, black carbon aerosols from fossil fuel burning have a warming effect by absorbing radiation, while sulfate from volcanic eruptions has a cooling effect by scattering radiation. Clouds significantly influence the Earth's radiation budget by reflecting sunlight, and aerosols can change cloud properties by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). A higher concentration of aerosols leads to more CCN, resulting in more but smaller cloud droplets, which increase the cloud's albedo (Twomey, 1974) and can enhance the cloud's lifetime (Albrecht, 1989).\n\nMany climate models often consider aerosols as external parameters, reading them once and keeping them constant throughout the model run.
