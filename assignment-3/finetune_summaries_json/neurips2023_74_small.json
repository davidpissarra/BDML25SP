However, the increased volume of satellite measurements cannot be fully leveraged due to computational bottlenecks. Here, we propose a data-driven architecture with Graph Neural Networks that emulates the outputs of LPDMs using only meteorological inputs, and demonstrate it in application with preliminary results for satellite measurements over Brazil. 1 Introduction Monitoring the accuracy of GHG emissions reporting is key to evaluate the efficacy of climate agreements and support data-driven policymaking. Following IPCC guidelines, countries report their emissions through national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs), aggregating activity data from sources and sectors together with country-specific emission factors. “Top-down” methods present an alternative approach, quantifying the movement of GHGs (GHG fluxes) using atmospheric observations. Incorporating real GHG measurements into the inference process enhances transparency and accountability in climate change mitigation efforts by independently verifying self-reported emissions, providing constraints on their uncertainties and identifying potential discrepancies. Within the methods for GHG flux quantification, the IPCC recommends inverse modelling systems in particular for comparing inventories against atmospheric measurements [ 1]. These models produce estimates of the spatial distribution of GHG sources from observations, using an atmospheric transport model and a statistical inversion framework. They have been used, for example, to evaluate methane emissions in Europe using in situ sensors [ 2] and in India using satellite measurements [ 3], and they were key to identifing the origin of unexpected CFC-11 emissions from eastern China [ 4], as well as being used annually by the UK and Switzerland to evaluate their own emissions inventories [5]. These inference systems mentioned above were originally designed for relatively small datasets using in situ measurements (thousands of global observations per month), but new satellite-based instruments have increased the volume of GHG measurements by several orders of magnitude (millions of measurements per day). This growth is causing severe computational bottlenecks for GHG flux inference systems, particularly those relying on backward running Lagrangian Particle Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Samples of LPDM-generated footprints (top row) and the corresponding emulated footprints (bottom row), for an area of size ≈3300×2500 km over Brazil. The date in each column and the red cross in the centre of each image show when and where the satellite measurement was taken, and the footprint indicates the area to which that particular measurement is sensitive to. Note the log 10scale. Dispersion Models (LPDMs) to solve for atmospheric transport. LPDMs simulate gas “particles” moving backwards in time from a GHG measurement location, producing a 2D histogram, known as afootprint, which indicates the upwind areas where emissions would contribute to the observed GHG measurement. To alleviate the computational requirements, existing approaches rely on approximating LPDM footprints mostly by interpolating from nearby footprints [ 6,7] or smoothing of lower resolution simulations [ 8]. Currently, only [ 9] have developed a proof-of-concept emulator that can output footprints solely from meteorology, and only [ 6] address directly footprints for satellite measurements, which are more complex to produce. In this paper, we propose a Graph Neural Network to output satellite footprints for any location in a domain using only meteorological and topographical inputs, without needing nearby footprints or further simulations for new measurements. Such a data-driven emulator could leverage the potential of satellite data, potentially enabling near real-time, global emissions inference, improving transparency and supporting countries without the necessary measurement infrastructure or computational resources to evaluate their emissions reports. We demonstrate and evaluate preliminary results for satellite measurements over Brazil, and describe further steps to impact. 2 Method Our data-driven approach to LPDM emulation is based on previous Machine Learning (ML) ap- proaches to meteorological forecasting, in particular [ 10] and [ 11], using message-passing Graph Neural Networks (GNN) in an Encode-Process-Decode architecture. Meteorological forecasting and particle dispersion simulations are closely related problems, sharing limitations and input data, but there are some key differences. One of the main changes in implementation with respect to traditional ML forecasting is that rather than using a fixed domain (i.e. the area covered by inputs and outputs is always the same), we choose a moving domain setup, where the latitude-longitude grid for the inputs and outputs is a square of side Scentered around the measurement location. Model The model is formed of three components, shown in figure 2: an Encoder, a Processor and a Decoder. Meteorological data and other variables like topography are arranged in a latitude-longitude grid, that represents the native data space. This data gets Encoded into an abstract mesh composed of equilateral triangles. The data is Processed in this abstract layer, and then gets Decoded back to the original data space, emulating the footprint value at each grid node.
