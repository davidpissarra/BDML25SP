Detection of floods from remote sensed imagery suffers from a widespread problem: clouds block flood scenes in images, leading to degraded and fragmented flood datasets. To address this challenge, we propose a workflow based on U-Net, and a dataset that detects flood in cloud-prone areas by fusing information from the Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 satellites. The expected result will be a reliable and detailed catalogue of flood extents and how they change through time, allowing us to better understand flooding in different morphological settings and climates. 1 Overview Floods are the most frequent and widespread natural disasters that can cause more than $40 billion in damage each year across the globe. Remote sensing images are commonly used in flood detection to map flood extent and indicate the probability of flood recurrence. In recent years, the Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) missions have received great interest for their potential to generate global flooding maps accurately from freely accessible data. The S1 Synthetic Aperture Radar constellation provides all-weather day-and-night imagery. S1â€™s shortcoming is that it detects water by identifying a smooth water surface, meaning that flood mapping under conditions that increase water roughness, such as windy and vegetated areas, becomes a challenge. The S2 mission can detect open water using the near-infrared band. However, it can only observe floods during the daytime and in cloudless areas. Extracting flood extents from S1 and S2 imagery traditionally uses thresholding to differentiate water from other pixels. This often introduces classification errors and requires manual adjustment. Recent advances show potential for the application of deep learning algorithms, especially convolutional neural networks (CNN), for enhancing flood mapping. This leads to our research question: Can deep neural networks be used in flood detection to leverage the complementary information from a fusion of data from the S1 and S2 sensors? Our project builds on a preliminary exploration using U-Net models for delineating the extent of floods. The preliminary results show that S1 data can supplement S2 data by improving flood mapping results to almost perfect accuracy in cloudless scenes.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy and dirty parts removed:\n\nFlood Detection from Remote Sensing Imagery: A Challenge and Proposed Solution\n\nFloods are the most frequent and widespread natural disasters, causing over $40 billion in damage each year globally. Remote sensing images are commonly used to map flood extent and predict flood recurrence. The Sentinel-1 (S1) and Sentinel-2 (S2) missions offer freely accessible data for generating global flooding maps. S1 provides all-weather day-and-night imagery, but its shortcoming is that it detects water by identifying smooth water surfaces, making it challenging to map floods in windy and vegetated areas. S2 can detect open water using the near-infrared band, but it can only observe floods during the daytime and in cloudless areas.\n\nExtracting flood extents from S1 and S2 imagery traditionally uses thresholding, which often introduces classification errors and requires manual adjustment. Recent advances suggest that deep learning algorithms, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNN), can enhance flood mapping. This leads to our research question: Can deep neural networks leverage the complementary information from a fusion of data from the S1 and S2 sensors for flood detection?\n\nOur project builds on a preliminary exploration using U-Net models for delineating flood extents. The preliminary results show that S1 data can supplement S2 data, improving flood mapping results to almost perfect accuracy in cloudless scenes. However, the most challenging task in flood mapping and detection is using deep learning algorithms to learn from S1 data when S2 data is not available.\n\nTo address this challenge, we propose a workflow that fuses information from the S1 and S2 satellites to detect floods in cloud-prone areas. The expected outcome is a reliable and detailed catalogue of flood extents and their changes over time, allowing us to better understand flooding in different morphological settings and climates.\n\nOur proposed workflow consists of four modules:\n\nModule A: Generating a dataset with accurate S2 water surface labels for both S1 and S2 image pairs, including cloudy and cloudless scenes.\n\nModule B: Generating normal water surface datasets.\n\nModule C: Training U-Net based models on the generated normal surface water datasets.\n\nModule D: Applying fine-tuned models to real flood scenes.\n\nWe intend to use this dataset to train U-Net based models and test their applicability to real flooding events. Our proposal addresses the problem of cloudy images inhibiting accurate flood detection and delineation.\n\nPrevious work has shown that cloudy images hinder accurate flood detection and delineation. Optical imagery (S2) can extract floods by calculating water indexes using water-sensitive spectral bands. However, this method is limited by the availability of cloudless scenes.\n\nOur research aims to explore the potential of deep learning algorithms, particularly U-Net models, to learn from S1 data when S2 data is not available. We will compare the performance of mono-temporal and multi-temporal datasets and examine whether adding temporal data can increase prediction capability. We will also evaluate whether models can learn better from context-based knowledge from flood-prone locations.\n\nWe will use the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS) and WorldFloods datasets to validate our results. Our proposed workflow is outlined in Figure 1.\n\nThe proposed workflow consists of four modules:\n\nModule A: Generating normal water surface datasets with cloudless S2 water index labels at T0 and cloudy S1 and S2 image pairs at T1.\n\nModule B: Generating normal water surface datasets.\n\nModule C: Training U-Net based models on the generated normal surface water datasets.\n\nModule D: Applying fine-tuned models to real flood scenes.\n\nWe will compare the performance of our proposed workflow with baseline models and examine whether our approach can improve flood mapping results."
