This has consequences for equitably minimizing wildfire risks to life, property, ecology, cultural heritage, and public health. Fortu- nately, decades of data exist for fuel populations, weather conditions, and outcomes of significant fires in the American West and globally. To benefit from this data, the fire management community needs data standardization and validation among many competing fire models. Likewise, the machine learning community needs curated datasets and benchmarks to develop solu- tions necessary to generate impact in this space. We present a novel dataset composed of 308 medium sized fires from the years 2018-2021, complete with both time series airborne based inference and ground operational estimation of fire extent, and operational mitigation data such as control line construc- tion. As the first large wildfire dataset with mitigation information, Burn Mitigation Dataset (BurnMD) will help advance fire projection modeling, fire risk modeling, and Artificial Intelligence-generated land management policies. 1 Introduction Wildfires are naturally occurring phenomena that are an integral part of healthy ecological systems. However, uncontrolled fires, especially those near the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI), can pose a considerable threat to life and property and therefore must be mitigated or fully suppressed. Furthermore, there is growing concern among the scientific and firefighting communities that the effects of climate change will lead to increased intensity and severity of wildfires [1]. Due to the seriousness and complexity of the problem, updated modeling and mitigation techniques are necessary to combat it. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are potential techniques that can be applied to the topics of wildland fire modeling, forecasting, and optimized mitigation planning; however, these methods require large datasets representative of historical events. These datasets currently do not exist in this domain and data sources (including aerial sensor data, weather patterns, and effects of previous wildfires) are spread across multiple agencies with incompatible formats and often non-overlapping or misaligned spatiotemporal fire spread and mitigation tracking. Fire projection, or forecasting models, are essential tools in firefighting training, fire planning, risk modeling, and real-time incident response.

Newer models include CAWFE [3], ELMFIRE [4], and WRF-SFIRE [5]. These were developed by studying small, well-contained wildfires or physics-based simulations and were not explicitly validated against historical data. As climate change drives hotter and drier fire seasons, historical fire projection model strategies must be updated to account for emergent and novel fire behaviours. Additionally, fire disaster response is often a multi-jurisdictional and resource constrained problem which necessitates proper logistical distribution of firefighting and emergency assets that are robust to equipment failures and the realities of command. The lack of standardization among the agencies that collect wildfire data limits innovation. This work will serve as a standardized dataset that can be used in downstream efforts for modeling and predicting wildfire spread and mitigation techniques, enabling the greater wildfire community to validate and verify future modeling techniques in this domain. 1.1 Related Work Local and foreign governments have jointly invested in improved modeling techniques for predicting the occurrence and impact of disastrous events like tsunamis, hurricanes, and floods [6, 7, 8]. Modeling these events, which include machine learning algorithms [9, 10, 11], relies on access to standardized and verified data. Wildfire models, comparatively, are not updated, standardized, or verified across historical databases [12, 13]. Researchers have curated datasets for wildfire and fire events in the past [14, 15, 16], but little attention has been paid to the role human intervention plays in the progression of a wildfire. Without this, wildfire models do not represent the behaviour seen by fire managers, leaving the general population at a larger risk for loss of life, property, and ecology. This work contributes the first wildland fire dataset that includes community mitigation efforts. 2 Data Sources Wildfire reporting is fragmented across eight government agencies in the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), which adds complexity to the collection and dissemination of data. NIFC data is publicly available through their Open Data Site [17]. The datasets used in this work include: Final Fire Perimeters, Operational Mitigations, and Operational Base Camps and Water/Retardant Drop Sites. More information is in Appendix 6.1.1 and 6.1.2. To verify dates and add missing flight times in NIFC data, this work leverages Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), which are space\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy and dirty text removed:\n\nWildfires are a natural part of healthy ecological systems, but uncontrolled fires near the Wildland/Urban Interface (WUI) pose a significant threat to life and property. The effects of climate change are expected to lead to increased intensity and severity of wildfires. To combat this complex problem, updated modeling and mitigation techniques are necessary. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can be applied to wildland fire modeling, forecasting, and optimized mitigation planning, but these methods require large datasets representative of historical events.\n\nCurrently, datasets in this domain are limited, and data sources are spread across multiple agencies with incompatible formats and often non-overlapping or misaligned spatiotemporal fire spread and mitigation tracking. Fire projection models are essential tools in firefighting training, fire planning, risk modeling, and real-time incident response. However, these models have limitations, as they were developed by studying small, well-contained wildfires or physics-based simulations and were not explicitly validated against historical data.\n\nTo address this issue, a novel dataset, Burn Mitigation Dataset (BurnMD), is presented. This dataset consists of 308 medium-sized fires from 2018 to 2021, including time series airborne-based inference and ground operational estimation of fire extent, as well as operational mitigation data such as control line construction.

In contrast, wildfire models are not updated, standardized, or verified across historical databases. Researchers have curated datasets for wildfire and fire events in the past, but little attention has been paid to the role of human intervention in wildfire progression.
