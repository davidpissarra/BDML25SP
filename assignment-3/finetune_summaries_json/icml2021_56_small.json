Introduction Inclusion of clean energy in future grid to tackle climate change requires careful and systematic planning. Both re- newable energy and electricity demand have signiﬁcant vari- ability. This is because solar and wind energy are dependent on atmospheric processes and the seasonality of temperature is a key driver of variable demand ( 6). Peak demand in summer is not representative of the peak demand in winter months. As temperature increases, demand can be expected to increase to meet cooling needs. In regions with high electriﬁed heating, low temperatures will also increase de- mand ( 1). Additionally, as the earth continues to warm, this seasonal variability in electricity demand will be further ampliﬁed due to the additional temperature gradients intro- duced by climate change. The effect introduced by climate change on temperature is often confounded with the natural *Equal contribution1Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, USA2University of Michigan, Ann-Arbor, USA.

Introduction\n\nIncluding clean energy in the future grid to tackle climate change requires careful and systematic planning. Renewable energy and electricity demand have significant variability due to factors like solar and wind energy, which are dependent on atmospheric processes. The seasonality of temperature is a key driver of variable demand. Peak demand in summer is not representative of peak demand in winter months. As temperature increases, demand can be expected to increase to meet cooling needs. In regions with high electrified heating, low temperatures will also increase demand.

In addition to using long time series of load data to capture the complexities involved in planning a cleaner grid, it is also useful to understand the change in electricity demand as residential, transportation, and commercial sectors are rapidly electrified.
