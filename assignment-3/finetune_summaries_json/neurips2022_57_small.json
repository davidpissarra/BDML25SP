Investment in raising efficiency of appliances is among the most significant attempts to save energy. Ironically, introduction of many such energy saving appliances increased the total energy consumption instead of reducing it. This effect in literature is attributed to the inherent Jevons paradox (JP) and optimism bias (OB) in consumer behavior. However, the magnitude of these instincts vary among different people. Identification of this magnitude for each household can enable the development of appropriate policies that induce desired energy saving behaviour. Using the RECS 2015 dataset, the paper uses machine learning for each electrical appliance to determine the dependence of their total energy consumption on their energy star rating. This shows that only substitutable appliances register increase in energy demand upon boosted efficiency. Lastly, an index is noted to indicate the varying influence of JP and OB on different households. 1 Introduction Climate change is one of the greatest environmental challenge in today’s era. Increasing amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is among the crucial factors for this deterioration [ 1]. According to a 2021 report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) [ 2], there has been a significant rise in the concentration of GHG emissions since the pre-industrial period. Increased usage of energy, even in the form of electrical energy, has been one of the most contributing factors for the rise in GHG concentrations in the atmosphere [ 3]. Consequently, a vast amount of research has been conducted to engineer energy efficient technologies and consumer goods [4]. However, time and again, previous literature has shown a rebound effect of introducing energy efficient technologies. This effect is much more significant at the level of end consumers of such technologies. Herring and Roy [ 5] have shown that technological advancements modify the lifestyle and attitude of people. They further state that even if the product in itself consumes less energy per ∗Authors Contributed Equally †Corresponding Author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.unit time, an increased usage of it by the consumers nullifies/reduces the benefits. This is in coherence with the well-known Jevons paradox (JP), formulated by Stanley Jevons in 1865 [6]. It diminishes the expected benefit from the newer technology. Apart from JP, human psychology also plays a crucial role in defining their behavior/response to any change. Several researchers in the domain have claimed that people possess optimism bias (OB) [ 7,8]. It is a tendency of humans to underestimate negative events for themselves or from their actions. This raises a possibility that post adoption of energy efficient appliance, consumers might start to further underestimate the environmental impact of consuming the appliance and thereby increasing their demand for electrical energy. In short, it is deemed that people consume limited electrical energy primarily because of two main factors, namely, 1) monetary cost of electricity, and 2) environmental impact. Since the adoption of energy efficient technologies is expected to reduce both of these factors, electricity demand might increase corresponding to the effects of JP and OB, respectively. This intuition is validated at a macro-level in previous studies. Greening et al. [9] consolidated the results from previous research to identify the behavioural influences upon introduction of appliances with higher energy efficiency. The results showed a net increase in the electricity demand. In another national level study, Frondel [ 10] showed that the introduction of a more efficient technology influence the behavior of consumers for worse. More recently, Li et al. [11] showed that without proper policies, technological progress does not reduce energy consumption. Focusing on regional data, they further identified significant spatial variations in the rebound effects. Thereby further strengthening the requirement of more micro level analysis of rebound effects to identify the exact variations of JP and OB at the level of individual households and for different technologies. Every individual (or household) is different in terms of their lifestyle, level of education, and concern for environment. Thus, to make direct and concrete claims about the influence of JP and OB on their energy consumption patterns, we need to analyze the consumption patterns of each individual for both non-energy efficient technologies and energy efficient technologies in otherwise similar, yet parallel, universes. Since such data is not yet available, we need alternate measures to estimate the influence of JP and OB on consumer behaviour. Using a dataset of total energy consumption of different appliances, their energy efficiency ratings, and household characteristics, this paper uses machine learning to identify the appliances where rebound effects can be observed in the community as a whole. Additionally, an index is noted to estimate the varying influence of JP and OB on individual households. 2 Dataset and Pre-Processing The data was obtained from the 14thiteration of the residential energy consumption survey (RECS) program, 2015 [ 12].

One of the crucial factors contributing to this issue is the increasing amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
