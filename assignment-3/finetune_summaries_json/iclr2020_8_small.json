However, this risk could increase because the intensity of the El ni ˜no phenomenon will be greater in the coming years, increasing rainfall on the Pe- ruvian coast. In this paper, we present a novel methodology for detecting housing areas and agricultural lands in low-resolution satellite imagery in order to ana- lyze potential risk in case of unexpected landslides. It was developed by creating two datasets from Lima Metropolitana in Peru, one of which is for detecting dry riverbeds and agriculture lands, and the other for classifying housing areas. We applied data augmentation based on geometrical methods and trained architectures based on U-net methods separately and then, overlap the results for risk assess- ment. We found that there are areas with signiﬁcant potential risk that have been classiﬁed by the Peruvian government as medium or low risk areas. On this ba- sis, it is recommended obtain a dataset with better resolution that can identify how many housing areas will be affected and take the appropriate prevention measures. Further research in post-processing is needed for suppress noise in our results. 1 I NTRODUCTION The detection of landslides in satellite images has received great attention in recent years, due to its relationship with urban planning and land use. Based on the research of Wang et al [1], El Ni ˜no phenomenon will have greater intensity in the coming years, whose effects will generate landslides and ﬂoods in the South American Paciﬁc coastal area, but it is in Peru where the effects of this phe- nomenon have a greater socioeconomic impact due to its geographical location, poor urban planning and the activation of dry riverbeds1that had remained passive for years, as observed in 2017, when there was at least three hundred and seventy two thousand damaged homes, according to statistics from INDECI [2]. One of the ways to analyze this problem is to have information about the landslide susceptibility which it has received extensive research. Moayedi et al.[3] developed a hybrid model called PSO- ANN to create landslide susceptibility maps over the city of Kermanshah, Iran, and more recently Ghorbanzadeh et al [4] showed that convolutional neural networks of deep learning have better performance than traditional machine learning methods that use 4-band images from Nepal and China. In addition, there are datasets that contain land cover classiﬁcation and building footprint detection such as DeepGlove [5], EuroSat [6] and SpaceNet [7] that have promoted the development of different investigations related to semantic segmentation approach [8, 9, 10]. \u0003equal contribution 1Dry riverbed is a type of landslide which course is channeled, as shown in Figure 2, and in Peru it is common to ﬁnd constructions in the course of dry riverbeds as shown in Figure 3 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Although there are numerous approaches to the detection of landslides and buildings separately, none analyzes the direct relationship between ﬂoods or landslides in populated and agricultural ar- eas. In addition, there is no dataset available focused on Peruvian geography. So this is the main reason a novel approach is developed whose methodology consists in: (1) obtaining two correspond- ing novel datasets, the ﬁrst has dry riverbeds, risk areas and agriculture, while the second one has residential, human settlement and industrial areas; (2) the increase of the dataset that performs ge- ometric operations, as well as its preprocessing; (3) The selection of the appropriate deep learning method that can classify pixels; and (4) Fusion of results for risk analysis. Finally, discussion and future work that will be developed for this approach. 2 D ATASET AND EVALUATION METRIC The low resolution satellite imagery used for both tasks were collected by RapidEye satellite pro- vided by Planet Labs through its imagery exploration toolkit. This satellite imagery has 3-band natural color (red, green, blue) and a 5m pixel resolution. For the purpose of this research, the full dataset covers a total of 450 km2of our study zone: Lima, Peru. Each image has been labelled manually using LabelMe software [11] as the selected annotation toolkit. Each image is paired with a ground truth mask2, samples are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The masks are images with a total of 3 different classes and depend on the task. Task 1 is for detecting mainly dry riverbeds and agriculture lands and Task 2 for detecting types of housing areas, the descriptions of each class are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. We carefully annotated our dataset to avoid overlapping in the annotations and they do not always have all of the classes in one image. The annotations are not perfect due to the fact that many areas can be not seen\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

However, this risk may increase due to the expected intensification of the El Niño phenomenon, which will lead to increased rainfall on the Peruvian coast. This paper presents a novel methodology for detecting housing areas and agricultural lands in low-resolution satellite imagery to analyze potential risk in the event of unexpected landslides. The methodology was developed by creating two datasets from Lima Metropolitana in Peru, one for detecting dry riverbeds and agricultural lands, and the other for classifying housing areas. Data augmentation based on geometric methods was applied, and architectures based on U-net methods were trained separately and then overlapped for risk assessment. The results showed that there are areas with significant potential risk that have been classified by the Peruvian government as medium or low-risk areas. It is recommended to obtain a dataset with better resolution to identify the number of housing areas that will be affected and take appropriate prevention measures. Further research is needed to improve the results by suppressing noise.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe detection of landslides in satellite images has gained significant attention in recent years due to its relationship with urban planning and land use. Research suggests that the El Niño phenomenon will have greater intensity in the coming years, leading to landslides and floods in the South American Pacific coastal area, with Peru being particularly affected due to its geographical location, poor urban planning, and the activation of dry riverbeds. In 2017, at least 372,000 homes were damaged in Peru, according to statistics from INDECI. One way to analyze this problem is to have information about landslide susceptibility, which has received extensive research. A hybrid model called PSO-ANN was developed to create landslide susceptibility maps over the city of Kermanshah, Iran, and convolutional neural networks have been shown to outperform traditional machine learning methods in landslide detection using 4-band images from Nepal and China.\n\nThere are also datasets that contain land cover classification and building footprint detection, such as DeepGlove, EuroSat, and SpaceNet, which have promoted the development of semantic segmentation approaches. However, there is a lack of datasets focused on Peruvian geography, and most approaches analyze landslides and buildings separately without considering the direct relationship between floods or landslides in populated and agricultural areas. Therefore, a novel approach is developed to address this gap.\n\nMETHODS\n\nThe methodology consists of four steps: (1) obtaining two novel datasets, one for dry riverbeds, risk areas, and agriculture, and the other for residential, human settlement, and industrial areas; (2) increasing the dataset through geometric operations and preprocessing; (3) selecting the appropriate deep learning method for pixel classification; and (4) fusing results for risk analysis.\n\nDATASET AND EVALUATION METRIC\n\nThe low-resolution satellite imagery used for both tasks was collected by the RapidEye satellite provided by Planet Labs. The dataset covers a total of 450 km² of the study zone, Lima, Peru, with a 5m pixel resolution. Each image was manually labeled using LabelMe software, and a ground truth mask was paired with each image. The masks have three different classes, depending on the task, and are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5. The descriptions of each class are shown in Table 1 and Table 2. The annotations were carefully done to avoid overlapping and are not perfect due to the complexity of the task."
