The seller (i.e., the government) can choose a number of licenses to auction, and wishes to maximize societal welfare: the total economic value of the buyers minus the social cost. Motivated by emission license markets deployed in practice, we focus on uniform price auctions with a price ﬂoor and/or price ceiling. The seller has distributional information about the market, and their goal is to tune the auction parameters to maximize expected welfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected welfare achievable by any such auction under truth-telling behavior. Unfortunately, the uniform price auction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can signiﬁcantly reduce (even below zero) the welfare of a given auction conﬁguration. We use tools from theoretical computer science and algorithmic game theory to address the strategic vulnerabilities of these auctions. We describe a subclass of “safe-price” auctions for which the welfare at any Bayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate the welfare under truth- telling behavior. We then show that the better of a safe-price auction, or a truthful auction that allocates licenses to only a single buyer, will approximate the target benchmark. In particular, we show how to choose a number of licenses and a price ﬂoor so that the worst-case welfare, at any equilibrium, is a constant approximation to the best achievable welfare under truth-telling after excluding the welfare contribution of a single buyer. This provides a concrete recommendation for how to set the auction parameters in practice in order to achieve guarantees, even in the face of strategic participants. \u0003Supported in part by NSF CCF-1420381 and by a Microsoft Research PhD Fellowship.

Roughly speaking, a government agency distributes pollution licenses to ﬁrms according to some mechanism. At the end of a period of time (e.g., a year), ﬁrms must submit licenses to cover their pollution or else face severe penalties. Different ways of distributing licenses are possible. For example, if licenses are simply sold at a ﬁxed price to anyone who wishes to pay, then this is equivalent to a carbon tax where polluters must pay a linear fee to offset their emissions. Alternatively, in a cap-and-trade mechanism, the agency releases a ﬁxed number Cof pollution licenses, either via a pre-determined allocation at no price (e.g., based on prior pollution or industry averages) or via auction, and then polluters can trade these licenses on the open market. Many emission trading systems take features of both schemes, combining a cap-and-trade market with a price ﬂoorp, where each license must be sold above the reserve price of p, and/or a price ceiling p, where an extra license beyond the cap can always be purchased at a price of p. In general, such a pollution license market is referred to as an Emission Trading System (ETS). There are many important ETS in effect today. The EU ETS has thousands of participating ﬁrms and has raised billions of dollars in auction revenue over the past 10 years [ 2]. The Western Climate Initiative runs a license auction that is linked between California and Quebec [ 4,1], and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI, pronounced ‘Reggie’) serves New England and the New York region [ 3]. These markets differ in the details of their implementations, but in each case, licenses are distributed on a regular schedule, with a signiﬁcant quantity of those licenses sold at auction. One can model such a license auction as a multi-unit auction; that is, an auction for multiple identical goods. There is no bound on the supply of goods, but there is a cost of production corresponding to the social cost of more pollution. The social cost is typically assumed to be increasing and convex, and the value for licenses for each buyer is commonly assumed to be increasing and concave [ 27]. Each of the ETS described above uses a uniform-price auction rule to resolve this multi-unit auction. Such auctions proceed roughly as follows. Participating ﬁrms declare bids, as a non-decreasing concave function that describes their willingness-to-pay for varying quantities of licenses. This can alternatively be viewed as a list of non-increasing marginal bids for each successive license. Any marginal bids below the reserve price pare removed, and licenses are then distributed to the highest remaining marginal bids while supplies last. Each ﬁrm then pays a ﬁxed price pper license, where pis set to some value between the lowest marginal winning bid and the highest marginal losing bid. Such auctions are not truthful, but are common in practice due to\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nThe seller, typically the government, can choose the number of licenses to auction and aims to maximize societal welfare, which is the total economic value of the buyers minus the social cost. Motivated by emission license markets in practice, we focus on uniform price auctions with a price floor and/or price ceiling. The seller has distributional information about the market and aims to adjust the auction parameters to maximize expected welfare. The target benchmark is the maximum expected welfare achievable by any such auction under truthful behavior.\n\nUnfortunately, the uniform price auction is not truthful, and strategic behavior can significantly reduce (even below zero) the welfare of a given auction configuration. We use tools from theoretical computer science and algorithmic game theory to address the strategic vulnerabilities of these auctions. We describe a subclass of \"safe-price\" auctions for which the welfare at any Bayes-Nash equilibrium will approximate the welfare under truthful behavior.\n\nWe then show that the better of a safe-price auction or a truthful auction that allocates licenses to only a single buyer will approximate the target benchmark. In particular, we show how to choose the number of licenses and a price floor so that the worst-case welfare at any equilibrium is a constant approximation to the best achievable welfare under truthful behavior after excluding the welfare contribution of a single buyer. This provides a concrete recommendation for setting the auction parameters in practice to achieve guarantees, even in the face of strategic participants.\n\nLicenses for carbon and other emissions are a market-based policy tool for reducing pollution and mitigating the effects of climate change. A government agency distributes pollution licenses to firms according to some mechanism. At the end of a period of time (e.g., a year), firms must submit licenses to cover their pollution or face severe penalties. Different ways of distributing licenses are possible.\n\nFor example, if licenses are sold at a fixed price to anyone who wishes to pay, this is equivalent to a carbon tax where polluters must pay a linear fee to offset their emissions. Alternatively, in a cap-and-trade mechanism, the agency releases a fixed number of pollution licenses, either via a predetermined allocation at no price or via auction, and then polluters can trade these licenses on the open market. Many emission trading systems combine features of both schemes, combining a cap-and-trade market with a price floor, where each license must be sold above a reserve price, and/or a price ceiling, where an extra license beyond the cap can be purchased at a fixed price.\n\nIn general, such a pollution license market is referred to as an Emission Trading System (ETS).
