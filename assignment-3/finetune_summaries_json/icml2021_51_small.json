Introduction Quantitative projections of future climate change, with a robust estimate of their uncertainty, are critical to inform policy and decision-making. Earth System Models (ESMs) forced by emissions scenarios are the primary tool used to provide these projections, and modern ESMs incorporate sophisticated representations of Earth system processes, are physically self-consistent, show high ﬁdelity with obser- vations, and are computationally efﬁcient enough to run large ensembles (Kay et al., 2014; Danabasoglu et al., 2020; Gent et al., 2011). However, most ESMs participating in CMIP6 have spatial grid resolutions of O(100 km)on a side, which is often much too course to provide useful infor- 1Department of Geography and Environmental Management, University of Waterloo, Canada.2Department of Systems De- sign Engineering, University of Waterloo, Canada..

Limited-area versions of ESMs called Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are used to downscale ESM simulations to resolutions as ﬁne as 1 km, but this approach creates other problems such as physical inconsistencies between the driving model and RCM, scale mismatches at the lateral boundaries, and com- putational inefﬁciencies limiting ensemble size (Racherla et al., 2012; Luca et al., 2016). Statistical downscaling can be effective, but omits small-scale feedbacks and implicitly assumes stationarity in the downscaling model (Lanzante et al., 2018). Machine-learning based downscaling meth- ods may overcome some of these limitations (Beusch et al., 2020; Heinze-Deml et al., 2020). It is clear that the optimal solution is to build global ESMs at resolutions ofO(10km), but these models are computation- ally prohibitive to develop and calibrate (Sch ¨ar et al., 2020). Emulation offers an efﬁcient alternative, by using a simpler empirical model to learn the behaviours of a more complex dynamical model (Kennedy & O’Hagan, 2001). Modern statistical learning methods have enabled more sophisticated emulation of ESMs, however, most previous studies have focused on simpliﬁed outputs, either through spatial aver- aging (Fletcher et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2011), or by ﬁrst applying dimension-reduction methods like PCA (Salter & Williamson, 2019). Several studies have built emulators that represent the spatial structure of the ESM response; however, these tend to emulate one output variable at a time (Salter et al., 2018; Regayre et al., 2018). Here we present a novel application of a statistical learn- ing technique popular in computer vision to emulate global output from a higher-resolution ESM as a function of a relatively small number of input (calibration) parameters. We demonstrate that the emulator can be trained effectively using a combination of inexpensive lower-resolution exam- ples from the same ESM, and a relatively small number of high-resolution examples. The fully-trained emulator is able to accurately predict the impact of the calibration parame- ters on full global maps of a suite of seven output variables from the ESM, including precipitation. This represents a potentially signiﬁcant pathway to expediting the calibration process for future generations of higher-resolution ESMs.Efﬁcient calibration of Earth System Models (a)(b)(c) Figure 1.
