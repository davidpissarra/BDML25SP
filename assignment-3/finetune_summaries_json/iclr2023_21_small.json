Wilson ISAE-SUPAERO, University of Toulouse ABSTRACT Given the current context of climate change and the increasing population den- sities at coastal zones around the globe, there is an increasing need to be able to predict the development of our coasts. Recent advances in artiﬁcial intelligence allow for automatic analysis of observational data. Symbolic Regression (SR) is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that aims to ﬁnd interpretable symbolic expressions that can explain relations in the data. In this work, we aim to study the problem of forecasting shoreline change using SR. We make use of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) in order to encode and improve upon ShoreFor, a physical shoreline prediction model. During training, CGP individuals are evalu- ated and selected according to their predictive score at ﬁve different coastal sites. This work presents a comparison between a CGP-evolved model and the base ShoreFor model. In addition to evolution’s ability to produce well-performing models, it demonstrates the usefulness of SR as a research tool to gain insight into the behaviors of shorelines in various geographical zones. 1 I NTRODUCTION Coasts around the globe are continuously facing natural and anthropogenic pressures. Our knowl- edge and understanding of the evolution of the coastal zone over time is crucial for a large variety of applications including coastal risk monitoring and management. Shoreline evolution forecasting is an important element in coastal studies that aims to better understand and predict the occurrence and intensity of erosive and accretive forces. Recently, large efforts have been made to understand and predict shoreline evolution due to the rising social, economic and natural pressures such as climate change [1, 2, 3, 4]. Three main types of methods have been proposed and discussed in the literature on the topic of forecasting shoreline change [1]. Process-based models simulate multiple physical processes which contribute to shoreline change. The simulations are coupled through mass and momentum conserva- tion laws. Such models include MIKE 21 [5], Delft3D [6], ROMS [7] and CROCO [8]. In general, these models are used to model short-term local events in the nearshore zone and are not consid- ered applicable over larger spatio-temporal scales [1, 9]. Hybrid models are mixed approaches to modelling shoreline change that incorporate general physical principles and which are calibrated 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 using data-driven approaches (e.g. least-squares-ﬁt). These models can be used to predict shoreline position over much longer time scales, however they are generally unable to generalize to previously- unseen areas and conditions and require site-speciﬁc ﬁeld data for model calibration. Finally, data- driven techniques range from simple regression methods to modern deep learning models, which have demonstrated impressive capabilities over a wide variety of applications [10, 11, 12]. Arti- ﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN’s) are the most commonly used models in similar works employing AI for shoreline forecasting [13, 14]. While ANN’s have helped achieve signiﬁcant advances in many domains, explaining their predictions remains relatively difﬁcult due to their black-box nature [15, 16]. Symbolic Regression (SR) is a domain of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms that search for sym- bolic representations of the relationships embedded in the data. Evolutionary algorithms, and specif- ically Genetic Programming (GP), are often used for SR. GP operates by composing a predeﬁned set of functions in a tree, graph, or other structure; the composition of functions is determined by an evolutionary algorithm. As the optimized model is a functional graph or tree, GP is considered an in- terpretable ML technique that can be used to derive simple symbolic forms of relationships in data. GP has been demonstrated to be competitive with machine learning approaches such as gradient boosting [17] and has been applied to a wide variety of problems [18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. This work frames the problem of forecasting shoreline change as a data-driven symbolic regres- sion task. We make use of Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) [25] and the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) [26] to encode and evolve interpretable shoreline change models. To promote model generalization, the evolved models are optimized to maximize predic- tion accuracy at ﬁve different coastal sites from around the globe. Evolution discovers new shoreline forecasting models which are competitive with existing physical models across the ﬁve studied sites. 2 M ETHODS 2.1 S HORE FOR ShoreFor [27] is a shoreline change forecasting model that is built upon the principle of shoreline equilibrium [28], where shorelines continuously evolve towards a time\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe French Space Agency's Earth Observation Lab, in collaboration with ISAE-SUPAERO, University of Toulouse, presents a study on predicting coastal development in the context of climate change and increasing population densities at coastal zones worldwide. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence enable the automatic analysis of observational data. Symbolic Regression (SR) is a type of Machine Learning algorithm that aims to find interpretable symbolic expressions explaining data relationships. This work investigates the application of SR to forecast shoreline change using Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) to improve upon the ShoreFor physical shoreline prediction model. During training, CGP individuals are evaluated and selected based on their predictive scores at five different coastal sites. This study compares a CGP-evolved model with the base ShoreFor model, demonstrating the effectiveness of evolution in producing well-performing models and the utility of SR as a research tool to gain insight into shoreline behaviors in various geographical zones.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nCoasts worldwide face natural and anthropogenic pressures, making it essential to understand the evolution of the coastal zone over time for various applications, including coastal risk monitoring and management.
