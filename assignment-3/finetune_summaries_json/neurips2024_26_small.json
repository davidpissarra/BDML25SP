District Heating Systems (DHS), while contributing to carbon emissions due to the continued re- liance on fossil fuels for heat production, are embracing more sustainable practices albeit with some sense of vulnerability as it could constrain their ability to adapt to dynamic demand and production scenarios. As demographic demands grow and renewables become the central strategy in decarbonizing the heating sector, the need for accurate demand forecasting has intensified. Advances in digitization have paved the way for Machine Learning (ML) based solutions to become the industry standard for modeling complex time series patterns. In this paper, we focus on building a Deep Learning (DL) model that uses deconstructed compo- nents of independent and dependent variables that affect heat demand as features to perform multi-step ahead forecasting of head demand. The model represents the input features in a time-frequency space and uses an attention mechanism to generate accurate forecasts. The proposed method is evaluated on a real-world dataset and the forecasting performance is assessed against LSTM and CNN-based forecasting models. Across different supply zones, the attention-based models outperforms the baselines quantitatively and qualitatively, with an Mean Abso- lute Error (MAE) of 0.105±0.06kWh and a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 5.4%±2.8%,in comparison the second best model with a MAE of 0.10±0.06kWh and a MAPE of 5.6%±3%. 1 Introduction As the effects of climate change become increasingly pronounced, global policymakers are intensify- ing their efforts to combat these issues through climate-friendly policies [1]. A major focus of these initiatives is the pursuit of carbon neutrality by decarbonizing energy systems within sustainable energy frameworks. Despite progress in renewable energy technologies, fossil fuels still provide 50% of Europe’s primary energy, with 63% of the residential sector’s final energy consumption used for heating [2]. District heating networks have significant potential for decarbonization through the integration of renewable energy sources [3], underscoring the importance of precise heat demand forecasting methods. Such accuracy is crucial for efficient resource management, reducing energy waste, and facilitating the successful incorporation of renewables into existing energy systems. ∗Webpage: https://lme.tf.fau.de/person/ramachandran/ Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.With the growing proliferation of smart devices, time series modeling has greatly advanced, benefiting from the richer data streams and the progress in Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL). While these advancements have led to sophisticated models, such as attention mechanisms that enable a model to prioritize and focus on the most critical parts of the input data, traditional statistical methods like ARIMA and SARIMAX remain popular [4], [5], [6]. These methods are valued for their intuitive additive and multiplicative approaches, offering a level of interpretability that complements the complexity of newer techniques. As attention-based models [7], including transformer models for time series, Large Language Models (LLMs) with embedded context, and foundation models for time series forecasting [8], become more prevalent, they still rely on well-crafted inputs to learn contextual representations effectively. Particularly with heat demand data, which exhibits strong daily and weekly seasonality along with yearly trends dictated by weather conditions, combining intuitive feature aggregation with these advanced models enhances their ability to capture the residual fluctuations that characterize time series data. This synergy between traditional and modern approaches is crucial for developing industrial applications aimed at reducing carbon emissions. Given the widespread use of statistical modeling for its interpretability and the complex representa- tions learned by DL models, we propose a DL-based forecasting approach that combines that employs an attention mechanism and incorporates individual components of decomposed time series as input features, allowing the model to capture the nuanced factors that influence heat consumption. By elucidating these individual components, we identify the key drivers of next-day heat demand. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is thoroughly evaluated using real-world heat demand data over an entire year, providing insights into its performance across different phases of the annual trend. 2 Methodology For the downstream task of forecasting heat demand, we adopt and adapt a convolution-based network F[9] for which each input feature is represented in a Time-Frequency domain in the form of wavelet scalograms obtained through Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT).
