In this paper, we present a self-attention semantic segmentation method on UA V imageries to assess the damages inﬂicted by a natural dis- aster. The proposed method outperforms four state-of-art segmentation methods both quantita- tively and qualitatively with a mean IoU score of 84:03%. 1. Introduction Recently there have been numerous natural disasters which have brought both personal injuries and economic losses to several countries all over the world. In 2020 alone USA has inﬂicted with 22 natural disasters which have cost around 96.4 billions dollars (noa). Current tropical storms are per- sisting far longer and doing more damage than in the past. In 2017, USA’ fourth largest city Houston, Texas, was in- undated when Hurricane Harvey settled over the city for several days, and was dumped with 127 billion tonnes of water (Van Oldenborgh et al., 2017). Moisture from warm and tropical oceans acts as the fuel of the hurricanes that drives the intense winds. Due to climate change, the air over 1Computer Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory (Bina Lab), University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA.

Consequently, when these storms reach land, the hurricanes should decay very quickly due to lack of fuel from the seas. However, the timescale of decay of the North Atlantic land-falling hurricanes has almost doubled over the past 50 years due to climate change (Li & Chakraborty, 2020). According to (Li & Chakraborty, 2020), the slower decay is fuelled by an increased amount of moisture that is stocked in the hurricane from its passage over ocean prior to landfall. In this scenario, during and even after a natural disaster, a proper assessment of the damages is imperative which can facilitate the rescue efforts. Semantic segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision, aims at assigning semantic labels to each pixels of an image. It can assist in rescue efforts by providing quick and accurate damage as- sessment. DCNNs (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks) has gained popularity in semantic segmentation because of its improved performance compared to traditional computer vision techniques (Chen et al., 2017; 2018; Paszke et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2017). Besides non-disaster scenarios, the potential of DCNNs are also being utilized by several researchers (Lopez-Fuentes et al., 2017; Doshi et al., 2018; Rahnemoonfar et al., 2018; Rudner et al., 2019; Gupta & Shah, 2020; Gupta et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020) in natu- ral disaster damage assessment. Different DCNN seman- tic segmentation methods have been proposed including encoder-decoder and pyramid based methods (Ronneberger et al., 2015; Zhao et al., 2017; Paszke et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2018). Besides these methods, self-attention based methods are showing excellent performance. Self-attention mechanism captures the spatial dependencies between any two positions of the feature maps and thus contribute to the mutual improvement (Fu et al., 2019). In this work, we implement a self-attention based seman- tic segmentation method named ReDNetPlus on a natural disaster dataset FloodNet (Rahnemoonfar et al., 2021). Our results show that our method performs considerably better than four other segmentation methods including both atten- tion and non-attention based methods. This suggests that our approach is feasible and promising.Attention For Damage Assessment Figure 1. Illustration of after disaster scenes of FloodNet dataset.

Self Attention Method State-of-art semantic segmentation methods can be classi- ﬁed into encoder-decoder based method (Ronneberger et al., 2015), pyramid pooling based method (Zhao et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018), and attention based method (Huang et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2019). Encoder-decoder based methods like U-Net adopt local context from middle and lower level fea- tures through encoder-decoder architecture. These methods generate sharp object boundaries or small details based on local context and make high resolution prediction.

In 2020, the United States experienced 22 natural disasters, resulting in approximately $96.4 billion in damages. Current tropical storms are persisting longer and causing more damage than in the past. For example, in 2017, Hurricane Harvey inundated Houston, Texas, with 127 billion tons of water. Moisture from warm and tropical oceans fuels hurricanes, driving intense winds. Due to climate change, the air over oceans can hold more moisture, intensifying storms at sea. Consequently, when these storms reach land, they should decay quickly due to the lack of fuel from the seas. However, the timescale of decay of North Atlantic land-falling hurricanes has almost doubled over the past 50 years due to climate change. This slower decay is fueled by an increased amount of moisture stored in the hurricane from its passage over the ocean prior to landfall.\n\nProper damage assessment during and after a natural disaster is crucial for facilitating rescue efforts. Semantic segmentation, a fundamental task in computer vision, involves assigning semantic labels to each pixel of an image. It can aid in rescue efforts by providing quick and accurate damage assessments. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) have gained popularity in semantic segmentation due to their improved performance compared to traditional computer vision techniques.\n\nBesides non-disaster scenarios, DCNNs are being utilized by researchers in natural disaster damage assessment. Various DCNN semantic segmentation methods have been proposed, including encoder-decoder and pyramid-based methods. Self-attention based methods have also shown excellent performance, capturing spatial dependencies between feature maps and contributing to mutual improvement.\n\nIn this work, we implement a self-attention based semantic segmentation method named ReDNetPlus on the natural disaster dataset FloodNet. Our results demonstrate that our method outperforms four other segmentation methods, including both attention and non-attention based methods. This suggests that our approach is feasible and promising.\n\nAttention for Damage Assessment\n\nFigure 1 illustrates the after-disaster scenes of the FloodNet dataset, showing the original image and corresponding annotations.\n\nRelated Works\n\nSemantic segmentation methods can be classified into three categories: encoder-decoder based methods, pyramid pooling based methods, and attention based methods. Encoder-decoder based methods, such as U-Net, adopt local context from middle and lower level features through an encoder-decoder architecture. These methods generate sharp object boundaries or small details based on local context and make high-resolution predictions. On the other hand, pyramid-based modules create a hierarchical representation of the image, allowing for more accurate predictions."
