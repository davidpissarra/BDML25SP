Unfortunately, devices that can measure air quality can be expensive, and many cities in low and middle-income countries have to rely on a sparse allocation of them. In this paper, we investigate the use of Gaussian Processes for both nowcasting the current air-pollution in places where there are no sensors and forecasting the air-pollution in the future at the sensor locations. In particular, we focus on the city of Kampala in Uganda, using data from AirQo’s network of sensors. We demonstrate the advantage of removing outliers, compare different kernel functions and additional inputs. We also compare two sparse approximations to allow for the large amounts of temporal data in the dataset. 1 Introduction The World Health Organisation recognises air quality as the single biggest environmental threat to human health, estimated to cause 7 million deaths annually [ 1], with the negative affects of air pollution predicted to get more severe with climate change [ 2–4]. Notably, particulate matter with a diameter of less than or equal to 2.5 µm, known as PM 2.5, has been associated with increased all-cause, cardiovascular, respiratory and lung cancer mortality [ 5,6].PM 2.5has also been found to have short-term global heating effects [7–9]. In light of its dangerous impact, monitoring PM 2.5levels in cities is incredibly important, but air pollution sensors are often prohibitively expensive. AirQo [ https://www.airqo.net/about ] are a research group based in Uganda, aiming to empower communities across Africa with information about air quality, in order to increase awareness and encourage citizens to take action against pollution. To address the current lack of air quality information in sub-Saharan Africa, AirQo has developed and deployed a sparse network of low-cost air quality monitors in multiple cities [10]. ∗equal contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.We aim to accurately predict PM 2.5levels in Kampala, using data from AirQo’s network of air quality sensors. Due to the sparse placement of the sensors, we require the predictive model to be data efficient and give a measure of uncertainty, which is useful for decision making. Gaussian processes (GPs) fulfil both these criteria, so we investigate their use for air pollution prediction, comparing the performance of a range of kernels, input factors and sparse approximations to find the best GP model for both nowcasting and forecasting. Data and code is available through the link in Appendix B. 2 Background and Related Work 2.1 Gaussian Processes A Gaussian Process [ 11] is a stochastic process such that for any number of ninputs, x1,..., x n∈ X the function (f(x1),..., f (xn))follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The distribution is defined by a mean function, µ0:X → Rand a positive definite covariance function or kernel κ0:X × X → R. When trying to model an unknown function, f, it is common to assume we have data of the form y=f(x) +σϵwhere σ >0, and ϵis noise modelled using a standard Gaussian distribution. GP regression assumes the noise model, and puts a GP prior on the unknown function f. The posterior of fgiven a dataset D={(xi, yi)}N i=1is also a GP whose mean and covariance can be calculated analytically. See Appendix C for further details. 2.2 Kernel functions The kernel function specifies the covariance of the Gaussian distribution, and therefore it defines the class of functions that it can learn. We focus on the squared exponential and periodic kernels: κSE(x, x′) = exp\u0012||x−x′||2 2ℓ2\u0013 ;κPeriod (xi, xj) = exp −1 2dX k=1  sin(π p(xk i−xk j)) p!2 (1) where ℓrepresents the length-scale parameter, which determines how smooth the function is, and pis the period parameter. The squared exponential assigns similarity to inputs that are close together, while the periodic assigns similarity between inputs that are in similar parts of the period. We can build a kernel from the product or sum of kernel functions, allowing for flexible combinations of different kernels when looking to combine different properties. For example, using a squared exponential kernel spatially and using a periodic kernel temporally. 2.3 Scalability of Gaussian Processes Computing a GP posterior requires inverting a matrix, which typically incurs cubic cost in the number of training data points, i.e\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Air pollution is predicted to worsen with climate change. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less (PM2.5) has been linked to increased mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. PM2.5 has also been found to have short-term global heating effects. Monitoring PM2.5 levels in cities is essential, but air pollution sensors are often too expensive. AirQo, a research group based in Uganda, aims to empower communities across Africa with information about air quality to increase awareness and encourage citizens to take action against pollution. To address the lack of air quality information in sub-Saharan Africa, AirQo has deployed a sparse network of low-cost air quality monitors in multiple cities.\n\nWe aim to accurately predict PM2.5 levels in Kampala using data from AirQo's network of air quality sensors. Due to the sparse placement of sensors, we require a predictive model that is data-efficient and provides a measure of uncertainty, which is useful for decision-making.
