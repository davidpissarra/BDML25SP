As an example, the goal of land use and land cover mapping is to measure the health of populations, urban areas, and ecosystems over time. Since urban areas are responsible for approximately 70% of the world’s energy-related CO 2emissions, tracking the development of cities plays a crucial role in climate change mitigation and adaptation (Lucon and V orsatz, 2014). Interest in the topic has given rise to the collection of different forms of satellite data as a means to map out geospatial regions of the earth. One common form are hyperspectral electro-optical (EO) images, for which there exists an abundance of large labeled datasets. However, EO images cannot capture many factors of our earth’s development; EO sensors are blocked by clouds, limited by the day-and-night cycle, and subject to distortion under various weather conditions. In situations that require imaging over extended time periods, researchers have started working with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data. SAR data is collected by a satellite sending out radar energy and recording the amount reflected back from the earth, making it insusceptible to many of the downsides of EO imaging. Unlike EO datasets, which can be easily interpreted and labeled through crowdsourcing, SAR data requires trained expertise for interpretation. As a result, labeled SAR datasets are both limited in quantity and costly to generate. One approach to extract information from geospatial data with few available labels is transfer ma- chine learning. The idea is to pre-train a neural network on a source domain with plentiful data (i.e., EO) and then fine-tune on a target domain for which little data is available (SAR). In this paper, we focus on a recent method by Rostami et al. (2019a,b), which uses sliced Wasserstein distance to align the distributions of the two modalities in a shared embedding space, and promote knowledge transfer between the classification of EO and SAR images. In doing so, one is not only able to use Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.the few labeled SAR data, but also make use of any available unlabeled data. The original work is limited in that it only does analysis on binary classification using a relatively simple dataset—ships on uncluttered backgrounds. More realistic settings typically involve multiple classes and cluttered scenes, presenting a substantially harder challenge. Further, the original papers do not explore what properties of the embedding space might lead to better alignment, required for these real-world tasks. To gain insight for how to apply EO-to-SAR transfer in practice, this paper studies these issues of multi-class classification and properties of the embedding space. We performed the analysis using Sentinel-1 (EO) and Sentinel-2 (SAR) satellite data, and provide evidence that: • SWD embedding alignment for EO-to-SAR transfer can be scaled to the multi-class setting, • Applying instance normalization leads to more stable training and better performance, and • Applying constrastive learning improves transfer performance of the SWD approach. 2 Data & Methods So2Sat Dataset Focusing on local climate zone classification, our analysis uses the So2Sat LCZ42 dataset (Zhu et al., 2020), which consists of LCZ labels for approximately half a million Sentinel- 1 (EO) and Sentinel-2 (SAR) satellite image patches over 42 cities across the world. Each patch has a resolution of 32×32pixels, and is labeled with one of 17 total classes (ten urban zone types, seven natural zone types). Each zone type is identified by a unique combination of surface structure, cover, and human activity at the local scale ( 102to104m). Originally designed for urban heat island research, LCZ classification also provides significant information, such as the pervious surface fraction and surface albedo values of each zone, in applications to green infrastructure, population assessment, and ecosystem processes (Stewart and Oke, 2020).
