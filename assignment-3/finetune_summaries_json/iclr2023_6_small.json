Precipitation and particularly its extremes have large socio-economic impact (Kotz et al., 2022). While precipitation and the frequency of extreme events are expected to increase with the water-holding capacity of the warming atmosphere globally, local trends show heterogeneous changes (Ali et al., 2018; Traxl et al., 2021). Impact models are built to assess the hydrological, ecological, or socioeconomic impacts and are typically developed and tuned using observation-based data as input. For future projections, impact models rely on simulations from comprehensive Earth system model (ESM) simulations that integrate the governing physical equations on discretized grid. The numerical discretization, at comparable coarse grid size of typically 50 −200km is needed to keep computational costs of global long-term simulations within reasonable bounds. In turn, ESMs require approximations of processes on the smaller, unresolved spatial scales in the form of parameterizations (Balaji et al., 2022). These approximations can lead to systematic errors in the model precipitation, which results from complex interactions of processes across many scales. The bias often manifests as 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 overly blurred images that do not resolve the characteristic high-frequency variability of precipitation both in space and in time, and as an under- or overestimation of extremes. Statistical post-processing methods, such as quantile mapping (Cannon et al., 2015; Lange, 2019), can adjust biases in the frequency distribution for each model grid cell individually. Spatial patterns and correlations between grid cells are, however, not taken into account. Neural networks, on the other hand, can use spatial context and have been successfully applied to weather prediction and post-processing tasks (Gr¨ onquist et al., 2020; Rasp and Thuerey, 2021; Ravuri et al., 2021; Pathak et al., 2022). Applying them to climate simula- tions, however, poses different challenges. Model simulations and observations diverge rapidly due to the chaotic nature of the atmo- sphere, which limits weather forecast horizons. Nevertheless, in the context of numerical weather prediction, forecasts can be directly compared to corresponding ground truth. In the context of climate projections, however, simulated spatial fields of ESMs are unpaired with observations. There is no observational ground truth for a given snapshot of an ESM simulation, and one has to focus on statistical characteristics instead. This is one of the fundamental differences between weather prediction and climate modelling. Given these unpaired samples, cycle-consistent generative adversarial networks (Zhu et al., 2017; Hess et al., 2022) have emerged as powerful tools that can translate the “style” (e.g. the small-scale variability) of precipitation fields from observations to the ESM output. The ESM output is thereby made more realistic while the large-scale patterns (or “content”) are preserved (see Fig. A1 for examples). Our work extends previous studies in two key regards: (i) we apply the GAN-processing to global high-resolution simulations from an ESM in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) that is used to inform policymakers (IPCC, 2021), (ii) we compare the performance against a state-of-the-art bias correction framework ISIMIP3BASD (Lange, 2019) based on quantile mapping (QM), which can be considered the operational state-of- the-art and thus represents a strong baseline. 2 Methodology 2.1 Training data We\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
