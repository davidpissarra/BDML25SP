Introduction News outlets have played a crucial role in increasing aware- ness about climate change through their news articles, be- cause of which more and more people have started to un- derstand the consequences of climate change. The volume of news articles published regarding climate change has been increasing rapidly with the growth in news coverage. This has made it challenging to extract valuable information regarding climate change from these news articles. Algo- rithms that can extract and organize climate change informa- tion by condensing the relevant knowledge directly from a large collection of noisy and redundant news articles could prove to be highly valuable in analyzing relationships be- tween different factors responsible for climate change.

Such knowledge can be distilled from the structured representation of knowledge graphs (KGs) generated from these news articles. There has been a growing interest in generating high-quality KGs for information extraction from raw text (Yu et al., 2020; Saxena et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Nathani et al., 2019; Lin et al., 2019; Wities et al., 2017). Previously, KG construction approaches were either supervised (Bol- lacker et al., 2008) or semi-supervised (Carlson et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2014), both of which were expensive and time- consuming due to the involvement of human supervision. Recently, neural models have enabled KG construction with- out any human involvement (Bosselut et al., 2019; Balaze- vic et al., 2019; Xiong et al., 2018; Trivedi et al., 2017; Garc ´ıa-Dur ´an et al., 2018). The problem with the exist- ing approaches is that they all use some prior knowledge in the form of Knowledge Bases (KB) to learn to predict relationships between the subject-object entity phrases for constructing KGs. This is the major reason why not much work has been done for constructing climate change KGs since there doesn’t exist any well-established KBs for cli- mate change. To solve this problem, we propose Neural NERE, an end- to-end Neural Named Entity Relationship Extraction model for constructing climate change knowledge graphs directly from the raw text of relevant news articles. Additionally, we introduce a new climate change news dataset (called SciDCC dataset1) containing over 11 knews articles scraped from the Science Daily website, which can be used for extracting prior knowledge for constructing climate change knowledge graphs using Neural NERE. 2.SciDCC Dataset The Science Daily Climate Change dataset called SciDCC was created by web scraping news articles from the ”Earth & Climate” and ”Plant & Animals” topics in the environmental science section of the Science Daily (SD) website.

We introduce the Science Daily Climate Change dataset (SciDCC), which contains over 11,000 climate change news articles scraped from the Science Daily website. This dataset can be used to extract prior knowledge for constructing climate change knowledge graphs.\n\nNews outlets have played a crucial role in raising awareness about climate change through their articles, leading to a growing understanding of its consequences. The increasing volume of news articles on climate change has made it challenging to extract valuable information from them.
