Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian non-parametric model that can provide predictions along with the uncertainty in the predicted value, which can be very useful in applications with a high degree of uncertainty. The model is evaluated for short-term forecasts of 48 hours against three main factors—training period, sky area coverage and kernel model selection—and for very short- term forecasts of four hours against sky area. We also compare very short-term forecasts in terms of cloud coverage within the prediction period and only initial cloud coverage as a predictor. I. I NTRODUCTION Fossil fuels are the primary source of energy worldwide, accounting for 84% of primary energy use [1]. However, the world seeks alternatives, and renewable energy has gained interest: its consumption share has grown strongly to over 40% (excluding hydroelectricity) of the global growth in primary energy in 2019 compared to 2018, with solar and wind power being the greatest beneﬁciaries [1]. The chief concern that accompanies solar energy is its uncertainty, which is mainly affected by weather conditions [2]. Being able to predict power generation mere hours ahead would help control the amount that must be generated from fossil fuels, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced. There are two main forecasting methods: model-based approaches and data- driven approaches. An example of model-based approaches is numerical weather prediction (NWP) which employs a set of equations to describe the ﬂow of ﬂuids. Model-based ap- proaches can be complicated and computationally costly. Data- driven approaches, on the other hand, do not use any physical model. They are easier to implement and require no prior knowledge about weather forecasts. Forecasting techniques can be deterministic or probabilistic [2] [3]. Probabilistic approaches can predict a range of values with probabilities, and thus are more appropriate for forecasting applications. In this work we evaluate the accuracy of short-term predic- tions of the amount of energy generated from photovoltaic (PV) systems using Gaussian process regression (GPR), trained using historical data of power output from PV systems together with cloud coverage obtained from high-resolution visible (HRV) satellite images.Integrating PV systems into the grid cannot be efﬁcient unless there is reliable information about power forecast [7]. This is because, whilst it is possible to handle small energy drops by generating slightly energy more than demand, sig- niﬁcant power drops must be replaced within seconds. Fossil fuel plants can take hours to spin from start, and storage battery devices are costly and inefﬁcient for large quantities of photovoltaic panels [8], [9]. Short-term energy prediction can help to determine how much spinning reserve to schedule [8]. Spinning reserve is the unused power capacity which can be activated on the authority of the system operator to serve addi- tional demand [10]. Numerical weather prediction models are useful for predicting elements such as temperature and wind speed, especially in the short term. However, predicting solar irradiance can be inaccurate and very short-term predictions might be inapplicable, for several reasons [8], [11]: \u000fNumerical weather prediction models require at least an hour to execute. This is a problem, especially for cloud forecasting, as it can change rapidly. \u000fThere is no high demand for solar irradiance. \u000fSolar irradiance is computationally expensive to calculate. The gap between the necessity and difﬁculty of predictions which use conventional forecasts opens the door for machine learning. Different solar forecasting models have been devel- oped throughout the years, some of which have achieved great success in solar forecasting. Artiﬁcial neural networks [12], [13] and support vector machines [3], [14] are examples of popular models. Artiﬁcial Neural networks are known for their ability to model complex and non-linear relationships. For time-series applications Gaussian processes (GPs) appear to be recommended for their ability to handle complex relationships [10]. Our appendix explains GPs in more detail; we next discuss research conducted on GPs for PV modelling. Weighted Gaussian Process Regression (WGPR) [2] assigns weights to each data sample, such that high outliers will have lower weights. The forecasting process involves multiple levels, and the model considers eight attributes: solar radiation, photosynthetic active radiation, ambient temperature, wind speed, gust speed, precipitation, wind direction, and humidity. The model has a training data period of approximately 33 days and a validation period of ﬁve consecutive days at ﬁve-minute intervals. Solar radiation and photosynthetic active radiation (PAR) were the most important of the predictors considered. Gaussian process quantile regression (GPQR) model isdiscussed in [10], [14]. Quantile regression aims to estimate the quantiles of the conditional distribution of predicted values given predictor values, which makes the model more robust against outlier predictions. In addition, it captures the rela- tionship between input and output variables.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
