Here we introduce a novel diffusion-based uncertainty quantification (DBUQ) method for efficient model calibration. DBUQ is a score-based diffusion model that leverages Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the score function and evaluates a simple neural network to quickly generate samples for approximating parameter posterior distributions. DBUQ is stable, efficient, and can effectively calibrate the model given diverse observations, thereby enabling rapid and site- specific model calibration on a global scale. This capability significantly advances Earth system modeling and our understanding of climate impacts on Earth systems. We demonstrate DBUQ’s capability in E3SM land model calibration at the Missouri Ozark AmeriFlux forest site. Both synthetic and real-data applications indicate that DBUQ produces accurate parameter posterior distributions similar to those generated by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling but with 30X less computing time. This efficiency marks a significant stride in model calibration, paving the way for more effective and timely climate impact analyses. 1 I NTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Land surface models, such as the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) [ 1;2], Land Model (ELM), serve as an essential tool in enhancing our understanding of how ecosystems respond to climate change and this understanding is crucial for developing strategies to mitigate and adapt to the ongoing and future effects of the change. ELM simulates key processes such as water dynamics, energy exchanges, and biogeochemical cycles occurring on terrestrial surfaces. It involves a large number of parameters [ 3], many of which are not measured and default values are usually used either from surveys of broadly defined plant functional types or by benchmarking the model simulations against global data sets. However, due to differences in climate, soil, and vegetation types between geographic regions, assigning uniform values to these site-specific parameters resulted in inaccurate model simulations at individual sites. Additionally, the deterministic parameter values at a single site do not consider the parameter uncertainty where different parameter sets can produce similar model simulations. Therefore, an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) method is required to enable the site-by-site parameter estimation, thus improving model’s predictability and advancing our understanding of climate impacts on ecosystems globally. 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is a widely adopted method for estimating parameter uncertainty [ 4;5;6]. It involves generating a series of samples from the posterior probability density function (PDF) to quantify uncertainty. Ideally, with sufficient iterations, these samples converge to the true PDF. However, MCMC is notoriously computationally intensive, often necessitating hundreds of thousands of model evaluations, which are not fully parallelizable. Rapidly quantifying uncertainty in land surface modeling is crucial, as it underpins informed decision-making, adaptive management, and effective risk management and resource allocation in the face of pressing climate change. To mitigate these computational demands, machine learning (ML)-based UQ methods have been introduced. Some researchers employ ML to create fast surrogate models, accelerating model evaluations during MCMC sampling [ 7;8;9;10]. Others leverage generative modeling techniques like normalizing flows for direct UQ problem-solving [ 11;12;13;14;15;16]. Surrogate modeling demands a globally accurate surrogate across the entire parameter space and requires a new MCMC simulation whenever site- specific likelihood functions vary. Whereas, normalizing flows hinge on an invertible neural network structure, which requires costly computation of inverse mappings and Jacobian determinants. These limitations hinder their effective applications for ELM parameter estimation, underscoring the need for more efficient approaches. In this study, we introduce a novel diffusion-based uncertainty quantification method (DBUQ) for efficient parameter estimation. Diffusion models are a class of generative ML models used to generate samples from a given data distribution [ 17;18;15]. The process begins by sampling from a prescribed noise distribution—typically an i.i.d. Gaussian distribution—and then iteratively transforming that sample via a learned denoiser, until it approximates a sample from the target distribution (here the posterior PDF of ELM parameters). The differences in the denoising process result in various diffusion models, with the score-based diffusion model standing out for its solid theoretical foundation and its capability to produce high-quality samples. This method uses a neural network (NN) to learn the score function and then repeatedly solves a reverse stochastic differential equation (SDE) using the learned score function to draw target samples. However, this method is computationally intensive due to the iterative reverse process required to generate each sample and the necessity of precise score estimation at every iteration. Additionally, diffusion models are typically trained in an unsupervised manner due to\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
