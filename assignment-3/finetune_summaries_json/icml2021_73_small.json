Introduction The Canadian Arctic Archipelago is one of the most vulnerable places in the world to climate change. Its ecosystems, closely tied to the extreme conditions of the North, are particularly fragile and their integrity is threatened by a warming rate faster than lower-latitude parts of the globe (Bush & Lemmen, 2019). Because Arctic food webs are composed of a few highly interconnected species, negative impacts affecting one component of the system are likely to have cascading effects on all of the others. Understanding how disruptions of speciﬁc trophic interactions scale up to the entire system is key to anticipate the consequences of global environmental changes, but large scale modeling of ecological interactions is challenging and the ecosystem monitoring required to parametrize them are rare (Godsoe et al., 2017). 1Universit ´e Laval2Institut intelligence et donn ´ees (IID)3Mila 4Centre d’ ´Etudes Nordiques (CEN)5CNRS — Centre d’ ´Etudes Biologiques de Chiz ´e (CEBC)6Centre de la science de la biodi- versit ´e du Qu ´ebec (CSBQ)7Universit ´e du Qu ´ebec `a Rimouski (UQAR)8Canada CIFAR AI Chair.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICML 2021One of the ﬂagship species for the study of climate change in the Arctic is the Arctic fox ( Vulpes lagopus ) (Ehrich et al., 2015). It is its only endemic terrestrial predator (Fugley & Ims, 2008) and its populations are currently monitored at 34 sites throughout the circumpolar North (Berteaux et al., 2017). In Canada, they are notably studied through a research station on Bylot Island, an 11 100 km2island located at the northern tip of Bafﬁn Island, Nunavut (Figure 1a). Indeed, the movements of Bylot foxes are actively monitored with GPS tracking collars since 2007 (see Figure 1b). (a)  (b) Figure 1. (a) Location of Bylot Island (box) on a map of Canada. (b) GPS location every 4 minutes of four foxes over a three month period in 2018 and 2019 on a map of Bylot. The study of predators is particularly important in the Canadian Arctic, as they are the dominant force controlling its food web (Krebs et al., 2003; Gauthier et al., 2011). A change in predator-prey interactions can signiﬁcantly disrupt the ecosystem dynamics, and understanding how predation affects the distribution of Arctic biodiversity is critical to preserve its integrity in the face of environmental changes. Such an understanding can only be achieved with the help of mathematical models able to transform ﬁeld data into powerful explanatory and predictive tools. Bylot’s Arctic foxes tracking data, coupled with satellite maps and prey abundance information, can be used to model their movements at the individual level. Realistic modeling of animal movement is a crucial ﬁrst step to understand the processes regulating species distribution and abundance.

Current methods in ecology are however insufﬁcient to capture complex movement decisions and their sequential nature adequately. On the other hand, reinforcement learning (RL) (Sutton & Barto, 2018) methods, where an agent tries to optimize its decisions through trial and error, could be well suited to solve such tasks.
