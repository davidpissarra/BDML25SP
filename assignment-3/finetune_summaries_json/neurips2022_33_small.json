Archibald Yusuf Hamied Department of Chemistry University of Cambridge Cambridge, UK, CB2 1EW ata27@cam.ac.uk Abstract Surface ozone is an air pollutant that contributes to hundreds of thousands of pre- mature deaths annually. Accurate short-term ozone forecasts may allow improved policy to reduce the risk to health, such as air quality warnings. However, fore- casting ozone is a difficult problem, as surface ozone concentrations are controlled by a number of physical and chemical processes which act on varying timescales. Accounting for these temporal dependencies appropriately is likely to provide more accurate ozone forecasts. We therefore deploy a state-of-the-art transformer-based model, the Temporal Fusion Transformer, trained on observational station data from three European countries. In four-day test forecasts of daily maximum 8-hour ozone, the novel approach is highly skilful (MAE = 4.6 ppb, R2= 0.82), and generalises well to two European countries unseen during training (MAE = 4.9 ppb, R2= 0.79). The model outperforms standard machine learning models on our data, and compares favourably to the published performance of other deep learning architectures tested on different data. We illustrate that the model pays attention to physical variables known to control ozone concentrations, and that the attention mechanism allows the model to use relevant days of past ozone concentrations to make accurate forecasts. 1 Introduction Surface ozone is a secondary pollutant which is not directly emitted by anthropogenic activities, but formed in the troposphere via a series of photochemical reactions [ 1]. Surface ozone is estimated to contribute to between 365,000 and 1.1 million premature deaths worldwide annually [ 2,3,4,5], primarily by causing cardiovascular and respiratory diseases [ 6,7,8]. The impacts of ozone pollution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.have been linked to both long and short-term exposure to high ozone [ 9,10]. Background levels of ozone in remote areas often exceed guidelines, while local ozone concentrations can far exceed guidelines. The WHO estimates that 99% of the worldâ€™s population live in areas where concentrations routinely exceed guidelines [ 11]. Due to its phytotoxicity, the negative effects of ozone air pollution on vegetation, ecosystems and crops are also significant [ 12,13], leading to considerable economic losses from reduced crop yields [ 14]. Forecasting ozone concentrations is important to quantify and reduce the risks of ozone pollution to human and ecosystem health [ 15], particularly as climate change is expected to lead to increased ozone in some regions [16, 17]. Derived from the key processes controlling ozone, in-situ photochemical production and transport, there are multiple relationships between ozone and climate-sensitive environmental covariates such as temperature and meteorology that act on varying timescales [ 18,19]. The contribution of each of these factors makes accurate forecasting of ozone with numerical forward (e.g. weather forecast) transport models (CTMs) and standard machine learning (ML) methods a complex and computationally expensive task. The timescale of influence of these environmental variables may be on the order of days or weeks. Varying anthropogenic emissions also affect ozone (e.g. weekdays vs. weekends), and therefore an ML approach that accounts for these temporal relationships is necessary. Transformers have been shown to be highly effective in sequential domains such as natural language processing [20,21], in part due to their ability to attend to long-term dependencies in the data, and therefore a transformer-based model may provide an intrinsic advantage over standard ML models (such as random forests) and convolutional and recurrent neural networks that have been previously explored in the ozone forecasting literature [22, 23, 24]. In this work we train and evaluate a transformer-based ML model, focussing on the skill of the model when forecasting extreme ozone and ozone in countries unseen during training. This is a step towards ML models capable of making accurate short-term forecasts of surface ozone now, and in future climates. 2 Methodology 2.1 Model To complement existing ML methods and numerical CTMs for ozone forecasting, we deploy a state- of-the-art temporal deep learning architecture, the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [ 25]. The TFT combines gated residual networks, variable selection networks, an Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder layer, and multi-head attention. The TFT ingests both static and dynamic predictive features, and in order to extract prediction intervals a quantile loss function was used. Despite being a relatively computationally expensive ML method, training the TFT on our dataset took 2 hours using 2 Tesla V100 GPUs. Once trained, forecasts across 994 individual stations are made in seconds. This illustrates the vast speed-up of ML models compared to CTMs (which typically take hours or days to run).
