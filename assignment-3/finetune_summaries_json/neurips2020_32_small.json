Emissions studies utilize counts of equipment to estimate emissions from production facilities. However these counts are poorly documented, including both information about well pad locations and major equipment on each well pad. While these data can be found by manually reviewing satellite imagery, it is prohibitively difﬁcult and time consuming. This work, part of a larger study of methane emission studies in Colorado, US, adapted a machine learning (ML) algorithm to detect well pads and associated equipment. Our initial model showed an average well pad detection accuracy of 95% on the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin in northeastern Colorado. Our example demonstrates the potential for this type of automated detection from satellite imagery, leading to more accurate and complete models of production emissions. 1 Introduction Methane, the main component of natural gas, is a powerful greenhouse gas with a global warming potential over 80 times that of CO2 on a 20-year basis[14]. Reducing methane emissions has been identiﬁed as a key requirement to limit global warming[15,16,17,18,19]. Active natural gas production sites account for 67% of the total methane emission from oil and gas industry[20]. A study was conducted by nine cooperating U.S natural gas companies to study the methane emissions from well pads and production sites. The study showed that methane leaks from equipment and during transportation are much higher than previously thought[21]. The work described here is part of a top-down, bottom-up, coordinated campaign to be conducted in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin in northeastern Colorado in 2021. Methods planned for this study mirror those utilized in the Fayetteville coordinated study [22,23,24,25,26] and the Barnett coordinated campaign[27]. Methods utilized for these studies involve the development of ‘bottom-up’ (BU) inventories of emissions. Inventories utilize prior emissions distributions, resolved to the component level to represent emissions from individual leaks. These emissions data are multiplied, using Monte Carlo methods, with activity data consisting of counts of major equipment, components per major equipment unit, and other operational data. These calculations result in an empirical distribution of emissions expected from all oil and gas facilities in a basin. When additional information is Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.available to resolve the timing of emissions, BU estimates may be extended by modeling the timing of emissions events, and, potentially, the downwind dispersion of pollutants. Since BU studies rely on counts of equipment and components, the accuracy of the counts has a substantial impact on the modelled emissions. The location of wells is generally well known, as the location of the bore hole, drilling direction, and production is reported to state authorities. While traditional ﬁeld development integrated wells directly onto well pads containing initial processing equipment, such as separators and tanks, in recent development, wellheads are often at a substantial distance from the well pad containing that equipment. Further, reporting of well pad locations is typically not required, and few location-speciﬁc data sets exist. To ﬁll this data gap for the upcoming campaign, the study team developed a machine learning model to identify well pads in the DJ basin from recent satellite imagery with 70 cm resolution. 2 Dataset We have created a dataset annotating the location of well pads and storage tanks in Colorado using GoogleTMsatellite imagery. To assist in annotation we’ve created a plugin in QGIS, an open source GIS software and used the plugin to annotate over 1650 images of well pads in Colorado and 500 images for storage tanks. There were multiple well pads and well tanks in most of the images and we annotated over 2826 well pads and 1712 well tanks. Three distinct geographic areas are included in the dataset roughly corresponding to north-west, south-west and central regions of the state. The well pads in these three areas have different characteristics. In the north-west the well pads are surrounded by deserted land, in the south-west well pads are mostly surrounded by forest/vegetation and most of the well pads in central Colorado are near buildings and roads. The diversity of well pad examples drawn from the different parts of Colorado provides an excellent basis for generalization for our machine learning models. Storage tanks are much more self-similar and consequently it was not necessary to collect as many training examples. Storage tank examples do vary due to factors such as the size and shape of shadows, time of year, and minor variations typically associated with surrounding context. Overall, we concluded that no more than 500 images of storage tanks needed to be hand labeled in order to train our ML model. One other aspect of applying ML to recognizing storage tanks became apparent as the dataset was being collected. A variety of other objects near and in gas production ﬁelds look similar to well tanks, such as grain and agricultural water storage tanks. Therefore, we also collected over 50 negative samples of storage tank-like structures to better train the ML model to avoid\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
