We deﬁne a set of 18 actions and collect a dataset of 2183 comparisons from 176 users on a university campus. The early results reveal promising directions to improve climate communication and enhance climate mitigation. 1 Introduction To put the focus on actions that have high potential for emission reduction, we must ﬁrst understand whether people have an accurate perception of the carbon footprint of these actions. If they do not, their efforts might be wasted. As an example, recent work by Wynes and Nicholas [6]shows that Canadian high-school textbooks encourage daily actions that yield negligible emission reduction. Actions with a higher potential of emission reduction are poorly documented. In this work, we model how people perceive the carbon footprint of their actions, which could guide educators and policy-makers. In their daily life, consumers repeatedly face multiple options with varying environmental effects. Except for a handful of experts, no one is able to estimate the absolute quantity of CO 2emitted by their actions of say, ﬂying from Paris to London. Most people, however, are aware that taking the train for the same trip would release less CO 2. Hence, in the spirit of Thurstone [5]and Salganik and Levy [4](among many others), we posit that the perception of a population can be probed by simple pairwise comparisons. By doing so, we shift the complexity from the probing system to the model: Instead of asking difﬁcult questions about each action and simply averaging the answers, we ask simple questions in the form of comparisons and design a non-trivial model to estimate the perception. In ﬁne, human behaviour boils down to making choices: For example, we choose between eating local food and eating imported food; we do not choose between eating or not eating. Our awareness of relative emissions between actions (of the same purpose) is often sufﬁcient to improve our carbon footprint. Our contributions are as follows. First, we cast the problem of inferring a population’s global perception from pairwise comparisons as a linear regression. Second, we adapt a well-known active- learning method to maximize the information gained from each comparison. We describe the model and the active-learning algorithm in Section 2. We design an interactive platform to collect real data for an experiment on our university campus, and we show early results in Section 3. Our approach could help climate scientists, sociologists, journalists, governments, and individuals improve climate communication and enhance climate mitigation. 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.2 Model LetAbe a set ofMactions.

For instance, \"flying from London to New York\" or \"eating meat for a year\" are both actions in A. Let (i, j, y) be a triplet encoding that action i in A has an impact ratio of y > 0 over action j in A. Said otherwise, if y > 1, action i has a carbon footprint y times greater than action j, and if y < 1, action i has a carbon footprint 1/y times smaller than action j.\n\nGiven some parameters w_i and w_j representing the perceived (log-)carbon footprint in CO2-equivalent of action i and action j, we posit y = exp(w_i) / exp(w_j). We gather the parameters in a vector w in R^M. Assuming a centered Gaussian noise ε ∼ N(0, σ^2_n), σ^2_n in R, we model the (log-)impact ratio log(y) = w_i - w_j + ε = x|w + ε, (1)\n\nwhere the comparison vector x in R^M is zero everywhere except in entry i where it is +1 and in entry j where it is -1. Vector x \"selects\" the pair of actions to compare.\n\nFor a dataset D = {(i_n, j_n, y_n) : n = 1,..., N} of N independent triplets and since log(y) ∼ N(x|w, σ^2_n), the likelihood of the model is p(y|X, w) = ∏[N (y_i|x_iw, σ^2_n)] (3)\n\nwhere y in R^N is the vector of observed (log-)impact ratios, and X in R^N x M is a matrix of N comparison vectors. We assume a Gaussian prior for the weight parameters w ∼ N(μ, Σ_p), where μ in R^M is the prior mean and Σ_p in R^M x M is the prior covariance matrix.\n\nTo obtain the global perceived carbon footprint of each action in A and to enable active learning, we compute the posterior distribution of the weight parameters given the data, p(w|X, y) = p(y|X, w)p(w) / p(y|X) = N(w|Σ^-1_p (Σ_p^-1 μ + X^T X / σ^2_n)^-1"
