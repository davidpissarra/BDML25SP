Model output statistics (MOS) reduce these errors by ﬁtting the model output to observational data with machine learning. In this work, we explore the feasibility and potential of deep learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for MOS. We propose the CNN architecture ConvMOS speciﬁcally de- signed for reducing errors in climate model outputs and apply it to the climate model REMO. Our results show a considerable reduction of errors and mostly improved performance compared to three commonly used MOS approaches. 1 Introduction An important source of information for the prospective effects of climate change are numerical climate models such as general circulation models (GCMs) and regional climate models (RCMs). However, these climate models often exhibit systematic errors and deﬁciencies in representations of climate processes which limit the quality of the resulting projections. This problem is especially pronounced for precipitation. It is therefore common to apply model output statistics (MOS), which are statistical post-processing techniques to reduce these errors. MOS approaches correct the modeled precipitation to correspond more closely to observational data. This allows us to study future climate conditions and the effects of climate change more accurately especially at a local scale [1]. There are two general approaches to MOS – distribution-wise MOS and event-wise MOS. Distribution- wise MOS corrects the distribution of the simulated variable by mapping means and other distribution characteristics to the observational distribution. Event-wise MOS directly links the simulated and observed time series through statistical models, which generally performs better than distribution-wise MOS [2]. We therefore consider event-wise MOS in this work. A number of approaches to event-wise MOS have been used in previous work. A very simple approach is local scaling where an individual Linear Regression is ﬁtted per location of interest, which has shown to work reasonably well [ 2]. Other works propose non-local MOS approaches, where for each location the MOS is aware of the climatic conditions at nearby locations. This can lead to a large number of predictors for the MOS, which is why dimensionality reduction techniques, e. g. principal component analysis (PCA), are often applied [ 1,2,3,4]. Non-local MOS has been done with a range of machine learning models namely Linear Regression [ 1,2], Random Forests (RFs) [3, 4], Support Vector Machines (SVMs) [3, 5, 6], and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) [7]. While these methods have proven to be effective, we believe that there is considerable potential in exploring the use of advanced deep learning techniques. Especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [ 8] have shown proﬁciency in tasks with geospatial data [ 9,10], which indicates potential for Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.novel non-local MOS with this type of neural network. We believe that their ability to learn spatial patterns is well suited for reducing systematic errors in climate models. It is therefore promising to assess how this can be used for MOS and whether there is potential for performance improvements. In this work, we examine the feasibility and potential of convolutional deep learning models as MOS. Thus, we propose the CNN architecture ConvMOS speciﬁcally designed for climate MOS and apply it to correcting simulated precipitation of the RCM REMO [ 11,12,13]. Our results show that ConvMOS can reduce errors considerably, providing mostly better performance than three commonly used MOS approaches. This suggests that our proposed approach is feasible and promising. 2 Dataset Model Data For our study we use daily data of the hydrostatic version of the RCM REMO (version REMO2015) [ 11,12,13] for the period 2000 to 2015. Our study area has been deﬁned over an extended German region with 0:11\u000e\u00020:11\u000eresolution covering the area from \u00001:43\u000eto22:22\u000eE and42:77\u000eto57:06\u000eN (GER-11). We use the following 22MOS predictors from REMO: Daily mean, minimum and maximum temperature 2 mabove surface [ K], u- and v-wind 10 m above surface [ m s\u00001], sea level pressure [ Pa] and total precipitation (convective + large scale + snow- fall) [ mm]. Further, the temperature [ K], geopotential height [ m], and speciﬁc humidity [ kg kg\u00001] in the pressure levels of 100,200,500,850and950 hPa are used. For elevation information the dataset GTOPO ( 0:009\u000e\u00020:009\u000e) [14,15] is used by REMO, which we also employ as another predictor for ConvMOS.
