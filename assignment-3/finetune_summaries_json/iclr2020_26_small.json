Yet there are still factors if in- cluded could help in understanding problem better. This proposal tries to annotate missing features that if applied could help in a better understanding energy con- sumption in smart buildings impact on environment. Second, to have a uniﬁed standards that help different solutions to be compared properly. 1 I NTRODUCTION Buildings energy consumption is accounted for a considerable percentage from total energy con- sumption on electric grid. For example, in US, commercial and residential energy consumption accounted for around 40% of total energy consumption. Meanwhile in UK, Germany residential sector accounted for 28%, 26%, of total energy consumption in each country respectively Iskan- darova & Genus (2019),Grealis et al. (2019). The increase of electronic devices allowed more data to be gathered about power consumption especially within residential buildings. Though different data sources have been gathered, still there are missing points to have a machine learning models work better for optimizing energy consumption. and lacking for agreed standards in optimizing energy consumption problem makes the problem more harder to attack and solution methods will not appear on the same basis. Pecan street Inc. dataset collects data for residential area it includes: type of rooms, number of windows, availability of some devices, etc. and such diversity enabled different contributions in this area. However, it lacked conclusive indicators for weather conditions which play important rule in energy consumption and other environmental impact to electric devices. Social game dataset Konstantakopoulos et al. (2019) addressed the problem form a little different perspective as it recorded unit features with indicative features for weather conditions. Still we can’t have full picture of residential energy consumption behavior as it’s a residential building inside uni- versity campus. In addition to points mentioned, neither of both datasets addressed energy sources (i.e. how much solar power, wind power, etc. contribute to the electric grid). This proposal tries to address gaps (between datasets) that could help in better understanding of energy consumption in smart infrastructure and more uniﬁed standards in comparison. In the following subsections I’ll discuss brieﬂy main previous datasets that are strongly related to proposal. 1.1 P ECAN STREET INC. DATASET A dataset collects different appliances data minute by minute from residential buildings (mainly Austin, TX). Dataset shows how much each component consumes over the time domain. Dataset also records how is the size of house, house construction, number of windows, etc. Dataset also can be combined with records from time of use energy tariffs for energy consumption like used in Mocanu et al. (2018). Where they implemented two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to solve two problems: Reduce load peaks, and minimize cost of energy. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 1.2 S OCIAL GAME DATASET Dataset in Konstantakopoulos et al. (2019) is collected from residential housing of Nanyang Tech- nological University. Dataset is comprised from a record of minute by minute for different possible energy resources including desk light, room light and ceiling fan/air conditioning (a.k.a Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HV AC)) while labeling in data important times for students like break, midterm, or ﬁnal exam. The authors extended the work and built web portal so user can interact with his own info about energy consumption and do actions. While those who can reduce their energy consumption get re- warded. This gamiﬁcation process allowed to record both the electronic devices behavior and the human behavior within a non-cooperative game theory framework. 2 P ROPOSAL Park et al. (2019) in an effort to deﬁne a load shape (e.g. either residential, commercial, etc.) gathered different data sources in their work. I’ll mention in the following points what I think aimed dataset must contain both for optimizing energy consumption and dealing with climate change: \u000fStructure of main energy sources within the smart-grid unit(where unit is: city, neighbor- hood, etc.): how much percentage it’s generated from fossil fuels, solar energy, wind farms, etc. To assess energy consumption harm to environment. As a big consumption sourced mainly from renewable energy isn’t a threat as compared relatively to a small consumption but from fossil fuels. \u000fUniﬁed energy time step: either it’s second, or minute, etc. Surely it’s better to have data by seconds but it may be hard due to different technical issues but investigating migration to minutes will cause feature loss for dataset is necessary (especially for Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) models) \u000fWater consumption as an auxiliary data and relation with appliances like heater, dish- washer, clothes washing machine, etc. \u000fConsidering other environmental impact for electrical devices like consumed water and the effect on clean water resources, Chloroﬂuorocarbon (CFC) emissions from refrigerators, HV AC, etc\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to optimize energy consumption. However, there are still factors that need to be considered to better understand the problem. This proposal aims to identify missing features that can help improve the understanding of energy consumption in smart buildings and its impact on the environment. Additionally, it seeks to establish unified standards to enable the comparison of different solutions.\n\nIntroduction:\n\nBuildings account for a significant percentage of total energy consumption on the electric grid. For example, in the US, commercial and residential energy consumption accounted for around 40% of total energy consumption, while in the UK and Germany, residential sector accounted for 28% and 26% of total energy consumption, respectively (Iskandarova & Genus, 2019; Grealis et al., 2019). The increasing number of electronic devices has enabled the collection of more data on power consumption, particularly in residential buildings. However, there are still missing points to improve the performance of machine learning models for optimizing energy consumption, and the lack of agreed standards in optimizing energy consumption makes the problem more challenging.\n\nThe Pecan Street Inc. dataset collects data from residential areas, including the type of rooms, number of windows, and availability of certain devices. However, it lacks conclusive indicators for weather conditions, which play a crucial role in energy consumption and environmental impact on electric devices. The Social Game dataset (Konstantakopoulos et al., 2019) addresses the problem from a different perspective by recording unit features with indicative features for weather conditions. However, it only provides a partial picture of residential energy consumption behavior, as it is a residential building within a university campus. Neither of these datasets addresses energy sources, such as the contribution of solar power, wind power, etc., to the electric grid.\n\nThis proposal aims to address the gaps between datasets to better understand energy consumption in smart infrastructure and establish more unified standards for comparison.\n\nPrevious Datasets:\n\n1.1 Pecan Street Inc. Dataset:\n\nThe Pecan Street Inc. dataset collects data on different appliances from residential buildings in Austin, TX. The dataset shows how much each component consumes over time and also records the size of the house, house construction, number of windows, etc. The dataset can be combined with records from time-of-use energy tariffs for energy consumption, as implemented in Mocanu et al. (2018), which used two Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods to solve two problems: reducing load peaks and minimizing energy costs.\n\n1.2 Social Game Dataset:\n\nThe Social Game dataset (Konstantakopoulos et al., 2019) is collected from residential housing at Nanyang Technological University. The dataset records minute-by-minute data for different possible energy resources, including desk light, room light, and ceiling fan/air conditioning (HVAC), while labeling important times for students, such as break, midterm, or final exam. The authors extended the work by building a web portal for users to interact with their energy consumption data and take actions. The gamification process allowed for the recording of both electronic device behavior and human behavior within a non-cooperative game theory framework.\n\nProposal:\n\nPark et al. (2019) aimed to define a load shape by gathering different data sources. The following points are proposed for the ideal dataset to optimize energy consumption and address climate change:\n\n* Structure of main energy sources within the smart-grid unit (city, neighborhood, etc.): the percentage of energy generated from fossil fuels, solar energy, wind farms, etc., to assess energy consumption harm to the environment.\n* Unified energy time step (second, minute, etc.): it is better to have data by seconds, but investigating migration to minutes may cause feature loss, especially for Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) models.\n* Water consumption as auxiliary data and its relation with appliances like heaters, dishwashers, clothes washing machines, etc.\n* Considering other environmental impact for electrical devices, such as consumed water and the effect on clean water resources, Chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) emissions from refrigerators, HVAC, etc."
