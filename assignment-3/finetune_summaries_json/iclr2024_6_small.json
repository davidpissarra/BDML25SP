Formally comparing ecological interaction networks is a critical step towards understanding the impact of climate change on ecosystem functioning, yet current methods for ecolog- ical network analysis are unable to do so. We propose using the Gromov- Wasserstein (GW) metric for quantifying dissimilarity between ecological networks. We demonstrate the corresponding optimal transport plans of this distance can be interpreted as species functional alignment between food webs. Our results show that GW transport plans align species from different mammal communities consistent with ecological understanding. Further- more, we illustrate extensions of the GW distance to notions of averages and factorization over ecological networks. Ultimately, we propose the foundation for a novel interpretable topological data analysis framework to inform future ecological research and conservation management. 1 Introduction Figure 1: Location of the 170 mammal food webs across dif- ferent biomes of Sub-Saharan Africa. See Appendix A.1 for details.Predator-prey interactions play a critical role in the mainte- nance of biodiversity by promoting stability (Estes et al., 2011; Landi et al., 2018). However, climate change causes many species to shift their geographic ranges as they track preferred environmental conditions (Parmesan, 2006), thereby altering ecological communities and the interactions between species within them (Williams and Jackson, 2007). Investigating how food web topology varies along environmental gradients can inform our understanding of future food webs (Tylianakis and Morris, 2017), promoting interests in analyzing ecological networks from a data-driven graph machine learning perspec- tive (Poisot et al., 2016; Tuia et al., 2022). Despite widespread community interest in studying ecological networks, existing graph analysis and comparison methods (Tantardini et al., 2019) are either computationally intractable (Ghosh et al., 2018), not interpretable (Liu et al., 2022), dependent on extensive hyperparameter tuning and selection of motifs (e.g., graphlets (Sarajlić et al., 2016), graph kernels (Ghosh et al., 2018), and graph neural networks), or only applicable to same-sized 1networks (Gera et al., 2018). Moreover, it remains an open problem to fully characterize the structural differences among ecological networks (Pellissier et al., 2018). This paper proposes using the Gromov-Wasserstein (GW) distance to quantify dissimilarity between ecological networks. In the context of networks, the GW distance is a pseudomet- ric (Chowdhury and Mémoli, 2019) with competitive empirical performance on tasks such as graph clustering (Chowdhury and Needham, 2021), graph partitioning (Xu et al., 2019), and graph factorization (Xu, 2020). More importantly, unlike current spectral methods based on graph Laplacians (Wilson and Zhu, 2008), GW compares graphs of different sizes, which is critically important for ecological networks because communities support different numbers of species. GW distances have corresponding optimal transport plans describing how the nodes are mapped between graphs. In the ecological context, this optimal transport plan can reveal corresponding functional roles between two species in different food webs. Furthermore, GW distance can be extended into a suite of distance-based machine learning algorithms onto ecological networks. The main contributions of this paper are described as follows: 1. Measure graph characterization: Computing the GW distance requires a probability distribution representation of the graphs. We formalize the viable configurations, discuss their ecological relevance, and contrast their performance. 2. GW for topology representations: We present empirical evidence that the GW distance clusters synthetic graphs of varying sizes into groups corresponding to its topology: paths, cycles, and stars. Furthermore, we show that the GW distance produces geometrically intuitive transport plans and barycenters. 3. GW on food webs: We validate our proposed method by analyzing 170 Sub-Saharan mammal communities. We first illustrate how the optimal transport matrix successfully maps many species to themselves in a pair of food webs with many shared species. We also identify mismatched species based on their functional similarities as understood in ecology. Furthermore, we extend our analyses to Fréchet Mean and Graph Factorization over food webs, showcasing their applicability to ecology. We attached our results in the appendix due to space constraints. 2 Gromov-Wasserstein for Ecological Networks In this section, we formally define configurations of probability distributions on graphs as required by computing the network GW distance.
