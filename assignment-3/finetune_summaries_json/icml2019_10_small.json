However, these methods suffer from high compu- tational complexity and are not scalable to large datasets. In this paper, we aim to apply a novel framework named as targeted meta-learning to rectify this issue, and show its efﬁcacy in dealing with the aforementioned biases in datasets. This framework employs a small, well-crafted target dataset that resembles the desired nature of test data in order to guide the learning process in a coupled manner. We empirically show that this framework can overcome the bias issue, common to weather-related datasets, in a bow echo detec- tion case study. 1. Introduction Drastically improving their performance, machine learning and, more distinctively, deep learning models, are becoming the main propulsion of technology in a variety of domains. Notwithstanding their success, they are still suffering from different biases in the training data distribution. Biases, re- gardless of their nature, cause a mismatch between training and test data distributions, which leads to a poor generaliza- tion of the model on the test distribution. A palpable form of these biases appears when the size of different classes or 1College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Penn- sylvania State University, University Park, USA2Department of Computer Science & Engineering, The Pennsylvania State Uni- versity, University Park, USA.

When class sizes are not balanced, imbalanced dataset problem arises (Buda et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2016; Ting, 2000), where large classes can dominate the training process, resulting in a model having low ac- curacy on small classes. A severe form of the problem, appearing in most real-world big datasets with immense number of classes, is long-tailed data distribution (Cui et al., 2019; Bengio, 2015; Ouyang et al., 2016), where the data distribution is skewed (Kendall et al., 1946). In this case, most of the data belongs to a few prevailing classes, while huge number of classes are represented by a few number of samples. Weather-related datasets, from real-time high temporal- or spatial-resolution satellite or radar image data, for detecting and predicting critical incidents mostly fall in this category. Important critical incidents are rare in such datasets, making detecting and forecasting these unusual events difﬁcult for machine learning models. A generic idea to address these biases is to adapt the train- ing distribution to the test distribution, whether it is by resampling, or assigning weights based on the training loss to have a cost-sensitive weighting scheme (Elkan, 2001; Ting, 2000; Khan et al., 2018) such as boosting methods like AdaBoost (Freund & Schapire, 1997) or curriculum learning (Bengio et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2018). However, relying merely on the training distribution has shown to be not practically efﬁcient (Ren et al., 2018). A new strand of research is to augment single-objective learning models with additional data-driven constraints in or- der to alleviate the effect of bias in training data (Cotter et al., 2018; Ren et al., 2018; Jiang et al., 2018; Andrychowicz et al., 2016). The main idea motivating this paradigm shift is that error rate on training data is not a satisfactory criterion by itself, and should be accompanied with a data-driven regularization. An appealing data-driven regularization idea is to create a target dataset that resembles desired properties of the test distribution, and impose it to the training process as an additional constraint. Meta-learning (Andrychow- icz et al., 2016; Finn et al., 2017) introduces a coupled framework to interlace the hyperparameter tuning using a validation set with the training process in order to guide it. In this paper, we adopt Targeted Meta-Learning framework, which employs a small target distribution and bilevel pro- gramming to model the multi-objective structure on bothTargeted Meta-Learning training and target distributions. As a bilevel programming, targeted meta-learning has two levels, one dealing with the main training process while the other uses a well-tuned tar- get dataset in order to optimize the weights of each desired class or group in the dataset. We will show that this frame- work can overcome the biases in weather-related learning problems by applying it to detect bow echoes in radar data. 2.
