We argue that many such climate datasets are uniquely biased due to the pervasive use of external simulation models (e.g., general cir- culation models) and proxy variables (e.g., satellite measure- ments) for imputing and extrapolating in-situ observational data. We discuss opportunities for mitigating the bias in the training and deployment of ML systems using such datasets. Finally, we share views on improving the reliability and ac- countability of ML systems for climate science applications. 1 Introduction Large datasets are fueling major advances in the scal- ing of machine learning (ML) systems for a variety of real- world usecases of relevance to science and society, ranging from creative art and text generation (Ramesh et al. 2021; Brown et al. 2020) to protein folding (Jumper et al. 2021) and drug discovery (Vamathevan et al. 2019). This has led to a growing optimism for the broad field of climate change as well (Rolnick et al. 2022). With advancements in sensory, storage, and network technology, we now have large datasets available for many domains of interest to climate change, such as weather forecasting (Rasp et al. 2020), agriculture and forestry (Zheng et al. 2019), and chemical and materi- als discovery (Kirklin et al. 2015; Chanussot et al. 2021), among others. As the first step of any ML pipeline, the choice of a train- ing dataset is critical to the downstream performance of ML systems. Both the quantity and quality of a dataset play an important role, as demonstrated by numerous prior studies (e.g., (Gebru et al. 2021)) that correlate the size, noise, and bias within training datasets with broad and holistic indica- tors of downstream performance, such as accuracy and fair- Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

In this position paper, we argue that climate science do- mains can present unique challenges for ML systems given how datasets are collected and generated. In particular, we note that climate datasets used in practice are routinely based onreanalysis orgridding that combine disparate real and simulated/proxy measurement sources. While such a proce- dure ensures that datasets have excellent coverage, it leads to a bias that can propagate within standard ML pipelines. This calls for a rethink of both training and deployment of data- centric ML pipelines for climate science, as well as commu- nity guidelines for dataset and model release. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: in Section 2, we briefly review current data collection practices in climate science and the role of ML in improving climate projections. In Section 3, we present opportunities for aligning machine learning with data practices in climate science, as well as community guidelines for improving the transparency and accountability of ML models. Finally, we conclude in Sec- tion 4 with a summary and discussion on broader impacts, including implications of this research on domains focusing on climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as other disciplines within ML. 2 What Makes Climate Data Unique? Climate modeling is fundamental to understanding the inter- actions between the atmospheric, oceanic, and land surface process, including anthropogenic interventions. Such mod- els can be used for short-term weather forecasts or long-term projections of the Earth’s climate under different interven- tions. Beyond scientific pursuits, the outputs of these models inform regional and international policy aimed at near- and long-term climate mitigation and adaptation. Typically, climate models couple our physical under- standing with on-ground observations. However, such mod- els can be insufficient for certain downstream usecases due to limited accuracy and/or spatiotemporal resolution. For ex- ample, nowcasting requires very short-horizon weather pre- dictions (up to 2 hours ahead) that is greater than the time it takes to spin up numerical weather prediction (NWP) sys- tems (Ravuri et al. 2021). Similarly, many general circula- tion models (GCM) and earth system models (ESM) that areused for projecting future climate operate at a 2 degree reso- lution ( 200km), which is much lower than typically needed (<0.1 degrees) for effective mitigation planning at a regional level (Fowler, Blenkinsop, and Tebaldi 2007). In such scenarios, data-driven solutions involving ma- chine learning can play a big role in overcoming the limi- tations of current climate models. However, the quality of a ML system depends significantly on the availability of high quality datasets. This presents two key challenges.
