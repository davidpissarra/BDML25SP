To model the complex spatial-temporal correlations between charging stations, we argue that Temporal Graph Convolution Models are the most suitable to capture the correlations. The pro- posed Temporal Graph Convolutional Networks provide the most accurate forecasts for short and long-term forecasting compared with other fore- casting methods. 1. Introduction Electric Vehicles (EVs) offer lower carbon emission when compared to gasoline-powered vehicles and can reverse ris- ing emission trends assuming a green energy mix (Miotti et al., 2016; Coignard et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2021). As EV adoption increases and the charging network expands, forecasting the charging demand becomes increasingly es- sential for energy providers seeking to provide green energy to meet the demand (Rolnick et al., 2019). Operators of EV Charging Stations (EVCS) also have a stake in the forecast as they seek to ﬁnd optimal locations for expansion of the infrastructure (Cheon & Kang, 2017; Tao et al., 2018). Forecasting of EV charging demand is generally well stud- ied and explored in the literature, with methods ranging from queuing theory to machine and statistical learning (Khoo et al., 2014; Xydas et al., 2016; Kim & Kim, 2021; Amara- Ouali et al., 2021). Despite this interest in modelling the de- 1Department of Management, Technical University of Den- mark, Lyngby, Denmark. Correspondence to: Fredeirk Boe H ¨uttel <fbohu@dtu.dk >.

Fortunately, we ﬁnd that comments on lack of real-world public data are inaccurate (Kim & Kim, 2021). As high- lighted by (Amara-Ouali et al., 2021), there exist multiple open datasets, which are still underutilized in research. These public datasets provide sufﬁcient data for research and forecasting. The datasets contains both diverse spatial and temporal resolutions. Prominent examples include the city of Palo Alto, U.S. which is on a dense spatial resolution with observations going back to 2011 (CityofPaloAlto, 2021), and the city of Perth, Scotland which spans a spatially sparse area with observations from 2016 to 2019 (PerthandKinross, 2020). Two other prominent datasets are from Boulder, U.S. (Colorado, 2020) and Dundee, Scotland (CityOfDundee, 2019), which again spans a different spatial and temporal resolutions. We propose to use the publicly available data from to forecast the EV charging demand. One of the challenges in forecasting the EV charging de- mand is the complex spatial and temporal dependencies between EVCS (Amara-Ouali et al., 2021). We argue that forecasts of EV charging demand must account for the de- pendencies between the stations, however, this dependence is often neglected by modelling the entire system of EVCS jointly (Kim & Kim, 2021). In recent years there has been increased research into Graph Convolution Network (GCN) which can handle graph-structured data (Kipf & Welling, 2016) and extensions that model temporal graph-structured data (Zhao et al., 2020). We leverage these temporal graph convolutions to capture the complex spatio-temporal cor- relations of the EVCS. The use of temporal GCN is, to our knowledge, previously unexplored in the domain of EV charging demand forecasting. 2. Related work We now provide a brief overview of related works.
