In this direction, we introduce a solution based on EfficientNetV2, namely EfficientTempNet, to increase the temporal resolution of radar-based rainfall products from 10 minutes to 5 minutes. We tested Efficien- tRainNet over a dataset for the state of Iowa, US, and compared its performance to three different baselines to show that EfficientTempNet presents a viable option for better climate change monitoring. 1 I NTRODUCTION The importance of environmental data has grown significantly in recent years due to the increased impact of natural disasters. Rainfall data, in particular, plays a crucial role in various climate modeling applications, such as flood forecasting Sit et al. (2021a); Xiang & Demir (2022), monitoring water quality Jha et al. (2007), or managing wastewater Cahoon & Hanke (2017). Given that the spatial and temporal patterns of rain are crucial in these modeling efforts, having reliable and accessible precipitation maps is vital for advancing research on climate related hazards with different objectives like risk assessment Alabbad et al. (2021) or disaster mitigation Alabbad et al. (2022). Quantitative Precipitation Estimation (QPE) systems provide rainfall data that takes into ac- count three dimensions, which include latitude and longitude as the spatial coordinates and temporal resolution as the third dimension. Weather radars are the primary source used in QPE, and they allow to record the space-time characteristics of precipitation, which is essential for making accurate streamflow predictions in hydrology. Improving rainfall datasets in radar hydrology largely involves addressing uncertainty factors, while the focus is on acquiring more precise precipitation data to enhance our understanding of weather patterns in terms of space and time. However, once the data is obtained, the task of creating better datasets becomes a separate challenge. The temporal resolution of rainfall data is a critical factor in determining the accuracy of predictive modeling efforts (e.g., Atencia et al. (2011)). This paper aims to address the issue of low temporal resolution rainfall products by proposing a convolutional neural network to enhance the temporal resolution of rainfall data. The proposed CNN model, EfficientTempNet, is based on EfficientNetV2 Tan & Le (2021), and the performance of the network is compared to three different methods: the nearest frame, optical flow, and TempNet Sit et al. (2021b). 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 1.1 R ELATED WORK Rainfall products aren’t the only data that is subject to temporal interpolation between two 2D maps. Various studies in computer vision literature were presented employing neural networks based approaches for video frame interpolation Niklaus et al. (2017a;b); Liu et al. (2017); Jiang et al. (2018). Conversely, the literature about how to interpolate time in rainfall datasets is limited. In Seo & Krajewski (2015), researchers used advection correction to create 1-minute rainfall maps from 5-minute ones. Building upon Seo & Krajewski (2015), in Sit et al. (2021b), a residual but simple CNN architecture, namely TempNet, was proposed and was shown to be superior to the dense optical flow-based advection correction method and a non-residual CNN over the IowaRain Sit et al. (2021c) dataset. To the best of our knowledge, TempNet is the only study that tackles the problem of temporal super-resolution of radar rainfall products using neural networks, thus forming the baseline of this study. Consequently, in a similar fashion, in this study, the performance of EfficientTempNet will be presented over the IowaRain dataset to show the increment in performance. The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 introduces the dataset used and provides an overview of the methodology. Section 3 presents and discusses the preliminary results of the comparison between all methods. Finally, Section 4 summarizes the findings. 2 M ETHODS 2.1 D ATA IowaRain Sit et al. (2021c); Seo & Krajewski (2020) is a rainfall event dataset that covers the years of 2016 and 2019 with 5-minute temporal resolution. The dataset covers an area that bounds the state of Iowa and has the size of 1088x1760 pixels with 500m of spatial resolution. In order to meet memory bottlenecks and computational complexity drawbacks, we sampled an area within the IowaRain domain from eastern Iowa that is 768x768 in size; then we averaged the values in the area to downscale the rainmap spatial resolution to 3 km, which effectively changed the rainfall map sizes to 128x128. After the subsampling, the event detection criteria of IowaRain were applied to the new area; 82, 83, 90, and 110 events were obtained for each\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
