Traffic congestion on its own is estimated to cost the average driver around 2000 USD in large cities and, to the United States alone, 305 billion USD in 2017 (1). In particular, “stop-and-go”(SAG) traffic, a common phenomenon in congested traffic, happens when cars traveling on a highway periodically form waves that propagate down the highway, leading cars to constantly accelerate and brake unnecessarily. These SAG waves or events lead to up to 67 percent higher fuel consumption, longer travel times, higher GHG emissions levels, and could be a safety hazard ( 2). Studies have found that SAGs can be responsible for 33-50% of highway driving externalities. (3; 4). However, a promising aspect of this phenomenon is its potential avoidance through proactive iden- tification and subsequent mitigation measures, meaning that there is a significant portion of the congestion that is avoidable. Multiple studies explore how these SAG events form, propagate and dissipate ( 5;6;7;8), and others have shown potential measures to prevent or dissipate them using A Vs (9;2;10), reinforcement learning ( 11), variable speed limits ( 12), etc. These could be empowered by ML approaches that are able to identify, predict, and extract features like congestion, safety-related events, SAGs, and others. ∗These authors contributed equally to this work. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Because of its large impact on the climate, the intersection of transportation, ML, and sustainability research is a promising line of research. However, these models require rich datasets to capture the nuanced dynamics of vehicles, yet there is very limited traffic data available. In the US, the largest highway dataset is the Freeway Performance Measurement System (PeMS), but even for sections of the highway with a dense distribution of sensors, the average distance between sensors is on the order of thousands of feet away, which is not enough for feature extraction and behavior-based analysis. In response, this paper proposes the use of traffic reconstruction as a way to fill in the gaps and generate rich trajectory information to enable complex ML techniques. We apply this framework to a county in California and devise a kernel-based SAG identification method with bootstrapping to provide robust insights on traffic behavior. 2 Related Work The study of stop-and-go events (SAGs) in traffic has a longstanding history, dating back to the 1960s (?). While much of the literature has traditionally focused on fundamental analyses, there has been a discernible shift toward identification methods (?), in part driven by challenges in obtaining sufficient data for large-scale identification. On one hand, theoretical studies encompass dynamic wave modeling, control mechanisms, instabilities, driving models, and other aspects that shed light on triggers, formation, propagation, and dissipation of these waves (?6???????? ; 5; 7; 8). On the other hand, empirical studies focus on identification through various techniques, such as time series and signal processing methods, to identify SAG occurrences in space and time from the observed traffic or vehicle-specific data (???????? ). These approaches typically rely on rich trajectory data that only exists for very few stretches of highway, and only some of them have sufficient resolution to incorporate spatiotemporal features. In contrast, most studies use data from fixed and sparse sensors and identify SAGs using stationary wave processing techniques. In particular, wavelet transformation has been a popular approach for SAG identification (?? ), matching a Mexican hat profile to the signal to identify where this behavior occurs.
