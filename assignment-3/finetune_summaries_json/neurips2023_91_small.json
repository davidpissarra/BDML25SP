This helps inform evacuation efforts by narrowing down target location by 10to20kilometers along both the north-south and east-west directions. 1 Introduction Hurricanes, generally known as tropical cyclones are storm systems characterized by low pressure and high wind speed. These storms lead to physical and financial damage which have been on the rise due to climate change [1]. Identifying their trajectory will inform efficient rescue and evacuation methods by targeting the correct locations. This will reduce the damage to property and life. In this paper we are interested in the task of next location prediction given the trajectory of a hurricane observed at a 6 hourly interval. When such geospatial sequences of extreme weather patterns are observed over a significant period of time an underlying directed graph structure emerges between the different spatial points. While traditional [2] and machine learning based studies [3, 4] for trajectory forecasting show promising results for this task, they typically rely on local context about the trajectory’s past location to perform the prediction task. The global context that can be obtained in the form of a knowledge graph by looking across multiple such trajectories is often under-leveraged. In this paper we provide a general approach based on GraphTransformers for modeling such geospatial sequences where the graph neural network captures the global context from a heuristically constructed knowledge graph and the transformer models the local context from past trajectory points. 2 Related Work For hurricane trajectory prediction traditionally dynamic models, statistical models and statistical- dynamic models have been used. Dynamic models solve physical atmospheric equations using supercomputers whereas statistical models focus on the historic relation between storms features and location. Statistical-dynamic models blend both of the approaches together. Currently, neural network architectures have been employed to address similar tasks of trajectory estimation. Previous work [5]-[9] include using sophisticated deep learning architectures like recurrent neural networks to leverage the sequential storm trajectory, convolutional neural network to utilize satellite imagery data and multimodal approaches [10] combining different data sources. There are also several studies Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Storm trajectories over two centuries of data plotted across Northern America. Significant overlap and intersection in this graph suggest correlation between points across different trajectories, which is under-leveraged in prior work. which discuss the application of a hybrid statistical-deep learning method in forecasting tasks [11]. However, none of these approaches have explicitly leveraged the underlying graph structure for hurricane prediction tasks. Graph neural networks, [12]-[24] are neural networks that are designed to model data that reside in a graph and are extensively used in a wide range of domains such as recommender systems, biomedical sciences, prediction, social media analysis [25]-[31]. Subsequently, transformers[32] have revolutionized the field of sequence modeling and have been used in different machine learning tasks in and outside of NLP such as classification, anomaly detection, translation, time series forecasting etc [33]-[36]. Graph Transformers are a fairly recent development which passes graph nodes as tokens and have been known to give promising results in prediction tasks [37]-[39]. In this paper we leverage the underlying graph structure of the hurricane trajectory using a GraphTransformer, where the transformer component models the trajectory sequential and the graph neural network is used for generating node embeddings 3 Approach 3.1 Dataset Preparation HURDAT dataset contains location and weather information about 2864 storm trajectory sequences collected from 1851 to2015 in North America. We first preprocess the dataset to have training, vali- dation and test splits roughly consisting 80%,10% and10% of the trajectory sequences respectively. We use stratified sampling to do the splits based on the length of the sequence to ensure that the splits cover storm sequences of varying lengths. We then create model input-output pairs ( Xi,Yi) from each sequence by randomly sampling a target location, Yias the model target and using the sequence upto the target token (with a maximum sequence of 16tokens) as the corresponding model input, Xi. We do this to ensure there is no data leakage between the training and the test and validation sets. 3.2 Geospatial Graph Construction We observe by studying several such hurricane trajectory sequences that a natural directed graph structure emerges between different locations where the weight of an edge ( u→v) denotes the likelihood of the storm moving from location uto location vin the next time step. We construct this graph from the training set using a simple heuristic. We first create nodes corresponding to all latitude-longitude pairs in the training set with their latitude-longitude values being the node features. The latitude-longitude values are rounded off to the first decimal place. Then, for every ut in sequence Xiwe add directional edges with weight as follows where ever they are defined. 2W[ut−1→ut] += 1.0 W\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
