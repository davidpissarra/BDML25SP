Monitoring and detecting these events is essential to mitigate their impact on our society. However, traditional drought indices often fail to accurately detect such impacts as they mostly focus on single precursors. In this study, we leverage machine learning algorithms to define a novel data-driven, impact-based drought index reproducing as target the Vegetation Health Index, a satellite signal that di- rectly assesses the vegetation status. We first apply novel dimensionality reduction methods that allow for interpretable spatial aggregation of features related to pre- cipitation, temperature, snow, and lakes. Then, we select the most informative and non-redundant features through filter feature selection. Finally, linear supervised learning methods are considered, given the small number of samples and the aim of preserving interpretability. The experimental setting focuses on ten sub-basins of the Po River basin, but the aim is to design a machine learning-based workflow applicable on a large scale. 1 I NTRODUCTION In recent years, climate change has gained increasing attention both in the media and within the scientific community (Parmesan et al., 2022). An alarming consequence of climate change and global warming is the rising frequency and intensity of droughts (Spinoni et al., 2016), defined as periods of aridity and scarcity of water compared to normal conditions (Van Loon & Van Lanen, 2012), which can have severe economic and ecological effects, impacting agriculture, water resources, tourism, ecosystems, especially in regions lacking effective mitigation and drought management plans (Dai, 2011). In this scenario, the identification of drought-prone conditions and early detection are crucial to mitigate their consequences. Traditional standardized drought indices (e.g., SPI (Guttman, 1999), SPEI (Vicente-Serrano et al., 2010)) are widely used to monitor drought conditions. However, they often fail to detect drought impacts as they focus on specific drivers (e.g., precipitation and evapotranspiration) without account- ing for their complex interactions, that eventually generate the drought’s impacts. Ad hoc index formulations have also been designed to identify drought conditions in specific basins (e.g., Estrela & Vargas (2012)). However, these indices are basin-specific, with no capability to generalize and no automatization of the process, requiring years of expert refinements. As an alternative, indices derived from satellite data are available (e.g., NDVI (Pettorelli, 2013), VHI (Bento et al., 2018)) and allow the direct observation of vegetation status in terms of colors, making them more suitable proxies of its condition. Yet, these indices can only be observed in real-time, preventing their prediction weeks to months in advance (Meehl et al., 2021) to timely prompt anticipatory operations. ∗paolo.bonetti@polimi.it 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 Recent works applied Machine Learning to automatically derive data-driven drought indices, exploit- ing classical indices as proxies of drought conditions (e.g., (Zaniolo et al., 2018; Feng et al., 2019; Dikshit et al., 2021)). Building on these works, we apply a similar data-driven workflow in the Po River basin (Italy), which is the largest Italian catchment and the most populated area of the country. This region plays a central role in the national economy, and it is one of the largest agricultural areas in Europe. In this context, we consider the remotely sensed Vegetation Health Index (V ogt et al., 2000, VHI) as a proxy of the state of vegetation impacted by drought conditions. The novel contribution of this work resides on the interpretability of each step of the ML workflow proposed. Indeed, this work is the first empirical validation of recent dimensionality reduction algorithms (theoretically presented in (Bonetti et al., 2024; 2023), designed to obtain interpretable spatially aggregated features. Then, filter feature selection through conditional mutual information (CMI) is used to select the relevant and non-redundant features as candidate drivers. Finally, linear supervised learning models are trained, also considering a multi-task setting, in order to define a new data-driven, impact-based drought index (i.e., the resulting model) reproducing the state of vegetation impacted by the drought. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed workflow, whose main contribution is not only in terms of regression performances but also in terms of index interpretability, which is essential to bridge the gap between advanced ML methods (often considered as black-box algorithms) and the physical meaning of the results. 2 D ATA The VHI is a satellite index available in eight-day aggregations and 231m spatial resolution (Zellner & Castelli, 2022).
