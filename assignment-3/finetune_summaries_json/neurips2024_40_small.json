Self-Organizing Maps, an unsupervised neural network, is used to 6 learn the indicators attributed to energy burden to inform public policy. This is 7 one of the first studies to consider environmental justice indicators, which include 8 outdoor air quality metrics and health disparities as energy burden indicators. The 9 results show significant ( p < 0.05) differences among high energy burden areas 10 and those with no energy burden for the environmental justice indicators. Thus, 11 beyond the socioeconomic hardships of marginalized communities, counties with 12 high energy burden suffer from environmental and health hazards, which will be 13 amplified under a changing climate. 14 1 Introduction 15 Governing bodies at the local, state, and federal levels have recognized the challenges climate 16 change brings for traditionally marginalized communities. However, how to create equitable and just 17 public policies at the confluence of climate change, energy, and disadvantaged communities remains 18 a complex question [ 1] with a dearth of research [ 2]. When creating public policy, meaningful 19 indicators, including social indicators, are vital to well-informed policies. Well-informed policies 20 are knowledge-influenced, meaning indicators have been thoroughly understood before creating the 21 policy. Otherwise, it is purely a political policy [ 3]. Since energy impacts almost every dimension of 22 modern society, when access to energy is limited, these impacts are compounded through housing, 23 mobility, health, work, education, and other facets of life [ 4]. Energy resource access plays a vital 24 role as compounded climate and electric infrastructure events occur. For example, the 2021 winter 25 blackout in Texas left approximately 10 million people without electricity for as long as multiple 26 days. Many news outlets reported that minority neighborhoods were disproportionately impacted 27 [5]. While there are many constructs regarding inequality in the energy ecosystem, reviewed and 28 compared in [4] and [6], this paper will focus on Energy Burden provided in Eq. 1. 29 Energy Burden (%) =Energy Bills ($) Income ($)(1) Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.The United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE) states that households experiencing an energy 30 burden of 6%or greater are considered to have a high energy burden, and households with an energy 31 burden of 10% or higher have a severe energy burden. These metrics were created based on the notion 32 that a household should not spend more than 30% of the income on housing expenses, and utility 33 costs should not exceed 20% of housing expenses, although this often does not include transportation 34 energy or water use [ 7,8]. A high energy burden can result in shutoffs and “bundled burdens” such 35 that economic trade-offs create a cumulative household risk. Trade-offs include living in comprised 36 homes and the “heat or eat” phenomena, which refers to the co-occurrence of food and energy 37 insecurity [ 9]. However, co-occurrences are not limited to energy and food but include medical care, 38 proper shelter, and other life necessities. As global air temperatures continue to rise due to climate 39 change, there is a precedent to predict how household energy use will change. An example is the 2022 40 California Heatwave, which led to the California Independent System Operator setting a new peak 41 demand. The Western Interconnection also set a new peak demand in July 2024 [ 10]. Findings from 42 [11] suggest that many areas will experience an increase in air conditioning (AC) expenditures but a 43 decrease in heating expenditures as year-round temperatures are projected to increase. This creates 44 a continuous need for increased use and adoption of AC in residential buildings [ 12]. However, 45 previous studies have often concentrated on the interconnections of heating energy consumption, 46 poverty, and residential dwellings. As such, this study focuses on the summer season, using summer 47 temperature data and investigating AC types in residential buildings in the U.S. Western Census 48 Region. The contributions of this study include: 49 •Understanding the implications of energy burden beyond energy use, social demographics, 50 and income. These metrics are included in a majority of previous studies. While this paper 51 does include those metrics, it is one of the first studies to include environmental justice 52 indicators and resiliency measures. 53 •The development of a data-driven framework to identify energy burden indicators that are 54 flexible to new inputs or different geographic regions. 55 •Poses to answer the question “What indicators are important in developing well-informed 56 policies for energy burdened areas?\" 57 2 Methods 58 The purpose of using unsupervised learning is to form groupings using general patterns and dist\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
