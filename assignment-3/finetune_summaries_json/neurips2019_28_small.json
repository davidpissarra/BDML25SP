To resolve the potential displacement between solar panels in the exemplar image and that in the target image, we use a cross-correlation module to collate the spatial features learned from each input and measure their similarity. Experimental result shows that our model signiﬁcantly outperforms baseline methods on a dataset of historical LR images collected in California. 1 Introduction Solar installations are growing worldwide at a rapid pace [ 1], which contributes to the decarbonization of the energy sector and ultimately helps our world address climate change. However, a high-ﬁdelity time-series solar installation database is still unavailable at a granular level (e.g. neighborhood or borough level), which prohibits the comprehensive analysis of solar adoption behaviors and impedes the further promotion and policymaking on solar energy across the world. OpenPV [ 2] reports incomplete, course-grained, and inefﬁcient-to-update solar installation records in the U.S. based on voluntary contribution. DeepSolar [ 3] used a deep learning method to automatically detect solar installation in high-resolution (HR) satellite images and thus constructed a nationwide solar installation database efﬁciently, yet without any information of installation trends. To bridge this gap, one option is to apply machine learning on historical imagery to identify the installation time of existing solar panels. However, historical satellite imagery such as NAIP and OneAtlas all feature: (1) low resolution (usually >1m), which is difﬁcult even for human eyes to recognize a solar panel, (2) object displacement across images of different years at the same location, and (3) lack of datapoints in some years requiring combining multiple image sources with different resolution, color distribution, and noise distribution to cover a whole time series. An image sequence example shown in Figure 1(a) demonstrates the challenge in solving this problem with machine learning methods. To tackle such issues, we propose a deep siamese network to identify solar panels in historical LR “target” image which takes both the target image and a HR “exemplar” image at the same location as inputs. The identiﬁcation is applied only on locations where existing solar installation has been spotted and thus a HR exemplar image with solar installation must be available. Our method is inspired by the fact that in many cases even humans cannot identify solar panels in a LR image, but can compare it with HR image at the same location to make decisions. We demonstrate our method on a real-world historical LR image dataset, and hope that our method will enable the construction of \u0003Equal contribution 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.a highly granular time-series solar installation database that facilitates: (1) researchers for conducting ﬁne-grained solar adoption trend analysis, (2) solar developer for promoting PV sales with smarter strategies, (3) policymakers for designing and estimating the effects of renewable energy incentives, and eventually enhances the positive impact of solar energy on ﬁghting climate change.

However, a high-fidelity time-series solar installation database is still unavailable at a granular level (e.g., neighborhood or borough level), hindering comprehensive analysis of solar adoption behaviors and impeding the promotion and policymaking of solar energy worldwide. OpenPV reports incomplete, coarse-grained, and inefficient solar installation records in the U.S. based on voluntary contributions. DeepSolar used a deep learning method to automatically detect solar installations in HR satellite images and constructed a nationwide solar installation database efficiently, but without information on installation trends.\n\nTo bridge this gap, one option is to apply machine learning on historical imagery to identify the installation time of existing solar panels. However, historical satellite imagery, such as NAIP and OneAtlas, feature low resolution (usually >1m), object displacement across images of different years at the same location, and a lack of datapoints in some years, requiring the combination of multiple image sources with different resolution, color distribution, and noise distribution to cover a whole time series. An image sequence example demonstrates the challenge in solving this problem with machine learning methods.\n\nTo tackle these issues, a deep Siamese network is proposed to identify solar panels in historical LR \"target\" images, taking both the target image and a HR \"exemplar\" image at the same location as inputs. The identification is applied only on locations where existing solar installation has been spotted, and a HR exemplar image with solar installation must be available. The method is inspired by the fact that even humans cannot identify solar panels in a LR image but can compare it with a HR image at the same location to make decisions.\n\nThe proposed method is demonstrated on a real-world historical LR image dataset, and it is hoped that the method will enable the construction of a highly granular time-series solar installation database that facilitates:\n\n1.
