For example, clouds have a tremendous impact on short-term predictions or ’nowcasts’ of solar irradiance and can be used to optimize solar power plants and effectively exploit solar energy. However even today, cloud observation requires the intervention of highly-trained professionals to document their findings, which introduces bias. To overcome these issues and contribute to climate change technology, we propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first two transformer-based models applied to cloud data tasks. We use the CCSD Cloud classification dataset and achieve 90.06% accuracy, outperforming all other methods. To demonstrate the robustness of transformers in this domain, we perform Cloud segmentation on SWIMSWG dataset and achieve 83.2% IoU, also outperforming other methods. With this, we signal a potential shift away from pure CNN networks. 1 Introduction Nearly 60% of the Earth surface is covered by clouds ( 8) and thus, are crucial in regulating the Earth’s radiation budget, weather forecasting, climate studies, water cycle and many other natural phenomena. ( 5) shows that cloud type variations induce radiative flux changes, which in turn influence changes in climate. Technological intervention into understanding clouds has a tremendous variety of applications to ameliorate climate change. Accurate cloud type detection and segmentation can be crucial in building optimized solar energy power plants.( 11) Hourly temporal fluctuation in shortwave solar irradiance is primarily caused by cloud cover, which is difficult to predict because of its variability ( 9). Thus, to create optimal solar grids, accurate ’nowcasts’ that predict short-term variations is essential. Additionally, this would help reduce the burden on the plant’s energy storage capacity as batteries could be used more flexibly ( 9). Thus, this technology plays a vital part in maintaining the shift towards renewable solar energy. Cloud classification techniques are also key to identification of dangerous weather hazards. Weather prediction systems, convective current models, and rainfall estimation systems all benefit from accurate cloud identification ( 18). With more than 11,000 natural disasters causing over two million deaths and USD 3.64 trillion in economic damage — all between 1970 and 2019 (nearly a 5x ∗Equal Contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021.increase) ( 10), this can be a crucial technological intervention. Cloud segmentation is important to understand the impact of cloud cover; estimation of local temperature and photo-voltaic power output in the area would be possible. Ground-based cloud tasks on images taken from Earth’s ground-level have been explored extensively in recent literature ( 13). However, in most practical systems, it still requires heavy manual intervention of domain experts. This subjectivity in evaluation process impacts large-scale projects with the because of inherent biases and uncertainties. To reduce the burden on domain experts and produce reliable technological intervention, classical ML and DL-based classification and segmentation algorithms have emerged. The last few years have witnessed a tremendous rise in CNN-based image classification and seg- mentation research ( 17). However, CNNs have been known to suffer from large inductive biases. In particular, locality and translation equivariance are crucial components of a CNN. These assumptions hurt the interpretability of CNN algorithms. Of late, visual transformer-based approaches have gained massive traction for image classification, segmentation and object detection tasks ( 1;15;20;2). They have been known to challenge some of these assumptions while maintaining comparable performance. In this work, we propose a pure visual transformer: CloudViT and a hybrid CNN-Transformer: CloudUT to tackle cloud classification on the Cirrus Cumulus Stratus Nimbus Dataset (CCSN) ( 18) and cloud segmentation on the SWIMSWG Dataset ( 6) respectively. We achieve state-of-the-art results in both tasks and therefore note that the discriminative power of the transformer-driven approach for the first time (to the best of our knowledge) in this domain. However keeping quantiative results aside, this approach maintains the neighbourhood structure during the generation of patch embeddings, and thus does not induce spatial biases since all inter-patch dependencies are learnt from scratch. This means that the aforementioned inductive biases do not occur throughout the network, unlike for CNNs. Crucially, this improves the robustness of our approach. 2 Methodology We approach the cloud classification task as a multi-class classification problem. Given an input cloud image, our pure transformer model CloudViT outputs a label prediction. We approach the segmentation task to achieve classification at a granular level. Our hybrid model CloudUT outputs a dense label prediction for every pixel, dividing them into distinct regions.
