Measuring inequity in the energy system is a formidable task since it is large scale and the data is coming from abundant data sources. In this work, we lay out a plan to leverage and develop scalable machine learning (ML) tools to measure the equity of the current energy system and to facilitate a just transition to a clean energy system.

Introduction The current energy system is steeped in inequities. Peo- ple of color and people with low incomes are especially vulnerable to serious negative impacts from the way we gen- erate, store, transmit, use, and invest in energy (Jessel et al., 2019). Polluting power plants are more likely to be located in low-income and under-represented communities. In a crisis, power is restored last for minority neighborhoods, e.g., the recent blackout in Texas (Dobbins & Tabuchi, Feb 2021). High electricity and heating fuel bills due to poor en- ergy efﬁciency are a major burden for low-income minority households, and are becoming even more onerous during the COVID-19 crisis (Graff & Carley, 2020). As energy system transitions to a low carbon one to respond to climate change, we must intentionally build an equitable system that not only reduces harm but enables wealth cre- ation in the communities that most need it. Planning for a just transition requires negotiating between many compet- ing demands and tradeoffs. Understanding the aggregate economic, health and environmental impacts of energy deci- sions is already difﬁcult; when equity is a priority, this is an even greater challenge. There are signs that the underserved communities vulnerable to adverse energy impacts today may be cut out of beneﬁts of the energy transition, or even further harmed. For example, subsidies for rooftop solar installations disproportionately beneﬁt higher-income suburban homeowners; yet the sur- charges to fund them raise everyone’s energy bills, further burdening people who already spend a large portion of their income on energy costs (Roth, June 2020). To mitigate this inequity, there are nation-wide programs around the world, such as Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) (De- partment of Energy, 2021b) or Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) (Department of Energy, Ac- cessed January 2021) both in the U.S., with ﬁscal budgets above $3 billion (Department of Energy, 2021a). However, according to DataKind (DataKind, 2021), a major challenge in these programs is on how to efﬁciently allocate these funds to the communities that most need it. To respond this challenge, some organizations have begun to identify measures of interest; the Energy Justice Scorecard fromLeveraging Machine Learning for An Equitable Transition in Energy Systems the Institute for Energy Justice (Institute for Energy Justice, 2021), for example, allows for the evaluation of individual policies for their equitable process and impacts. In another initiative, the policymakers in the New York State are insur- ing beneﬁts of clean energy initiatives reach disadvantaged communities (NYSERDA, 2021). These solutions, however, are labor-intensive and limited in scale. In this work, we lay out initial ideas on how one can develop scalable, replicable, and practical ML tools to improve the justice in the current energy system and more importantly, ensure equitable tran- sition of energy systems. Our vision is that this research will inform policies to induce green growth, reduce pollution, and encourage decentralized energy ownership and commu- nity representation. The high availability of the public data used in our approach allows the usage of machine learning tools in energy equity in an expansive set of locations. To highlight the potential of ML for scalable and replicable enhancement of energy equity, in this work, we focus on two concrete applications and explain the challenges of develop- ing ML tools for both.

This work outlines a plan to leverage and develop scalable machine learning (ML) tools to measure the equity of the current energy system and facilitate a just transition to a clean energy system. We focus on two concrete examples. First, we explore how ML can help measure the inequity in energy inefficiencies of residential houses at the scale of a town or a country. Second, we examine how deep learning techniques can help estimate the solar potential of residential buildings to facilitate a just installation and incentive allocation of solar panels. The application of ML for energy equity is broader than these examples, and we highlight additional areas of focus.\n\nThe results of this research can be used by policymakers to efficiently allocate energy assistance subsidies in the current energy systems and ensure justice in their energy transition plans.\n\nThe current energy system is plagued by inequities. People of color and those with low incomes are disproportionately affected by the negative impacts of energy generation, storage, transmission, use, and investment. Polluting power plants are more likely to be located in low-income and underrepresented communities. In times of crisis, power is often restored last for minority neighborhoods, as seen in the recent Texas blackout. High electricity and heating fuel bills due to poor energy efficiency are a significant burden for low-income minority households, particularly during the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nAs the energy system transitions to a low-carbon system to address climate change, it is essential to build an equitable system that not only reduces harm but also enables wealth creation in the communities that need it most. Planning for a just transition requires balancing competing demands and trade-offs. Understanding the aggregate economic, health, and environmental impacts of energy decisions is challenging; prioritizing equity makes it even more complex.\n\nThere are signs that underserved communities vulnerable to adverse energy impacts may be excluded from the benefits of the energy transition or even further harmed. For example, subsidies for rooftop solar installations disproportionately benefit higher-income suburban homeowners, while the surcharges to fund them increase energy bills for everyone, further burdening those who already spend a large portion of their income on energy costs.\n\nTo mitigate this inequity, there are nationwide programs, such as the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP) and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), with budgets exceeding $3 billion. However, a major challenge is efficiently allocating these funds to the communities that need them most. To address this challenge, some organizations have developed measures of interest, such as the Energy Justice Scorecard from the Institute for Energy Justice, which evaluates individual policies for their equitable process and impacts.
