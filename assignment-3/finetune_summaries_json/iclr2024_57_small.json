This increases the complexity of the power system in many as- pects, including the power grid and its dynamics. As millions of consumers and thousands of (volatile) generators are connected to the same synchronous grid, no simple bottom-up models describing the dynamics are available on a continental scale comprising all of these necessary details. Hence, to identify this unknown power grid dynamics, we propose to leverage the Sparse Identification of Non- linear Dynamics (SINDy) method. Thereby, we unveil the governing equations underlying the dynamical system directly from data measurements. Investigating the power grids of Iceland, Ireland and the Balearic islands as sample systems, we observe structurally similar dynamics with remarkable differences in both quan- titative and qualitative behavior. Overall, we show how complex, i.e. non-linear, noisy, and time-dependent, dynamics can be identified straightforwardly. 1 I NTRODUCTION Power systems are presently experiencing a swift shift toward a more environmentally sustainable future, which is crucial in mitigating climate change. The stable functioning of our society relies heavily on the electrical power system and the maintenance of a stable power grid, transporting power from distributed generators to consumers. The power grid frequency,is a crucial indicator of the equilibrium between electricity supply and demand, serving as a vital factor in the reliability of power systems (Machowski et al., 2020). Power grid frequency typically remains within a few percentage points of its reference value of 50 Hz or 60 Hz, respectively (Rydin Gorj ˜ao et al., 2020). Deviations from these respective standard frequencies indicate an imbalance of the system and can cause additional costs for grid operators as control systems need to be activated. Hence, understand- ing, modeling, and forecasting power grid frequency dynamics and statistics is crucial (Rydin Gorj ˜ao et al., 2020). Power grids are complex systems: They are driven by both stochastic and deterministic influences, i.e. our modelling has to cope with potentially time-dependent and noisy dynamics. Furthermore, while many control laws are linear by design (Machowski et al., 2020), their interplay might lead to non-linear effective equations (Oberhofer et al., 2023; Wen et al., 2023). To address these chal- lenges, we require an accessible, flexible, and data-driven approach, to derive linear and nonlinear differential models of the power grid frequency. In the current study, we aim to answer the question: Can Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynam- ics (SINDy) (Brunton et al., 2016a) identify the complex dynamics of the power grid frequency? The SINDy methodology estimates the most relevant parameters of the governing equations for dynamical systems and has seen diverse applications across fields including stochastic dynamics, physics-informed models, biological networks, control systems, and power system state estimation (Boninsegna et al., 2018; Callaham et al., 2021; Champion et al., 2020; Mangan et al., 2016; Brunton 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024 et al., 2016b; Stankovi ´c et al., 2020; Khazaei & Hosseinipour, 2023). However, many previously considered (power) systems are comparatively simple dynamic systems. The main contribution of the present paper is the focus on uniquely complex time series from power systems, both synthetic and empirical. In contrast to dynamic systems such as the Lorenz attractor investigated in Brunton et al. (2016a), the time series investigated in the present paper are characterized not only by non- linearity but also include strong noise and time-dependent dynamics (Oberhofer et al., 2023). While previous studies (Lore et al., 2023; Sch ¨on et al., 2022) only considered time-dependent coefficients for SINDy, we advance the state of the art by including time as an explicit variable in the model.
