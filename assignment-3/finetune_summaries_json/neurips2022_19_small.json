We evaluate the algorithm on a realistic two-generator system, where it exhibits robustness to distribution shift while enabling improved efficiency as renewable penetration increases. 1 Introduction The need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic climate change is driving an energy transition characterized by large amounts of renewable generation resources being added to the grid. During this transition, the variability of solar and wind energy will require the operation of dispatchable generation to balance out the fluctuations in renewable energy production and maintain reliable grid operation. However, conventional fossil fuel generators incur significant added costs from the frequent cycling and ramping they must perform under high penetration of renewables, due both to decreased fuel efficiency and increased operations/maintenance required from operating in this regime [29]. Moreover, most dispatchable resources are limited in their ramp rate, and thus under high penetration of renewables they must be operated in a manner that anticipates system ramp needs, taking into account the high costs of frequent ramping while still meeting demand. Operating generation optimally requires minimizing fuel costs while taking account of intertemporal coupling of decisions, including both ramp costs and ramp limits. A natural approach for this problem is model predictive control (MPC), an algorithm that utilizes near-term forecasts of demand and other conditions to choose decisions that minimize aggregate cost over a fixed lookahead horizon [20]. In addition to theoretical work confirming its good performance [ 16], MPC works well in practice and has been studied in a number of energy and sustainability-related domains, including control of wind turbines and solar photovoltaics [ 17,28], smart buildings [ 11,3], and energy storage [19,21]. Moreover, several regional power system operators in the US use MPC to settle the real- time electricity market [ 7], and it is widely understood that such lookahead algorithms will play an Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.increasingly important role in enabling power systems to reliably absorb renewable energy volatility [9, 31]. However, MPC suffers computational complexity exponential in the lookahead horizon if the system model/costs are nonconvex, necessitating the use in practice of heuristic solvers that operate on a faster timescale but generally produce suboptimal decisions [ 10,6,2]. One promising avenue for overcoming the computational complexity of nonconvex MPC to enable improved performance in practice is the development of machine learning (ML) models that imitate its behavior, bypassing the need to solve an independent nonconvex optimization problem to generate each decision. This approach of “learning to control/optimize” has seen wide recent interest in the ML, control, and power systems communities [ 13,24,27,8,23,22]. However, these learning-based approaches come with no a priori guarantees on their incurred cost under distribution shift or on out-of-sample problem instances, jeopardizing their performance at deployment time. To counter this potential for poor performance and enable confident deployment of ML proxies for MPC in real-world settings, this work proposes an algorithm to robustify the behavior of such an ML proxy. We follow the paradigm of the emerging learning-augmented algorithms literature (e.g., [ 18,25,14]), specifically building upon the line of work [ 1,26,5,15] designing algorithms for online optimization with switching costs (a generalization of the dispatch problem) that can exploit the performance of an MLalgorithm while providing worst-case guarantees on cost. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose a learning-augmented algorithm ROBUST MLfor online optimization with switching costs that achieves the best deterministic performance bound in the setting of general nonconvex cost functions. Specifically, when provided with an ML algorithm for the problem as well as a heuristic baseline algorithm, for any desired ϵ, δ > 0, our algorithm achieves cost at most (1 +ϵ+δ)times the cost incurred by the ML algorithm, while maintaining a worst-case cost bond of O(C δ+D ϵ), where Cis the cost of the heuristic baseline and Dis the diameter of the decision space.
