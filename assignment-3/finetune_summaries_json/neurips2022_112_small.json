To achieve the “sustainable intensification” of agriculture, transforming it from carbon emitter to carbon sink is a priority, and understanding the environmental impact of agricultural management practices is a fundamental prerequisite to that. At the same time, the global agricultural landscape is deeply heterogeneous, with differences in climate, soil, and land use inducing variations in how agricultural systems respond to farmer actions. The “personalization” of sustainable agriculture with the provision of locally adapted management advice is thus a necessary condition for the efficient uplift of green metrics, and an integral development in imminent policies. Here, we formulate personalized sustainable agriculture as a Conditional Average Treatment Effect estimation task and use Causal Machine Learning for tackling it. Leveraging climate data, land use information and employing Double Machine Learning, we estimate the heterogeneous effect of sustainable practices on the field-level Soil Organic Carbon content in Lithuania. We thus provide a data-driven perspective for targeting sustainable practices and effectively expanding the global carbon sink. 1 Introduction Climate change poses a multidimensional, complex challenge to humankind. In this context, agricul- ture faces a unique situation. On the one hand, production must keep rising up to meet ever-increasing demands [1], a task that is significantly complicated by inflation, crises, and extreme, unpredictable events [2,3,4]. On the other hand, it must do so in a sustainable way. Owing to decades of scientific research, the consequences of environmentally oblivious agricultural practices are by now well understood [5,6]. A unique opportunity also surfaced; since agricultural land comprises 38% of the global land surface [7], agriculture offers a clear path towards mitigating climate change, by maximizing the carbon that crops naturally sequester, thus creating a substantial carbon sink [8]. As a result, insights on the impacts of sustainable agricultural practices, especially with regards to their effect on Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) are invaluable, not only for sustainability purposes, but also for the reliability, fairness, and transparency of modern agricultural carbon markets. At the same time, the global agricultural landscape contains significant diversity in terms of climate, soil, and land use. Such diversity of agricultural ecosystems frequently results in heterogeneous responses to interventions carried out by farmers; as an example, the effect of fertilizers on soil organic matter may Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.differ depending on soil pH [9]. This reality is now recognized and reflected on high-stakes policy making. In an effort to ensure a sustainable future, the latest iteration of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union explicitly provides greater flexibility for adapting its measures to local conditions [10]. From the perspective of artificial intelligence, such endeavor entails a personalization problem, where the end goal is to provide the farmer with targeted advice, depending on the particular farming context, on best practices to use in order to uplift sustainable metrics, such as SOC, and e.g., reimburse them accordingly. In this context, causal Machine Learning (ML) can efficiently leverage big Earth Observation (EO) data and other agricultural information in order to arrive at quantitative insights on the impacts of sustainable agriculture. Due to the large geographical coverage attained by EO, such methods can estimate effect heterogeneity even at the field-level, hence providing personalized and truly actionable advice towards sustainability goals. In this paper, we apply causal ML to understand the heterogeneous response of SOC content to a sustainable agriculture program and showcase a methodology for its personalization. 2 Related Work Over the past decade, ML methods have made significant contributions in a variety of important tasks, including yield prediction, or pest, weed, and disease detection [11]. While such work has been fundamental in advancing precision agriculture, it is primarily based on predictive, correlation- based models, and is hence inadequate for assessing causal relations. Recently, works that aim to explicitly model cause and effect have been published. Enabled by large-scale EO data, among other sources, researchers have used new causal ML methods to infer the impact of conservation tillage on yield [12], or assess the suitability of agricultural land for applying crop rotation and diversification [13]. Causal forests [14] have been employed [15] for evaluating the environmental effectiveness of various agri-environment schemes [16]. However, results were obtained either on a lower spatial resolution, hindering the field-level personalization of advice [12, 13], or for a single year only [15], impeding the capture of slow, long-term environmental dynamics, such as those characterising soil [17]. Here, we utilize field-level SOC predictions and other geospatial data to propose a multi-year, fully personalized framework for assessing the effect of sustainable practices on SOC content and guide decision-making. We report preliminary results for a case study in Lithuania. 3 Data and Methods Dataset.
