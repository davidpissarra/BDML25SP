Their presence in aquatic ecosystems highlights 4 the link between human activity and the hydrological cycle. They also disrupt 5 aquatic life, interfere with gas exchange, and disturb the carbon cycle, contributing 6 to greenhouse gas emissions and exacerbating climate change. Federal agencies, 7 state governments and non-government research and public interest organizations 8 have emphasized the need for documenting the sites and the extent of PFAS con- 9 tamination. However, the time-consuming and expensive nature of data collection 10 and analysis poses challenges. It hinders the rapid identification of locations at 11 high risk of PFAS contamination, which may then require further sampling or 12 remediation. To address this data limitation, our study leverages a novel geospatial 13 dataset, machine learning models including frameworks such as Random Forest, 14 IBM-NASA’s Prithvi and UNet, and geospatial analysis to predict regions with 15 high PFAS concentrations in surface water. Using fish data from the National 16 Rivers and Streams Assessment (NRSA) dataset by the Environmental Protection 17 Agency (EPA), our analysis suggests the potential value of machine learning based 18 models for targeted deployment of sampling investigations and remediation efforts. 19 1 Background and Motivation 20 PFAS are a group of over 9,000 synthetic chemicals first manufactured in the late 1940s. Known for 21 their exceptional stability and resistance to degradation, PFAS are often termed \"forever chemicals\" 22 due to their persistence in the environment and tendency to bioaccumulate in living organisms. These 23 chemicals are found in the blood of 97% of Americans, according to the CDC, and have contaminated 24 the drinking water of over 110 million people in the U.S. alone [ 1] - [2]. Human exposure to 25 Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.PFAS occurs through various pathways, including contaminated food, drinking water, air, household 26 products, and dust. Exposure to some PFAS is associated with serious health issues, including 27 cancer. Additionally, some PFAS are classified as fluorinated greenhouse gases (F-GHGs), which 28 are typically the most powerful and enduring greenhouse gases [ 3]. Inefficient waste management 29 practices involving PFAS-containing materials have further contributed to their widespread pollution 30 [4]. 31 Given the complexity of environmental and health risks like those posed by PFAS, artificial intelli- 32 gence (AI) has the potential to be a powerful tool to help identify the scope of contamination and 33 areas of highest priority for remediation. There is precedence that AI has the potential to automate 34 labor-intensive tasks, more strategically utilize and benefit from domain expertise, and derive valuable 35 insights from complex datasets, in domains ranging from conservation, to health, to agriculture [ 5]. 36 These domains also frequently use geospatial and remote sensing data for tasks such as land cover 37 mapping [6], disease prediction [7], and agricultural productivity assessments [8]. 38 In the context of PFAS contamination, spatial analysis has been employed to map pollution sources 39 like industrial facilities and waste management areas [ 9], predict PFAS levels in fish tissue, and 40 assess contamination risks at specific sites [ 10]. Recent work has also focused on predicting PFAS 41 contamination in groundwater at a national scale [ 11]. Despite these advancements, many spatial 42 analysis methods remain labor-intensive and require significant domain knowledge, which can hinder 43 their scalability and efficiency. 44 Our study aims to address these limitations by comparing different machine learning models and 45 data processing techniques. These include advanced models like IBM-NASA’s Prithvi [ 12] and 46 UNet [ 13], as well as traditional models like Random Forest [ 14], coupled with a novel geospatial 47 dataset to predict PFAS concentrations in surface water. By integrating diverse data sources, including 48 environmental and industrial factors, our predictive models identify areas at high risk of contamination. 49 These models, once further validated by field sampling, can help guide environmental policy and 50 intervention efforts in real time. 51 2 Methods 52 2.1 Dataset processing 53 Our study focuses on classifying high and low PFAS concentrations in the U.S. using fish tissue 54 PFAS concentration data from the NRSA [ 15] dataset.
