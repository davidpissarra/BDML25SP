Introduction Climate-related ﬁnancial disclosures aim at increasing the transparency to guide investment and lending decisions in the ﬁnancial sector. They reﬂect not only the physical ef- fects of a changing climate, also the transition processes to decarbonize the economy that bear ﬁnancial risks and opportunities. Such transition risks and opportunities in- clude policy and legal change, technology and market shifts, and reputation-related risks ( ClimateWise,2019 ;Semieniuk et al.,2020 ). Transition risks are found to be more immi- nent than physical risks from climate change, and there are indications that some of those risks are already ﬁnancially priced ( K¨olbel et al.,2020 ). In fact, the G20 Financial Sta- bility Board has established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to issue recommendations for disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities (CRO) 1Department of Economics, University of Bern, Bern, Switzer- land2Department of Humanities, Social and Political Sciences, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland3Institute of Science, Tech- nology, and Policy, ETH Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland4Mila – Quebec AI Institute, Montreal, Canada.

However, recent anal- yses of the current standard of reporting have found insufﬁ- cient clarity of CRO reporting (meaning that disclosures are not speciﬁc enough to allow a judgement whether CRO are material, i.e. signiﬁcant, for future ﬁnancial performance), with some recent improvements ( TCFD,2019 ;Climate Dis- closure Standards Board (CDSB),2020 ;Demaria & Rigot, 2019 ). To establish more stringent reporting standards on CRO, policy makers and ﬁnancial regulators have begun establishing regulations ( Steffen,2021 ), for example the 2014 EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (EU directive 2014/95/EU) and subsequent guidelines (2017/C 215/01 and 2019/C 209/01) ( EUR-Lex ), Art. 173 of the French Energy Transitions law from 2015 ( French Republic,2015 ), and a recent Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk in the US ( The White House,2021 ). To monitor the state of climate-related disclosure and es- tablish the effectiveness of related regulation, ﬁnancial re- ports need to be analyzed to assess the extent and quality of such disclosures by companies and organizations.

Second, there are equity concerns if CROs of smaller companies are not monitored (e.g., they could experience signiﬁcant transition-related opportunities but investments are not directed to them).

Introduction\n\nClimate-related financial disclosures aim to increase transparency to guide investment and lending decisions in the financial sector. They reflect not only the physical effects of a changing climate but also the transition processes to decarbonize the economy that bear financial risks and opportunities. Such transition risks and opportunities include policy and legal change, technology and market shifts, and reputation-related risks (ClimateWise, 2019; Semieniuk et al., 2020). Transition risks are found to be more imminent than physical risks from climate change, and there are indications that some of those risks are already financially priced (Kolbel et al., 2020). The G20 Financial Stability Board has established a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) to issue recommendations for disclosure of climate-related risks and opportunities (CRO). The TCFD has established guidelines for corporate reporting (TCFD, 2019). However, recent analyses of the current standard of reporting have found insufficient clarity of CRO reporting, meaning that disclosures are not specific enough to allow a judgment whether CRO are material for future financial performance, with some recent improvements (TCFD, 2019; Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), 2020; Demaria & Rigot, 2019).\n\nTo establish more stringent reporting standards on CRO, policymakers and financial regulators have begun establishing regulations. For example, the 2014 EU Non-Financial Reporting Directive (EU directive 2014/95/EU) and subsequent guidelines (2017/C 215/01 and 2019/C 209/01) (EUR-Lex), Article 173 of the French Energy Transitions law from 2015 (French Republic, 2015), and a recent Executive Order on Climate-Related Financial Risk in the US (The White House, 2021).\n\nTo monitor the state of climate-related disclosure and establish the effectiveness of related regulation, financial reports need to be analyzed to assess the extent and quality of such disclosures by companies and organizations. Typically, these analyses are conducted manually, which is time-intensive. Recent examples covered only the 40 (Demaria & Rigot, 2019) and 50 largest companies (Climate Disclosure Standards Board (CDSB), 2020) of different listings. Constraining the analysis to only a small set of the largest companies risks introducing bias or preventing important insights. First, the financially strongest companies might not sufficiently represent sectors that are most relevant for low-carbon transitions (e.g., most freight shipping companies are typically very small, while having a significant carbon footprint (Teter et al., 2017)). Second, there are equity concerns if CROs of smaller companies are not monitored (e.g., they could experience significant transition-related opportunities but investments are not directed to them). This bias might cause the financial impacts of climate change and transitions to be incorrectly priced, and result in an inefficient allocation of capital during the low-carbon transition (Semieniuk et al., 2020).\n\n2.
