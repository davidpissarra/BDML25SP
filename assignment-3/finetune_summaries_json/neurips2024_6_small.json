We first identify hotspots of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) by correlating health data with air pollutant concentrations, including sulfur dioxide ( SO2), nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2), and carbon monoxide ( CO). For these identified hotspots, both low-resolution and high-resolution satellite imagery are acquired. Our approach employs a sequential process, beginning with a Vision Transformer model that utilizes high resolution satellite imagery and a broad range of text inputs with a lower confidence threshold to initially filter the data. This is followed by the application of the Remote CLIP model, which is run twice in succession using satellite imagery paired with different text inputs to refine the detection further. This sequential tranformer chaining filter out 99% of irrelevant data from high- resolution imagery. The final step involves manual annotation on the remaining 1% of the data, ensuring high accuracy and minimizing errors. Additionally, a novel multispectral chimney index is developed for detecting chimneys in low-resolution imagery. The study introduces a unique, annotated chimney detection dataset capturing diverse chimney types, which improves detection accuracy. The results provide actionable insights for public health interventions and support regulatory measures aimed at achieving the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 3 on health and well-being. We plan to make the dataset and code publicly available following the acceptance of this paper. 1 Introduction According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 7 million people die annually from respiratory infections, with over 90% of these deaths occurring in low- and middle-income countries ( 23). This high mortality rate is primarily due to exposure to fine particulate matter and other pollutants that penetrate deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system, adversely affecting respiratory health, particularly in children ( 21). This situation represents a significant challenge to achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3, which is aimed at ensuring good health and well-being. Air pollution, a major contributor to these health issues, is caused by pollutants such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide ( 24). These pollutants often originate from industrial activities, including emissions from coal-fired power plants and other facto- ries ( 12;14;13). To address these concerns, the United Nations Environment Programme has recom- mended 25 measures to reduce air pollution ( Coalition ). Furthermore, regulations such as the National Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Environmental Quality Standards (NEQS) from the Government of Pakistan and the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) from the Government of India aim to control and reduce emissions of partic- ulate matter and carbon monoxide (NEQS, Government of Pakistan; NCAP, Government of India). In response to these critical issues, this study presents a comprehensive framework for detecting pollution sources, specifically focusing on factory and brick kiln chimneys across major South Asian cities. We start by identifying Acute Respiratory Infection (ARI) hotspots by correlating health data with high concentrations of pollutants including sulfur dioxide ( SO2), nitrogen dioxide ( NO 2), and carbon monoxide ( CO). We acquire both low-resolution and high-resolution satellite imagery for these hotspots (see Appendix for details). Our approach employs a sequential transformer chaining method to process this data. Initially, a Vision Transformer model ( 5) filters high-resolution imagery using a broad range of text inputs with a lower confidence threshold. This is followed by the Remote CLIP model ( 11), applied twice with different text inputs to further refine detection. This method filters out 99% of irrelevant data. The final step involves manual annotation of the remaining 1% of the data to ensure high accuracy (see Fig. 1). Additionally, we develop a novel multispectral chimney index for detecting chimneys in low- resolution imagery and introduce a unique, annotated dataset that captures diverse chimney types (see Fig 1). This framework provides actionable insights for public health interventions and supports regulatory measures aimed at achieving SDG 3 on health and well-being. We plan to make the dataset and code publicly available following the acceptance of this paper.
