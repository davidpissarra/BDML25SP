Furthermore, existing methods for disag- gregating water usage necessitate training data and rely on frequent data sampling to capture patterns, both of which pose challenges when scaling up and adapting to new environments. In this work, we aim to solve these challenges through a novel end-to-end approach which records data from pressure sensors and uses time- series classification by DNN models to determine room-wise water consumption in a building. This consumption data is then fed to a novel water disaggregation algorithm which can suggest a set of water-usage events, and has a flexible require- ment of training data and sampling granularity. We conduct experiments using our approach and demonstrate its potential as a promising avenue for in-depth exploration, offering valuable insights into water usage on a large scale. 1 Introduction Efficient water use is essential for long-term sustainability goals. To achieve this, it’s crucial to provide individuals and organizations with tools to optimize water usage effectively. One such approach is offering water usage insights, which informs decisions about water use and infrastructure design. Studies show that real-time feedback through smart meters and digital solutions can reduce water consumption by up to 30% [ 1,2]. Beyond reducing consumption, water usage insights can also lower energy usage in water systems, ensure fair billing, and detect leaks. While a significant percentage of water consumption can be attributed to commercial and residential buildings due to high occupant density, there is a lack of viable solutions which provide these insights on such large-scales. In this work, we present PressureML, an end-to-end and scalable approach leveraging DNN to generate real-time water usage feedback in buildings. Delivering such feedback involves two stages: 1. Recording water usage data at an appropriate level of detail in time and space, and 2. Using disaggregation techniques to identify specific fixture or appliance-level usage.

According to the UN World Water Development Report [ 3], this directly translates to reduction in energy used in treatment, transportation and waste-management of water, ultimately reducing carbon emissions. Further, it reduces the supply pressure on natural ecosystems and groundwater, thus protecting them for a sustainable future. Related work Current methods for recording total water usage primarily involve installing elec- tromagnetic or ultrasonic-pulse water meters at the main inlet of individual houses [ 4]. They are, however, (i) Difficult to use in a multi-inlet setting, (ii) Economically expensive to install for every house or area, (iii) Challenging to retrofit by cutting pipes, and (iv) Require high maintenance due to sensitive components. HydroSense[ 5] takes a different approach by calculating volume usage from pressure sensors for a set of fixtures in a house, but requires extensive labelled data and calibration ef- forts. Our approach, however, is able to get volume usage for multiple floors simultaneously, and does not require fixture-level training data and calibration. Water-usage event disaggregation research ef- forts [ 6,7,8] primarily rely on identifying and encoding distinct features and usage patterns associated with different fixtures or appliances. However, current approaches face one or more of the following challenges: (i) Focus on high-frequency input data, (ii) Requirement of environment-specific training data, and (iii) Requirement of additional sensing infrastructure. PressureML addresses the aforemen- tioned challenges by presenting a cost-effective solution which can be easily integrated in various water system configurations in residential and commercial complexes. In this work, we focus on high-rise residential apartments, where each house’s areas (such as bath- rooms and kitchens) on multiple floors (divided into zones) [ 9] are connected via dedicated pipelines supplied by a gravity-based distribution network, fed by overhead tanks (OHT). PressureML pro- poses a novel approach that shifts from collecting individual water-usage readings for all areas within each house to obtaining data for each area across all houses.
