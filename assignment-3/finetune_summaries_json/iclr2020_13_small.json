As climate change increases the likelihood of extreme weather events and reduces the pre- dictability of weather, and non-optimal soil moistures for crops may become more likely. In this work, we use a series of LSTM architectures to analyze measure- ments of soil moisture and vegetation indices derived from satellite imagery. The system learns to predict the future values of these measurements. These spatially sparse values and indices are used as input features to an interpolation method that infer spatially dense moisture maps at multiple depths for a future time point. This has the potential to provide advance warning for soil moistures that may be inhospitable to crops across an area with limited monitoring capacity. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change is one of the most pressing threats globally with the potential to cause frequent or prolonged droughts in many areas of the world (Le Hou ´erou, 1996). Infrequent or unpredictable rainfall and higher evapotranspiration due to increased temperature may lead to reduced soil mois- ture (Kingston et al., 2009). Soil moisture is critical to the growth of almost all arable crops globally impacting small subsistence farmers up to large industrial agricultural companies. Irrigation is re- quired in many regions to maintain suitable soil moisture for crops and is one of the largest fresh water usages in the world (Frenken & Gillet, 2012). Adequate soil moisture is critical for the optimal growth of crops and maximising yield. Non-optimal soil moistures can lead to crop failure which is a threat to the livelihood of farmers and can seriously endanger the robustness of the food supply chain that is vital in the modern world. Soil moisture has traditionally been monitored using ground sensors that are buried underground and can report the soil moisture in that soil column (Pagay et al., 2016). These sensors can be extremely costly both in direct equipment cost but also the labour required to embed them down to generally below one meter. These sensors then still come with the draw back that they can only report the soil moisture in that one speciﬁc location so a great number of sensors would be required to provide an accurate measure of soil moisture across a large area bringing with it an associated high cost. To avoid this, methods of interpolation have been developed that attempt to estimate the soil moisture between sensors by using algorithms based on values and distance from nearby sensors and other features at the target location (Wahba, 1990). Machine and deep learning have become recognised as a tool that can be used to help ﬁght climate change across numerous domains (Rolnick et al., 2019). 2 B ACKGROUND Soil moisture prediction into the future was previously performed through physical models. By taking an input of precipitation and temperature physical models or simple regression models could \u0003www.deepplanet.ai 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 be used to predict soil moisture using predictions of weather. These models tended to have low accuracy and predict on a low-resolution providing generalisations of soil moisture on a coarse temporal scale. With the advent of machine learning model performance greatly improved and now ﬁne scale climatic predictions such as nowcasting (Agrawal et al., 2019) which provides on the spot predictions into very near timescales are possible. But predicting further into the future in a usable way is still a difﬁcult problem. Recently deep learning has become a tool that excels in the ﬁeld of time series prediction particularly with the use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Rumelhart et al., 1986) and long-short term memory RNNs (LSTMs) (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997). LSTMs have been shown to perform well in prediction of soil moisture values into the future, with increased predictive ability leading to savings in water usage (Adeyemi et al., 2018). For predicting soil moisture not just at sensor locations machine learning frameworks have been applied on satelite imagery using radar or vegetation information (Efremova et al., 2019; Abbes et al., 2019) but these predictions are only accurate at surface level while many crop species are reliant on deeper soil moistures. Vegetation health indices such as the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Rouse et al., 1973) and the normalised difference water index (NDWI) (Gao, 1996) have been used in agriculture and geospatial ﬁelds for years. These indices also provide proxy measure of other information about the available water content in plants and soil. Being able to predict these indices in the future as a time series problem would provide information about crop health and other features in the future. Previously NDVI has been predicted using different machine learning frameworks which are able to perform adequately at the task (Das & Ghosh, 2016; Nay et al., 2018; Stas et al., 2016).
