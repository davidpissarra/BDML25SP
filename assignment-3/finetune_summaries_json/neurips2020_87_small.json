However, the root of the problem is more complex, with the potential beneﬁts of these approaches depending on numerous factors including a ﬁeld’s soil type(s), topography, and management history. Instead of using computer vision approaches to simply classify a ﬁeld as till vs. no-till, we instead seek to identify the degree of residue coverage across a ﬁeld through a probabilistic deep learning segmentation approach to enable more accurate analysis of carbon holding potential and realization. This approach will not only provide more precise insights into currently implemented practices, but also enable a more accurate identiﬁcation process of ﬁelds with the greatest po- tential for adopting new practices to signiﬁcantly impact carbon sequestration in agriculture. 1 Residues, Tillage Practices, and Nutrient Management Carbon sequestration is one of the primary topics raised in discussions around agriculture and climate change. Soils have the capacity to be enormous carbon sources or sinks with farm management prac- tices signiﬁcantly impacting how much carbon is held in the soil ( 8). Past agricultural management decisions in the US have depleted global soil organic carbon (SOC) by as much as 72:8\u000613:2billion US tn (12). US cropland which covers roughly 157M hais estimated to have the capacity to sequester 0:3\u00000:5Mg haof carbon/year for a total potential of 45\u000098Tgcarbon/year ( 2;11). Altering past practices to bring carbon out of the atmosphere and into the soil helps to both mitigate greenhouse gasses, reduce negative agricultural contributions to the environmental, and improves soil health and water holding capacity (15; 2; 17). Many initiatives around carbon sequestration for cropland are heavily focused around tillage prac- tices ( 3). Residues consist of crop biomass such as dried leaves and stalks leftover from harvest; these residues contain key nutrients that the plants had absorbed during the season. By reincorporating these residues back into the soil, usually via tilling, farmers are able to recycle those nutrients: as residues decompose, nutrients re-enter the soil, fueling the next year’s crops. In contrast, “no-till” and alternative tillage practices limit the amount of tillage conducted. Maintaining surface residues has numerous beneﬁts including increasing SOC and water capacity, increasing porosity, preventing \u0003corresponding author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Figure 1: (Top Left) Aerial image of a ﬁeld with highly variable residue density. Such variability is due to a combination of management practices, soil composition, and topography (Bottom Left). At ground-level (Right), we see these same factors as well as crop-type and time-since-tillage impact the ﬁeld’s appearance. erosion, and enhancing soil stability, especially when used in combination with cover crops ( 17). Switching to no-till additionally requires one-less step in the farming life-cycle, saving labor time as well as reducing fuel usage. However, residues can cause keep nutrients tied up in unusable forms, harbor pest and diseases, and inhibit emergence, leading to signiﬁcant loss of yield if not adequately managed (7). As a result, adoption of no-till and reduced-tillage practices vary widely across regions and crops, with only \u001820% of farmland using no-till practices continuously ( 17;4). While many associate no-till and cover cropping as the key, beneﬁcial approaches in carbon sequestration and erosion prevision, the impact of various tillage practices is far more complicated; the amount of carbon which can be sequestered with these practices can vary widely based on soil composition, moisture-levels, topography, and other management decisions ( 16;2). The economic beneﬁt of these practices must be established in an accurate, personalized manner for each farm in order to promote widespread trust and adoption. The visual impact of these management choices manifest themselves in complex ways across the ﬁeld as seen in Figure 1. Capturing and understanding all of these contributing factors is critical for accurately assessing the impact of tillage practices on a particular farm as well as encouraging broad adoption of these management practices; a simple classiﬁcation of till/no-till is not enough.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nStrategies in agriculture aim to improve carbon sequestration, but the root of the problem is complex, with benefits depending on various factors such as soil type, topography, and management history. Instead of classifying fields as till or no-till using computer vision, we propose a probabilistic deep learning segmentation approach to identify the degree of residue coverage across a field. This approach enables more accurate analysis of carbon-holding potential and realization, providing precise insights into current practices and identifying fields with the greatest potential for adopting new practices to significantly impact carbon sequestration in agriculture.\n\nResidues, Tillage Practices, and Nutrient Management\n\nCarbon sequestration is a primary topic in discussions around agriculture and climate change. Soils have the capacity to be enormous carbon sources or sinks, with farm management practices significantly impacting how much carbon is held in the soil. Past agricultural management decisions in the US have depleted global soil organic carbon (SOC) by as much as 72.8 billion tons. US cropland, covering approximately 157 million hectares, is estimated to have the capacity to sequester 0.3-0.5 million metric tons of carbon per hectare per year, totaling 45.98 teragrams of carbon per year. Altering past practices to bring carbon out of the atmosphere and into the soil helps mitigate greenhouse gases, reduce negative agricultural contributions to the environment, and improve soil health and water-holding capacity.\n\nMany initiatives around carbon sequestration for cropland focus on tillage practices. Residues consist of crop biomass, such as dried leaves and stalks leftover from harvest, which contain key nutrients absorbed by the plants during the season. By reincorporating these residues back into the soil, usually via tilling, farmers can recycle those nutrients as residues decompose, providing nutrients for the next year's crops. In contrast, \"no-till\" and alternative tillage practices limit the amount of tillage conducted. Maintaining surface residues has numerous benefits, including increasing soil organic carbon and water capacity, increasing porosity, preventing erosion, and enhancing soil stability, especially when used in combination with cover crops.\n\nSwitching to no-till requires one less step in the farming life cycle, saving labor time and reducing fuel usage. However, residues can cause nutrients to be tied up in unusable forms, harbor pests and diseases, and inhibit emergence, leading to significant yield loss if not adequately managed. As a result, adoption of no-till and reduced-tillage practices varies widely across regions and crops, with only 20% of farmland using no-till practices continuously.\n\nWhile many associate no-till and cover cropping as key beneficial approaches in carbon sequestration and erosion prevention, the impact of various tillage practices is far more complicated. The amount of carbon that can be sequestered with these practices can vary widely based on soil composition, moisture levels, topography, and other management decisions.

Capturing and understanding all contributing factors is critical for accurately assessing the impact of tillage practices on a particular farm and encouraging broad adoption of these management practices. A simple classification of till/no-till is not enough. Therefore, we segment the field into different levels of residue coverage to provide a fine-grained map of this biomass layer. This information can be combined with soil, hydrological, and other models to more accurately determine the opportunity for carbon sequestration on a given farm parcel and the impact of tillage practices to capitalize on those storage capacities.\n\nIdentifying the density of residue further helps farmers more effectively manage residues across their field and enables novel precision tillage practices. As opposed to treating tillage as a binary management choice, our approach provides a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between tillage practices, soil, and climate."
