We pr esent  a pipeline  that utilizes  LiDAR  data as ground -truth   and then trains a multi -task machine  learning  model  to generate  reliable  estimates   of tree cover  and canopy  height  in urban  areas  using  multi -source  multi -spectral   satellite  imagery  for the case study  of Chicago.   1 Introduction  1  Major American cities such as New York, Los Angeles, Boston, and Chicago have set fo rth tree 2  planting initiatives as part of larger efforts to mitigate climate change, improve quality of life, and 3  promote environmental equity. One of the primary issue s policymakers face when deciding how to 4  allocate tree planting resources is a lack of hi gh quality, up -to-date datasets about the urban canopy. 5  This paper  proposes a novel pipeline for generating estimates of two urban canopy measures, tree 6  cover and canopy height,  in Chicago  for timepoints when high -quality data is unavailable. Previous 7  research has utilized machine learning ( ML) approaches  to predict tree canopy  [3] but  have yet  to 8  leverage th ese technique s to create detailed estimates of urban tree cover and canopy height a s 9  demonstrated in this project.  10  2 Data on the Urban Canopy  11  Three main techniques have been  previously developed to generate estimates of urban canopies. 12  Surveying techniques  have been used, for example, by Morton Arboretum in Chicago to produce a 13  tree census. This tree census counted the number of trees in 268 selected plots, and then extrapolated 14  those numbers to the entire city, estimating that Chicago contains about 3,997,000 trees  [4]. As it 15  would be impossible for humans to physically  count the num ber of trees in an area as large as 16  Chicago, the exact number of trees remains  unknown and can only be estimated.  17  An alternative to surveying techniques is airborne Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR). LiDAR 18  utilizes light beams to create a cloud of millio ns of points  that can be  accurate within a few 19  centimeters [5].  Numerous algorithms exist for detecting and measuring trees from LiDAR point 20  clouds  that can be used to generate three -dimensional  representations  of the urban canopy. Despite 21  this, LiDAR can only capture  a point in time, and the collection of LiDAR data, especially over 22  large areas, is quite expensive, so researchers are often relegated to using outdated data.  23  To get around a lack of consistent data collection, ML techniques can be used to ge nerate accurate, 24  up-to-date estimates of urban canopies.  Weinstein et al.  [6] used a convolutional neural network to 25  identify individual trees through image segmentation in a California forest using RGB (red, green, 26  and blue) images. In addition to RGB ima ges, multi -spectral (MS) imagery  has been shown to aid 27  in predictive models. Wang Li et al.  [3] successfully  used a ML model to predict forest canopy height 28  from MS imagery in a mountainous region of China. Furthermore, p revious research has tried  to 29  predict relative building and vegetation height and semantic segmentation masks simultaneously  30  [7,8]. Despite these efforts,  studies have yet to estimate tree cover and canopy height in an urban 31  setting using MS satellite images.  32      2 This paper focuses on  multiple measures of the urban canopy, tree cover and canopy height, because 33  alone, neither horizontal nor vertical measures of the urban canopy capture the whole effect trees 34  have on the environment. In general, larger trees tend to have a greater enviro nmental effect than 35  smaller trees, with numerous smaller trees often unable to match the effects of a single large tree [9, 36  10]. By accounting for both a horizontal and vertical measure, a more accurate assessment of the 37  urban canopy’s impact on climate in dicators  can eventually  be quantified.  38  3 Estimating Tree Cover and Canopy Height  39  Chicago LiDAR point cloud data from 2017 was retrieved from the Illinois Geospatial Data 40  Clearinghouse [11]. Additional MS satellite imagery was used from the National Agriculture 41  Imagery Program (NAIP) and the Sentinel -2 satellite program. Four -band NAIP RBG and NIR data  42  at 1-m resolution was collected from the US Geological Survey’s earth explorer for 2017 and 2019\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
