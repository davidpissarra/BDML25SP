We develop deep auto-regressive models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory networks (LSTM) that are globally trained across many solar sites on the raw spatio-temporal data from GOES-R satellites. This self-supervised model provides estimates of future solar irradiance that can be fed directly to a regression model trained on smaller site-speciﬁc solar data to provide near-term solar PV forecasts at the site. The regression implicitly models site- speciﬁc characteristics, such as capacity, panel tilt, orientation, etc, while the self-supervised CNN- LSTM implicitly captures global atmospheric pat- terns affecting a site’s solar irradiation. Results across 25 solar sites show the utility of such self- supervised modeling by providing accurate near- term forecast with errors close to that of a model using current ground-truth observations. 1.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at ICML 2021.projects that the share of renewable sources, such as wind and solar, in the electricity generation mix will double to al- most 42% by 2050, and solar generation is poised to account for almost 80% of this increase (EIA, 2021). A large portion of solar energy comes from small-scale rooftop residential solar installations, including private homes and businesses. This in turn implies that consumers, instead of buying elec- tricity from the grid, are now generating their own energy as well as selling it back to the grid. All of this decentralized and intermittent energy generation by millions of individual users fundamentally alters the grid’s supply and demand balance. The underlying problem is the uncertainty associ- ated with solar and that solar has a potentially inﬁnite ramp rate – its output can rise and fall instantaneously. In contrast, the ramp rate for conventional thermal generators is ﬁnite – it takes time to ramp up generation. Since the grid must balance electricity’s supply and demand at all times, any rise or drop in solar generation must be compensated by using conventional generators. To do so, utilities often keep these generators on “spinning reserve”, such that they are active but not connected. Such spinning reserves increases energy’s cost and carbon emissions. Accurate near-term solar forecasts can reduce the need for such spinning reserves by enabling utilities to better plan when to activate generators. Thus, such near-term forecasts can help grid operators plan and balance electricity genera- tion and consumption (Wu et al., 2015; Haupt et al., 2019). Moreover, it can help in energy market optimization (Kaur et al., 2016), help in planning of residential power and grid defection (Bansal & Irwin, 2019), and lower the risks asso- ciated with using intermittently available solar power (Quan et al., 2015). While some utility-scale solar sites may invest in developing their own custom models and forecasts, solar is becoming highly distributed with millions of small sites, which motivates a more automated approach. Solar generation is affected by a number of factors, includ- ing a solar site’s physical characteristics as well as atmo- spheric conditions. While physical characteristics, such as solar module area, tilt, orientation, etc., have well-known physical models (Chen & Irwin, 2017), modeling and fore- casting the impact of passing clouds and other atmospheric phenomenon are more difﬁcult and often the largest sourcesSelf-Supervised Learning on Multispectral Satellite Data for Near-Term Solar Forecasting of error (Yang et al., 2012; Sanders et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2018; Bansal & Irwin, 2020a; Siddiqui et al., 2019). While, ground-level weather monitoring stations include weather sensors to facilitate such forecasts, they can be sparsely located. Thus, a more accessible approach is to develop ma- chine learning (ML) models from multispectral satellite data that can remotely and uniformly sense large portions of the globe. This approach is especially promising for near-term solar forecasting.
