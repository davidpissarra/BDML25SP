We present here a complete framework to identify CH 4 plumes using images from the PRISMA satellite mission and a deep learning model able to detect plumes over large areas. To compensate for the relative scarcity of PRISMA images, we trained our model by transposing high resolution plumes from Sentinel-2 to PRISMA. Our methodology thus avoids computationally expensive synthetic plume generation from Large Eddy Simulations by generating a broad and realistic training database, and paves the way for large-scale detection of methane plumes using future hyperspectral sensors (EnMAP, EMIT, CarbonMapper). 1 Introduction Since 2019, the new generation of hyperspectral satellites (PRISMA, EnMAP,...) collects an unprecedented amount of atmospheric data enabling the retrieval of methane (CH 4) concentrations over the globe at high spatial resolutions (around 30m per pixel). These satellite missions offer high resolution and broad spectral coverage, in particular in the shortwave infrared (1 to 2.5 µm) where methane absorption is significant. These specifications enable lower detection thresholds compared to multispectral satellites for the identification and attribution of methane emissions from human activities (large releases from point sources), thus offering a path to reduce CH 4emissions as pledged by nations engaged in climate mitigation agreements [1]. The satellite PRISMA1was launched in 2019 with forthcoming satellite missions like EnMAP offering similar coverage and performances. We propose here a complete processing pipeline for methane plumes identification on images from PRISMA, allowing efficient large-scale monitoring of these emissions. We present a novel automatic detection procedure that benefits from existing datasets 1Project carried out using PRISMA Products, ©of the Italian Space Agency (ASI), delivered under an ASI Licence to Use Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.of CH 4images, collected by the previous generation of satellites (e.g. Sentinel). This approach can combine multiple spaceborne CH 4imagers and enables the rapid development of a functional processing chain applicable to any future satellite instruments. 2 Methods 2.1 Spectral Recalibration PRISMA is a satellite orbiting the Earth in a near polar, sun-synchronous trajectory [ 2]. It carries a hyperspectral pushbroom sensor, made up of a line of 1,000 hyperspectral individual sensors scanning the ground. A spectral calibration of the 1,000 hyperspectral sensors is provided with the datacubes. However, the nominal parameters used for the spectral calibration are not perfectly accurate since they were determined on ground, while heat perturbations or vibrations may alter the correctness of these parameters. Hence it is necessary to apply spectral recalibration to each PRISMA scene before further processing. This preprocessing step is done by generating a theoretical radiance spectrum using a radiative transfer simulation modeling the emission of radiation by the Sun, its interactions with the Earth’s atmosphere and reflection on the ground before being sent back towards the satellite’s sensors. This is the so-called top-of-atmosphere radiance, which is eventually convolved with the sensors’ parameters to get the simulated at-sensor radiance. The recalibration is then done by minimizing a distance criterion between the theoretical spectrum and the averaged observed spectrum for each sensor. 2.2 Methane Retrieval We use the matched filter algorithm to derive the map of methane concentrations from raw radiance data from PRISMA. This algorithm allows for supervised target detection in signal processing and has been frequently used to produce gas concentrations retrieval [ 3,4,5]. In our study, we use the same formulation as described in [3]. For a target signal t∈Rdretrieved from an observed signal x∈Rdof mean µand covariance Σ, the matched filter operator writes α(x) =(x−µ)TΣ−1t tTΣ−1t.
