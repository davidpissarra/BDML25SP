Our input data includes past deforestation development, slope information, land use, and other terrain- and soil-specific covariates. Testing predictions 1-year ahead, we find that our models only achieve low levels of predictability. For pixel-wise classification at a 30 m resolution, our models achieve an F1 score of 0.263. Only when substantially simplifying the task to predicting if any level of deforestation occurs within a 1.5 km squared tile, the model results improve to a moderate performance (F1: 0.608). We conclude that, based on our input data, deforestation cannot be predicted accurately enough to justify the ex-ante issuance of carbon credits for forest conservation projects. As main challenges, there is the extreme class imbalance between pixels that are deforested (minority) and not deforested (majority) as well as the omittance of social, political, and economic drivers of deforestation. 1 Introduction Deforestation has a substantial impact on climate change. In the Brazilian Amazonian Biome alone, 21.3 M ha of rainforest were cut down in the years from 2000 to 2020 (Souza et al., 2020) making the rainforest a net-carbon emitter (Gatti et al., 2021). Forest conservation projects help to mitigate deforestation by protecting endangered sites. Often they are financed via voluntary carbon markets by issuing carbon offset certificates upfront. This requires project developers to calculate future emissions reductions achieved by the project by estimating the deforestation risk as a baseline scenario. However, this financing structure is heavily debated, as the deforestation risk is estimated through simplistic methods. Retrospective analyses (West et al., 2020, 2023; Guizar-Couti√±o et al., 2022) show that project developers substantially overstated the actual risk of deforestation, thereby achieving only a fraction of the claimed emissions reductions. Here, we investigate to which extent it is possible to accurately predict the risk of deforestation in advance in order to make well-founded claims about future emissions reductions. We use DL techniques to forecast the location of deforestation in the Amazonian Rainforest. Our analysis focuses on two tasks: 1) Pixel-wise classification : For each forest pixel in a given tile (of size 1.5 km), predict if it will be deforested or not in the next year. 2) Tile-wise classification : Given a tile, predict if any deforestation will take place in the next year. The code for our analyses is publicly available viahttps://github.com/TimEngelmann/future-deforestation. Our results have important Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.implications for deforestation projects in the voluntary carbon markets and question the current practice of issuing carbon credits ex-ante. 2 Related work Only a few studies have tried to forecast deforestation with different approaches and mixed results. Takahata et al. (2022) uses a Bayesian model to derive dynamic baseline scenarios of deforestation for entire project sites of approximately 30T ha. They account for four different covariates: (1) distance to recent deforestation, (2) distance to urban centers/capitals, (3) distance to roads/highways, and (4) slope/elevation information. However, their ex-ante predictions are merely indicative and could vary significantly within their proposed 90% confidence interval. Ball et al. (2022) proposes a different approach by forecasting how deforestation will spread on pixel-level. In particular, they predict for each pixel of 30 m resolution if it will be deforested in the subsequent year using satellite data and a convolutional deep-learning model adapted from Li et al. (2017). As a result, they report F1 scores up to 0.715. As we describe in Section 3.1 and 4, we believe that their data splitting and down-sampling approach has led to overconfident test performance results. 3 Methods 3.1 Data and preprocessing Our analysis is based on the MAPBIOMAS Brasil dataset (Souza et al., 2020; West et al., 2020; Takahata et al., 2022). Specifically, we make use of the yearly deforestation, land use, and pasture quality layers. Additionally, we add slope information from the FABDEM dataset (Hawker et al., 2022; Takahata et al., 2022). We use a resolution of 30 m which is the most granular available resolution. Furthermore, we work in the coordinate system EPSG:6933 and focus on the region of the Brazilian Amazon biome (IBGE, 2019). Appendix A.1 provides further details regarding the choice of data and pixel resolution. Through further preprocessing, we generate the following eight input layers: (1) Distance to the closest pixel\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Our input data includes past deforestation patterns, slope information, land use, and other terrain- and soil-specific factors. We tested our models for predicting deforestation one year ahead and found that they achieved only low levels of accuracy. For pixel-wise classification at a 30-meter resolution, our models achieved an F1 score of 0.263. However, when simplifying the task to predicting whether any deforestation occurs within a 1.5-kilometer square tile, the model results improved to a moderate level of performance (F1: 0.608).
