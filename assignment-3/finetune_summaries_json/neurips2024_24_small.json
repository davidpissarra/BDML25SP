These include incorrect representation of intermittency and extreme values (critical for hydrology applications), Gibbs phenomenon upon regridding, and lack of fine scales details. To address these challenges, a common approach is to transform the precipitation variable nonlinearly into one that is more malleable. In this work, we explore how deep learning can be used to generate a smooth, spatio-temporally continuous variable as a proxy for simulation of precip- itation data. We develop a normally distributed field called pseudo-precipitation (PP) as an alternative for simulating precipitation. The practical applicability of this variable is investigated by applying it for downscaling precipitation from 1◦ (∼100 km) to 0.25◦(∼25 km). 1 Introduction Precipitation is a key driver of the Earth’s hydrological cycle, making its accurate modeling crucial for studying atmospheric processes. Accurate estimation of precipitation is vital for various human activities, such as transportation and agriculture. Unlike smoother meteorological variables such as temperature, water vapor, and wind speed, precipitation data is sparse and exhibits significant spatial variability. Despite major advancements in numerical weather prediction (NWP) and global circulation models (GCMs), these models still face challenges in accurately predicting extreme precipitation events, like heavy rainfall, due to limitations in resolution and parameterization. These models are further constrained by high computational demands of simulating global climate. Precipitation data presents several inherent complexities that make its post processing particularly challenging. Precipitation has high spatio-temporal variability, resulting in vast regions with zero values interspersed with sporadic positive values that can increase exponentially in magnitude [ 21]. The low frequency of extreme precipitation events adds to the complexity [ 18,17]. Moreover, both precipitation and the various multi-scale factors contributing to its formation display non-normal and nonlinear behaviors. These challenges are particularly evident in downstream applications such as statistical post- processing [ 25], downscaling [ 11,8,16], nowcasting [ 18], and forecasting [ 10,15]. Various research groups have utilized statistical methods to address the complexities of precipitation data, especially Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.in bias correction [ 23,9,22]. The statistical post-processing of simulated precipitation from NWP models lack proper consideration of a number of moisture-related properties of non-precipitating members of the ensemble that likely have discriminating information on the calibration forecasts. This issue is more pronounced when the ensemble forecast is dry-biased, making the statistical adjustment process more complicated. To address this issue, Yuan et al. [24] proposed a statistically continuous variable called pseudo-precipitation obtained after blending precipitation and integrated vapour deficit (IVD) together. To achieve a consistent representation for precipitation while preserving its key characteristics, we propose using machine learning for generating a pseudo-precipitation field. For transforming total precipitation (TP) into a spatiotemporally continuous field, we use vertically integrated moisture divergence (VIMD) [ 2]. VIMD contains relevant information pertaining to decrease (divergence) or increase (convergence) of moisture within a vertical column of air. Unlike IVD, VIMD can take both negative and postive values and its spatial correlation structure is similar to TP. This can potentially enable more effective blending, specifically at point of discontinuity through deep learning techniques, as detailed in Section 2. Further, we perform the blending of our pseudo-precipitation field targeted towards a symmetric Gaussian distribution. The smoother Gaussian blending makes precipitation data more manageable for analysis, enhancing the coherence and accuracy of post-processing models. Additionally, it offers improved physical consistency by representing the processes driving precipita- tion patterns and facilitate the integration of precipitation with other climate variables. To assess the practical applicability of pseudo-precipitation, we evaluate its efficacy for the downscaling task using generative deep learning [14, 6]. 2 Methods Pseudo-precipitation (PP) We define PP as a smooth, Gaussian field generated by blending TP and VIMD, inspired by the work of Yuan et al. In [24], IVD was used to generate the PP field. IVD represents the difference between actual and saturation specific humidity, integrated throughout the troposphere. IVD measures dryness of the atmospheric column and hence is always negative. The authors defined PP as being equal to precipitation when precipitation is positive while the non-positive values are replaced by IVD after suitable transformation to ensure continuity of the blended field. In this work, we use VIMD as a replacement for IVD.
