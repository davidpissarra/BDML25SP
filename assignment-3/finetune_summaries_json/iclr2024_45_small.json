This work leverages generative diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric data. It employs a cascaded approach that incorporates three main tasks: forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling. The training dataset includes 51 cyclones from six major tropical cyclone basins from January 2019 - March 2023. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout, with excellent Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak-Signal-To-Noise Ratio (PSNR) values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. The 36-hour forecasts can be produced in as little as 30 mins on a single Nvidia A30/RTX 2080 Ti. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of Al methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs in weather forecasting, such as tropical cyclone forecasting, while remaining computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations.

Rising global temperatures and changing atmospheric circulation patterns are significant drivers of these extreme events [ 2], posing challenges for water resource management, infrastructure planning, and disaster risk reduction [ 3]. Advanced machine learning (ML) techniques have emerged as a promising solution for predicting and understanding extreme rainfall behaviour under climate change [ 4]. These algorithms can analyse large datasets, capture complex spatio-temporal relationships, and make precise predictions without the need for explicit programming. Leveraging modern computing systems like GPUs and distributed architectures, ML offers a revolutionary approach to meteorological modelling, replacing traditional supercomputer- based simulations [5]. In recent times, diffusion models [ 6] have garnered substantial attention across various domains, in- cluding weather forecasting, climate modelling, and image processing. Leinonen et al. [ 7] introduced a latent diffusion model (LDM) for precipitation nowcasting, surpassing traditional methods and deep generative models in accuracy and uncertainty quantification. Bassetti et al. [ 8] demonstrated the efficiency of diffusion models, particularly DiffESM, in emulating Earth System Models (ESMs) for analyzing extreme weather events while demanding fewer computational resources. Hatanaka et 1Published as a workshop paper at \"Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning\", ICLR 2024 al. [9] improved uncertainty modelling in weather and climate forecasts using score-based diffusion models, benefiting high-dimensional solar irradiance predictions. Addison et al. [ 10] showcased diffusion models’ ability to generate realistic high-resolution rainfall samples from low-resolution simulations for flood modelling. This study draws inspiration from previous works in atmospheric modelling that have utilised diffusion models. It explores a novel approach by employing multiple diffusion models organized in a cascading manner to predict tropical cyclones (TC), which are a critical example of extreme rainfall events that have been intensified by climate change. In particular, this research contributes to the existing literature on AI-based atmospheric modelling in the following ways: 1.A novel adaptation of a framework utilising diffusion models (often used in natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as text-to-image generation, image-to-image transformation, etc.) in forecasting TCs using publicly available atmospheric reanalysis data such as ERA5 [11] [12] and IR 10.8µm satellite data. 2.Experimental demonstration of highly effective model predictive ability having single-step SSIM and PSNR above 0.5 and 20 dB respectively, and strong accuracy with rollout around 36 hours. 3.Model design optimised on single GPUs (eg.
