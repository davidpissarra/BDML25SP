Speciﬁcally, emissions from light-duty vehicles account for more than half of the total emissions in the trans- portation sector (AEO, 2018). Several countries have been adopting an increasing number of incentives to decarbonize the light-duty vehicle sector through zero-emission vehicles (ZEV). This has been reﬂected in the recent uptake of bat- tery electric vehicle (BEV) ﬂeet all over the world (Lutsey, 2015). However, there are still concerns among consumers about purchasing a BEV regarding range limitation, long charging times and charger congestion (Wahlman, 2013). To further increase the total market penetration of ZEVs in the light-duty ﬂeet, a portfolio approach of technological diversity is needed that addresses the variety of concerns expressed by the consumers. In California and Japan, hy- drogen fuel cell vehicles (FCV) were introduced in recent years and are being increasingly adopted alongside BEVs. There are currently over 5,800 FCVs in California (CAFCP, 2019a), and it is estimated that about 40,000 FCVs will be on the Californian roads by 2022 (ARB, 2018). FCVs have a longer driving range, signiﬁcantly shorter refueling time 1Palo Alto Research Center, Palo Alto, California, USA. Corre- spondence to: Kalai Ramea <kramea@parc.com >.

Thus, they can play an important role in expanding the light-duty vehicle ZEV market as they have the potential to complement and alleviate some of the concerns raised about the BEVs. One of the biggest barriers to FCV adoption is the reliability and availability of hydrogen fueling stations. Unlike BEVs, which have multiple modes of charging (home, work, pub- lic chargers), FCVs solely rely on access to public fueling infrastructure. The reputation of an unreliable station may discourage consumers from adopting the technology (Kel- ley, 2018). Therefore, for signiﬁcant market acceptance of FCVs, policymakers should not only consider a good net- work of hydrogen refueling stations but also have a metric to assess their performance on a real-time basis. Existing Literature: In the past, researchers have devel- oped various designs of what constitutes an optimal network of hydrogen stations in the pre-planning stage (Ogden & Nicholas, 2011; Stephens-Romero et al., 2010). Several modeling approaches have been explored to understand the spread and quantity of hydrogen refueling station designs (Lim & Kuby, 2010; Nicholas & Ogden, 2007; Honma & Kurita, 2008; Bhatti et al., 2015; Kang & Recker, 2015). However, there has been little focus on assessing and moni- toring the performance of existing stations. Although Na- tional Renewable Energy Laboratory has published speciﬁc data products on hydrogen station infrastructure (NREL, 2019), most of this data explains the technical details of the hydrogen fuel delivery and the adoption of fuel at the regional level on the supply side. In this paper, we demonstrate an unsupervised temporal clustering approach on the hourly utilization data that was collected as a part of this project. To better understand the reasons behind the clustered categories, we conducted a survey of 100 FCV drivers in California. This approach identiﬁes the stations that are performing within the healthy range, and those that are over-stressed and intervention is needed. We are publicly releasing the hourly station capac- ity dataset we collected for this research project1.
