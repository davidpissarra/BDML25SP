However, current rainforest inventories are too inaccurate, because they are often based on a few expensive ground-based samples and/or low-resolution satellite imagery. LiDAR-based solutions, used in US forests, are accurate, but cost-prohibitive, and hardly-accessible in the Amazon rainforest. We propose accurate and cheap forest inventory analyses through Deep Learning-based processing of drone imagery. The more transparent estimation of stored carbon will create higher transparency towards clients and thereby increase trust and investment into forest preservation projects. I. T HEPROBLEM Deforestation and forest degradation are responsible for \u001815% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as burning forest releases stored carbon into the air [1]–[3]. Stopping deforesta- tion and forest degradation and supporting sustainable forestry hence mitigates climate change and also preserves biodiversity, prevents ﬂooding, controls soil erosion, reduces river siltation, and offers a workplace for the local population [1]. Despite the paramount importance of reforestation and preservation efforts, they are far from sufﬁcient, mostly because of a lack of ﬁnancing [1], [4]. This ﬁnancial gap is created by a severe lack of trust into reforestation and preservation projects as they are not transparent in their CO2 impact to client companies that want to offset carbon emissions [4], [5]. Forest inventories are common practice in forestry, account for25% of the expenses of reforestation and estimate stored carbon [4]. Apart from carbon estimation, forest inventories are also created to identify illegal logging, control pests and diseases, estimate the opportunity cost of deforestation, manage wildﬁre hazards, and achieve sustainable forestry. Classical forest inventories are created through manually counting and classifying trees in a \u00187\u000015m radius every 0:09\u00001km [4]. The sparse samples are interpolated, recently with the help of satellite imagery, to create an inventory for the whole forest. Ground-based sampling, however, is prohibitively expensive ( \u0018300USD/ha), and time-intensive (2\u00007days/ 20ha) in large-scale rainforests, due to dense vegetation, a large team of experts, and scarcity of roads [4]. Purely satellite-based approaches mostly use publicly Fig. 1: Medium-resolution drone imagery, collected during pilot ﬂights near San Ram ´on, Per ´u. available RGB-NIR satellite imagery, or radar. As the low- resolution (RGB max. 30cm/px, radar\u0018250m/px) does not sufﬁce to accurately determine the tree count, species, or height, most satellite-based approaches only measure area covered by forest which leads to rough estimates of carbon sequestering potential with high uncertainties [4], [6]. LiDAR- based approaches, used in US forests, are very accurate, but hardly-accessible and cost-prohibitive for low budget reforestation and preservation projects, because of the expense of the sensor and the bigger carrying drone, or plane [4], [7]. II. T HESOLUTION /INNOVATION Our goal is to increase investment into reforestation and preservation projects to combat climate change by providing an accurate, cheap, and transparent carbon storage analysis. The analysis is supplied to reforestation and preservation projects that, with the analysis, have sufﬁcient trust to convince their client companies to higher investments. A. Technical Solution The proposed forest inventory assessment consists of an on-site data collection and an off-site processing part. During the data collection with the local partner, a low-cost quadrotor (DJI Phantom 4 Pro, 1:5kUSD) and ﬁve batteries have to been used to map 100ha in\u00185hrs with one operator ( \u001810USD/ha) for Fig. 2. DroneDeploy was used to plan the ﬂight and mosaic the images. The next iteration will be an off-the-shelf, low-cost vertical take off and landing (VTOL) ﬁxed-wing drone to cover up to 250ha in one 60min ﬂight and launch in dense forests. The drone will be equipped with a gimbal, 4k GoPro RGB camera, and a Sentera NDVI-IR camera.Fig. 2: Collected map from pilot ﬂights with the National Geograph- ics Institute of Peru near San Ram ´on.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nProjects can conduct accurate forest inventories to estimate biomass and stored carbon. However, current rainforest inventories are inaccurate due to limited ground-based samples and low-resolution satellite imagery. LiDAR-based solutions are accurate but expensive and inaccessible in the Amazon rainforest. We propose using Deep Learning-based processing of drone imagery for accurate and affordable forest inventory analysis. This will increase transparency and trust in forest preservation projects, leading to higher investment.\n\nI. The Problem\n\nDeforestation and forest degradation account for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions, as burning forests releases stored carbon into the air. Stopping deforestation and forest degradation mitigates climate change, preserves biodiversity, prevents flooding, controls soil erosion, and provides a workplace for local populations. Despite the importance of reforestation and preservation efforts, they are insufficient due to a lack of financing, primarily because of a lack of trust in reforestation and preservation projects. This lack of trust is caused by a lack of transparency in the CO2 impact of these projects for client companies that want to offset carbon emissions.\n\nForest inventories are a common practice in forestry, accounting for 25% of reforestation expenses and estimating stored carbon. Apart from carbon estimation, forest inventories also identify illegal logging, control pests and diseases, estimate the opportunity cost of deforestation, manage wildfire hazards, and achieve sustainable forestry. Classical forest inventories involve manually counting and classifying trees within a 7-15m radius every 0.09-1km. However, this method is expensive (approximately $300/ha) and time-intensive (2-7 days/20ha) in large-scale rainforests due to dense vegetation, a large team of experts, and limited road access.\n\nSatellite-based approaches use publicly available RGB-NIR satellite imagery or radar, but low-resolution imagery (up to 30cm/px for RGB and 250m/px for radar) is insufficient for accurately determining tree count, species, or height. As a result, most satellite-based approaches only measure the area covered by forest, leading to rough estimates of carbon sequestration potential with high uncertainties.\n\nLiDAR-based approaches, used in US forests, are accurate but inaccessible and expensive for low-budget reforestation and preservation projects.\n\nII. The Solution/Innovation\n\nOur goal is to increase investment in reforestation and preservation projects by providing an accurate, cheap, and transparent carbon storage analysis. This analysis will be supplied to reforestation and preservation projects, enabling them to convince client companies to invest more.\n\nA. Technical Solution\n\nThe proposed forest inventory assessment consists of on-site data collection and off-site processing. During data collection, a low-cost quadrotor (DJI Phantom 4 Pro, approximately $1.5k) and five batteries are used to map 100ha in 5 hours with one operator (approximately $10/ha). The next iteration will use an off-the-shelf, low-cost vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) fixed-wing drone to cover up to 250ha in one 60-minute flight and launch in dense forests. The drone will be equipped with a gimbal, 4k GoPro RGB camera, and a Sentera NDVI-IR camera.\n\nDeep Learning algorithms will be used to extract crown diameter, species, and count of emergent and canopy trees. A pixel-wise segmentation algorithm based on DeepLabv3+ and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture will classify tree species at each pixel of the collected RGB-NIR imagery and extract crown diameter and tree count."
