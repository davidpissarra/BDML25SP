In this short paper, we evaluate the proposed architecture for simulating global sea surface tem- peratures and compare the results with the stan- dard DMD and seasonal forecasts produced by the state-of-the-art dynamical model, CFSv2. 1. Introduction In recent years there has been signiﬁcant effort by major dynamical modeling groups to perform decadal (1-10 year) forecasts (e.g., Yeager et al. (2018) and Vecchi (2015)). These forecasts can bridge the gap from seasonal forecasts (Kirtman et al., 2014) to multidecadal predictions (Eyring et al., 2016) and are speciﬁcally designed to forecast ﬂuctu- ations through knowledge of the current climate state and multi-year ocean variability. Although skill is limited by the predictability of phenomena like the El Ni ˜noSouthern Oscillation (ENSO), decadal forecasts can provide critical and actionable information on regional climate trends. Another strategy for decadal predictions that has received attention uses data to ﬁt a statistical model. A particular example of such an approach is found in (Newman, 2013), in which the Linear Inverse Model, also known as Dynamic 1IBM Research2IBM Global Business Services.

Copyright 2021 by the author(s).Mode Decomposition (DMD), is applied to make decadal forecasts. DMD has been used to successfully model cli- matic phenomena such as tropical diabatic heating and sea surface temperatures (SSTs; Huddart et al. (2017)). In its most basic form, DMD seeks to ﬁt a linear dynamical sys- tem of the form: d dtx=Ax (1) which has an exact solution given by: x(t0+t) =eAtx(t0) (2) The dynamics are characterized by the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of A, typically the leading eigen- value/eigenvector pairs. A common strategy in modeling environmental variables with DMD is to assume that the non-linear dynamics can be approximated by a linear system with random noise (New- man, 2013; Shin et al., 2020), usually Gaussian. In this paper, we seek a different strategy in which we explicitly model the non-linear term of the dynamics with a neural network. In particular, our neural network resembles a Resnet (He et al., 2016) with the difference that, instead of the identity, the bypass is the DMD solution. Initializing the non-linear path with small random weights makes the untrained network predict the DMD solution. After train- ing, however, results improve compared with this baseline (similar to (Rodrigues et al., 2018)). In the next sections, we present our proposed approach, which we call the Residual DMD Neural Network (Res- DMD), and apply it to predict sea surface temperature (SST), comparing it to the standard DMD and a state-of-art dynam- ical model, CFSv2. 2. Background and Contributions In this section, we describe the architecture of our network and the rationale for its structure. We deﬁne what the initial- ization is and the beneﬁt of this choice. Finally, we describe the training procedure, which, in the current stage of this work, could be further optimized, but we leave this as future work.Decadal Forecasts with ResDMD: a Residual DMD Neural Network A multidimensional environmental variable x(typically an anomaly with respect to the long-term average, i.e. the climate mean), whose components extend over the spatial domain, can be modeled as: dx dt=Lx+N(x) (3) where Lis the linear part of the dynamics, and Nrepresents nonlinear terms.

This approach has the major beneﬁt of easiness to compute, since it relies on the computationally efﬁcient singular value decompo- sition (SVD) algorithm. Nonetheless, one can only fully understand the system statistics by knowing the form of N.
