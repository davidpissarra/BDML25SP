This method uses input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to rep- resent the mapping between the upper-level (agent) decisions and the lower-level (market) outcomes, i.e., to replace the lower-level problem by a neural network. In a comparative analysis, the optimal bidding problem of a load agent is formulated via the proposed MPNNC and via the classical bi-level programming method, and compared against each other. 1 Introduction and Background Electricity markets, the cornerstone of energy transition, are governed by systematic principles such as technical constraints and economic objectives. Consequently market actors and policy makers are interested in deﬁning a mathematical model that well-captures these market dynamics inside their reward (proﬁt, or social welfare) maximization problem. In power systems, this goal is mostly achieved by modeling a Stackelberg-game [ 1] via a bi-level program, which can be further translated into a single-level mathematical program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC) [ 2,3]. This modeling strategy poses many numerical challenges due to the inherent non-convex and nonlinear nature of the market clearing (lower-level). Additionally, the lower-level parameters are usually partially known for the modeler, such as the constraints of the market agents or the \"true\" (often imperfect) objective function of the participants. Reinforcement learning (RL) may be seen as an alternative to the model-based MPEC approach, leading to a fully data-driven solution method wherein the optimal policy is directly learned from interactions with the physical environment, as utilized in the works of [ 4–6]. The RL theory assumes that the system dynamics do not depend explicitly on time [ 7]. In a market environment wherein market dynamics are quickly varying this may jeopardize the speed and quality of the learning process. Moreover, most RL algorithms consider that the state of the system is fully observable. In reality, a market agent ignores the operating conditions of its competitors, and must thus cope with a partially observable system state, which complicates the problem. Motivated by the above challenges in existing model-based and model-free optimal bidding strategies, this paper proposes a hybrid modeling strategy that combines the strengths of both approaches by Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.2 Methodology 2 recasting the problem as a Mathematical Program with Neural Network Constraint (MPNNC). In power systems research, solution strategies combining optimization methods with neural networks (NNs) have been only formulated to capture the feasible space of non-convex optimal power ﬂow problems [ 8–11], thus reducing the computational burden. In this work, we instead aim to leverage the learning abilities of neural networks to propose a data-driven representation of the (imperfectly known) LL problem in a bi-level structure. In order to enhance the solution quality of the proposed MPNNC, we employ input convex neural networks (ICNNs) [ 12], in a similar fashion as they were exploited for optimal control applications [ 13–15]. The results of the MPNNC models are benchmarked against the classical MPEC approach in an ideal simulation environment, where the MPEC can explicitly capture the market dynamics. 2 Methodology 2.1 The chained input convex NN for capturing the electricity market (represented as an economics dispatch problem) Let us assume that the electricity market clearing, formulated as an optimization problem subject to a set of constraints, characterizes (i) the mapping between its inputs x(e.g. the participant’s quantity bids: { Gi\u0001AFi,t,Dt}, and price bids: cgen i) and the resulting dispatch ( yDP=gi,t) of the generation fED:x7!yDP, (ii) the mapping between the resulting dispatch and corresponding price (\u0015), which is deﬁned by the merit order curve fMO:yDP7!\u0015. After connecting the two functions, the relationship between the price formation of the electricity market (EM) and its inputs may be captured as: fEM:x7!\u0015. The detailed ED problem, describing the simulated environment, is presented in Appendix A. Since the electricity market price formation may be seen as a composition of two sub-problems, the proposed NN model also contains two chained learning models. NN(x,\u0012)denotes the neural network, where \u0012refers to the weights Wand biases bparameters, and xto the vector of input features. The optimal weights and biases are obtained in the ex-ante training that minimizes the mean-squared-error (MSE) loss function: \u0012\u0003= arg minyjj^y\u0000yjj2 2. The training is split into two parts, (i) ﬁtting the dispatch forecast yED=NNED(\u0012ED,x), (ii) ﬁtting the price forecast given the results of of the forecasted dispatch \u0015=NNEM(\u0012EM,y\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
