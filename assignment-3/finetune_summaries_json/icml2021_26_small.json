Introduction As one of the most consumed fruits worldwide, bananas had a global retail value between US $20 and $25 billion in 2016 (BananaLink). However, banana production faces a pre- dominant leaf-spot infectious disease called black Sigatoka (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2013). Caused by the fungal plant pathogen Mycosphaerella ﬁjiensis, the disease leads to premature ripening and a 30 - 50% loss in yields (Queensland Government, 2021). Be- tween 2007 and 2009, St. Vincent and the Grenadines even faced a 90% decline in banana crop production due to black *Equal contribution1Department of Computer Science, Uni- versity of Toronto, Toronto, Canada.

The current protection measures include applying expensive fungicides regularly, which account for up to 40% of the cost of banana production (approximately $520 million per year globally) (Joint Genome Institute, U.S. Department of Energy, 2013). Nevertheless, many local farmers in de- veloping countries have no access to disease management facilities due to ﬁnancial boundaries (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2013). Thus, predicting upcoming M. ﬁjiensis infections on banana plants would allow farmers to take appropriate preventative measures and mitigate disease management costs.
