However, dynamics of the injected CO 2plume is uncertain and the potential for leakage back to the atmosphere must be assessed. Thus, accurate and timely forecasts of CO 2storage via real-time measurements integration becomes very crucial. This study proposes a learning-based, inverse-free prediction method that can accurately and rapidly forecast CO 2movement and distribution with uncertainty quantiﬁcation based on limited simulation and observation data. The machine learning techniques include dimension reduction, multivariate data analysis, and Bayesian learning. The outcome is expected to provide CO 2storage site operators with an effective tool for real-time decision making. 1 Introduction Carbon capture and storage (CCS) has been proposed as a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions so as to address the global climate crisis [ 15,1]. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimated that capturing carbon at a modern conventional power plant could reduce CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere by approximately 80-90% compared to a plant that doesn’t have the technology to remove carbon [ 11]. Once the carbon has been captured, it must be stored. An approach of interest is to inject CO 2into deep saline aquifers [ 8]. However, understanding and data are signiﬁcantly lacking in these aquifers[ 5]. More importantly, leakage of CO 2into overlying resource-bearing strata, protected groundwater aquifers, and back into atmosphere could also be a problem for saline aquifer storage [ 4]. Uncertainty associated with predicting subsurface response to CO2injection and storage is a key barrier to developers seeking to secure ﬁnancing, permits, and social license to inject CO 2into deep underground [ 13,6]. Providing CO 2storage site operators with forecasting tools for real-time decision making is essential to address these barriers to CCS project development and management. Delivering on this need requires transformational changes in how we predict geologic carbon storage and update those predictions using real-time measurements. The traditional workﬂow for predicting CO 2distribution in a geological reservoir relies heavily on inverse modeling (history matching, model calibration) to constrain uncertain parameters in complex reservoir simulation models [ 2,14]. This inversion-based prediction approach has limitations for rapid integration of streaming data and providing real-time decision support due to the following Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021reasons: (1) Model inversion is computationally expensive and can require thousands of expensive reservoir model simulations, which need to be performed iteratively rather than concurrently and thus cannot take full advantage of contemporary parallel computing resources. (2) Model inversion can be numerically ill-posed resulting in poor predictions when the number of parameters is greater than the measurements, which is usually the case in CO 2storage simulation. (3) Model inversion needs to be repeated when incorporating new measurements. To address these challenges, our research aims to develop machine learning (ML) techniques with potential to provide step-change improvements in forecasts relative to the conventional history matching-based forecasts, thus enhancing the timeliness and accuracy of information provided to the operator. This paper describes our methods and analyzes their performance in predicting CO2distribution at a commercial scale reservoir. Our project is part of a large initiative called SMART (Science-informed Machine Learning for Accelerating Real Time Decisions in Subsurface Applications) funded by U.S. Department of Energy with the goal to enable better decisions in CO 2 sequestration given scarce resources in a highly uncertain subsurface. 2 Method We propose a Learning-based Inversion-free Prediction (LIP) framework that produces real-time prediction with uncertainty quantiﬁcation via integrating observation streams with parallel forward simulations. The key idea of LIP framework is to circumvent the challenging inverse modeling by precomputing an ensemble of unconstrained forward simulations and then using ML methods to learn the relationship between simulated observation and prediction variables. Once the ML model has learned the relationship, it can be used to continually update predictions of future system behavior based on streaming and multiple sources of observations to enable rapid data assimilation and real-time decision support. Speciﬁcally, LIP consists of four steps: 1.Generate prior samples of observation and prediction variables by running forward models based on the prior distribution of model parameters; 2. Dimension reduction of the simulated observations and predictions; 3.Establish a statistical relationship between observation and prediction in reduced dimension; 4. Bayesian inference of the prediction based on the statistical model with observation data. Steps 1-3 correspond to the training stage, where the observation-prediction relationship in the reduced dimension is learned from unconstrained forward simulations. Step 4 corresponds to the prediction stage, where the posterior distribution of the prediction is deduced from the observed data after back transformation to its original high-dimensional space. In LIP, dimension reduction is important for effective learning of the observation-prediction rela- tionship. In carbon storage simulation, the prediction variables and observation variables are usually spatial images and time\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
