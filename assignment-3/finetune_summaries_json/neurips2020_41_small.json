Speciﬁcally, our model mimics the structure of the building thermal dynamics model and leverages penalty methods to model inequality constraints. Additionally, we use constrained matrix parameterization based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem to bound the eigenvalues of the learned network weights. We interpret the stable eigenvalues as dissipa- tiveness of the learned building thermal model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a dataset obtained from an ofﬁce building with 20 thermal zones. 1 Introduction Energy-efﬁcient buildings are one of the top priorities to sustainably address the global energy demands and reduction of the CO 2emissions [ 1,2]. Advanced control strategies for buildings have been identiﬁed as a potential solution with projected energy saving potential up to 28% [3,4,5]. The current state of the art approaches in the domain are based on constrained optimal control methods and heavily depend on the mathematical models of the building dynamics [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The building thermal behavior is characterized by high-dimensional, nonlinear, and often discontinu- ous dynamics, for which modeling requires expertise and development time [11, 12, 13]. Moreover, high computational demands and non-differentiability can easily cast the physics-based model as not suitable for efﬁcient gradient-based optimization that is typically used in various applications. Data-driven system identiﬁcation typically represents a more cost-efﬁcient alternative [ 14,15,16,17]. However, purely-black box models require a large amount of data and may not generalize well outside the training distribution [ 18,19]. On the other hand, identifying accurate and reliable physics-based models with constrained from data remains a challenging task and involves solving difﬁcult non- convex optimization problems [ 20,21,22]. As a consequence, many of the current control-oriented modeling approaches for buildings still rely on crude approximations assuming low-order linear dynamics [23, 24, 25], which may hamper the overall potential control performance [26]. In this paper we show how to train physics-constrained recurrent neural dynamics models tailored to efﬁciently learn the building thermal dynamics in an end-to-end fashion, with physically coherent generalization, from small datasets. From a deep learning perspective, the presented model is inspired by a family of neural state-space models (SSM) [ 27,28,29,30,31], representing structurally modiﬁed vanilla RNNs tailored for the modeling of dynamical systems for control. To the author’s best knowledge, this is the ﬁrst combined use of structured recurrent neural architectures with physics-inspired constraints applied to a real-world building thermal dynamics modeling problem.

The typical building envelope dynamics is represented by a model with a graph structure shown in Fig. 1a. Mathematically, the thermal building model is given as the following differential equation with nonlinear input and disturbance dynamics: xt+1=Axt+But+fd(dt); (1a) yt=Cxt; (1b) ut=_mtcp\u0001Tt; (1c) where xtandytrepresent the values of the states (envelope temperatures), and measurements (zone temperatures) at time t, respectively.

For instance, the Amatrix represents 1-D heat transfer between the spatially discretized system states.Bmatrix deﬁnes the temperature increments caused by the convective heat ﬂow (1c)generated by the HV AC system, while fdcaptures highly nonlinear thermal dynamics caused by the weather conditions or internal heat gains generated by the occupancy. However, every building represents a unique system with different operational conditions.
