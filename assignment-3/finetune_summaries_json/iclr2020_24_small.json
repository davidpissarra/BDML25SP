We propose an implementation of a pricing agent with a reinforcement learning approach where the environment is represented by the customers, the electricity generation utilities and the weather conditions. 1 I NTRODUCTION The intermittence of renewable energy sources in the present electric energy generation systems poses an issue to electric utilities and electricity markets. These are built on the notion that supply follows demand (Denholm et al., 2015). Their integration in the present energy markets, due to the lack of scalable storage solutions (de Sisternes et al., 2016), can be most efﬁciently addressed by demand response (Bird et al., 2013). Demand response deﬁnes changes in the electric usage by consumers from their normal preferences caused by changes in electricity prices or by other incentives (Agency et al., 2003). With demand response through real time pricing (Agency et al., 2003), utilities can shift the customer load demand to periods of excess renewable energy generation. These peaks of generated energy are caused by high renewable energy generation, while the load demand is low. The shifting of customer load demand can result with reducing the greenhouse gasses emissions by natural gas and coal electricity generation plants, used at times of peak demand or for back up generation (Bird et al., 2013). 2 R ELATED WORK Previous research on using reinforcement learning for dynamic pricing in hierarchical markets has shown promising results, both in balancing of the supply and demand, as well as in cutting the costs for customers and electric utilities alike (Lu et al., 2018). If a reinforcement learning model for customer load scheduling is also included, there is a cost reduction on the both sides when compared to myopic optimization (Kim et al., 2016). However, there is no application of these methods in a physical environment. This is due to the lack of a simulation environment which can provide a reliable estimate of the safety and cost of the proposed method. To this end, we propose a simulation environment and adding weather data as an input to our proposed agent. 3 R EINFORCEMENT LEARNING APPROACH To model this problem as an reinforcement learning problem (Sutton & Barto, 2018), we choose the electric utility to represent the pricing agent.

These systems are built on the notion that supply follows demand (Denholm et al., 2015). The integration of renewable energy sources into these markets, due to the lack of scalable storage solutions (de Sisternes et al., 2016), can be most efficiently addressed by demand response (Bird et al., 2013). Demand response defines changes in electric usage by consumers from their normal preferences caused by changes in electricity prices or other incentives (Agency et al., 2003). With demand response through real-time pricing (Agency et al., 2003), utilities can shift customer load demand to periods of excess renewable energy generation. These peaks of generated energy are caused by high renewable energy generation, while the load demand is low. Shifting customer load demand can result in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas and coal electricity generation plants, used at times of peak demand or for backup generation (Bird et al., 2013).\n\n**Related Work**\n\nPrevious research on using reinforcement learning for dynamic pricing in hierarchical markets has shown promising results, both in balancing supply and demand, as well as in cutting costs for customers and electric utilities alike (Lu et al., 2018). If a reinforcement learning model for customer load scheduling is also included, there is a cost reduction on both sides when compared to myopic optimization (Kim et al., 2016). However, there is no application of these methods in a physical environment. This is due to the lack of a simulation environment that can provide a reliable estimate of the safety and cost of the proposed method. To this end, we propose a simulation environment and adding weather data as an input to our proposed agent.\n\n**Reinforcement Learning Approach**\n\nTo model this problem as a reinforcement learning problem (Sutton & Barto, 2018), we choose the electric utility to represent the pricing agent. For the state s_t, we choose to be represented by the momentary and future renewable electricity supply to the electric utility, the momentary customer load demand, and the momentary and future features of the real world used for electricity demand forecasting (Gajowniczek & Zabkowski, 2017; Paterakis et al., 2017; Mocanu et al., 2016). At each timestep t, the electric utility as the agent selects an action a_t, which is represented by the momentary and future electricity prices. This action is then transmitted back to the customers, which as a part of the environment responds with a load demand. This load demand is then used to calculate the reward r_t. Now, the pricing agent is in another state s_{t+1} and this whole process is repeated for the duration of the simulation period, which is previously chosen. The environment and the agent are shown in Fig. 1.\n\nSince it is often the case that renewable electricity sources are not in the vicinity of customers, we set the future supply to be given as an input. The momentary demand, momentary and future renewable energy, its price, weather data, and the temporal data are of dimensions P+1, while the energy selling price, i.e., the action, is of dimension 1. This way, the pricing agent formulates the price having as input the expectation for the P future states. The size of the timestep and P are treated as hyperparameters of the learning problem.\n\n**Reward Function**\n\nThe two objectives of the proposed pricing agent are to decrease the difference between the supply of renewable energy and demand and to keep the energy utility profitable. We propose the global reward function to be a linear combination of two sub-rewards as in the multi-objective analysis of return, shown in Eq. (1), proposed by Dulac-Arnold et al. (2019).\n\nr(s;a) = ∑_{j=1}^2 r_j(s;a) (1)\n\nwhere:\n\nr_1(s;a) = (Price sold(s;a) - Price purchased) (2)\n\nand\n\nr_2(s;a) = -(Energy renewable - Edemand(s))"
