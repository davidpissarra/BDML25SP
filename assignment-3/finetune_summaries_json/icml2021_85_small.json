The project explores the two approaches with a simulation testbed in EnergyPlus and experiments in build- ings on a university campus. 1. Introduction Building energy consumption represents one-third of the United States’ greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the largest of any sector (EPA, 2021). The Biden administration has set a target of a 50% reduction in 2005 GHG emissions by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050 (White-House, 2021). Achieving these targets will require deep decarbonization across all sectors. This is particularly challenging in the building sector given that the existing building stock is large and there is relatively low turnover. Thus, to achieve such deep decarbonization targets the US must simultaneously create energy-efﬁcient new buildings while lowering energy consumption in existing buildings. A signiﬁcant fraction of the GHG emissions in buildings is due to heating and air conditioning. In residential build- ings they represent about one-third of energy consumption, 1Department of Architecture, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. 2Concrete Sustainability Hub, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.3MIT- IBM Watson AI Lab, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA.4Climate and Sustainability Consortium, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA. 5Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, MIT, Cambridge, MA, USA..

Many energy systems and build- ing envelope technologies are being implemented to reduce heating and cooling demands. While these are important, they are also capital intensive. An alternative approach is to adjust building temperature set-points to lower energy consumption and GHG emis- sions. The mechanism has two components. First, energy consumption can be reduced by limiting heating or cooling when a space is unoccupied, by learning behavioral patterns. Second, electricity-derived heating or cooling can be timed to coincide with low GHG emissions from the electrical grid and avoided during times of high emissions. Adjust- ing building temperature set-points requires little capital investment. Depending on the energy system being used, it may only require changes to software and/or thermostats, as opposed to changes in the much more expensive heating and cooling systems. Numerous smart thermostats for residential buildings that rely on machine learning algorithms have been developed and are deployed in homes. Given that US residential and commercial GHG emissions are nearly the same (EPA, 2021), there is a signiﬁcant opportunity to implement build- ing temperature set-point machine learning algorithms for commercial buildings as well. This is a challenging task due to the scale and complexity of commercial buildings and the complicated management systems used to regulate temperatures. The application of machine learning methods to commer- cial building heating and cooling systems is a well-studied ﬁeld. In the review paper (Rolnick et al., 2019), these ap- plications are broadly categorized as (a) building energy modeling and (b) optimizing energy use. The review paper (Esraﬁlian-Najafabadi & Haghighat, 2021) adds a further category (c), occupancy prediction. The project proposed here will eventually span all three categories, though this paper focuses on (a) and (b). Relative to existing research, the primary contribution of the project proposed here will be experimental validation in a real building, which we have instrumented with energy submeters, people counters, and other sensors. A secondary contribution will be optimizingReducing GHG Emissions by Optimizing Room Temperature set-points for GHG emissions, rather than more common performance criteria such as energy consumption and operating costs. In (Esraﬁlian-Najafabadi & Haghighat, 2021), both experimen- tal validation and new performance criteria are identiﬁed as important areas for future research. 2. Methods Figure 2 illustrates the proposed GHG minimization frame- work. It involves two steps: (1) learning a model to predict energy consumption based on temperature set-points and other features, and (2) using the learned model and daily pre- dictions of occupancy and the GHG intensity of electricity to decide set-point proﬁles that minimize GHG emissions. Speciﬁcally, we have developed an EnergyPlus model of the room we will control, then simulated operations un- der a wide variety of weather, occupancy, and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
