These surrogate models train on observational data capturing either the embed- dings of their (subgrid scale processes’) underly- ing dynamics on the large scale processes or to simulate the subgrid processes accurately to be fed into the large scale processes. In this paper an extended version of the Lorenz 96 system is stud- ied, which consists of three equations for a set of slow, intermediate, and fast variables, providing a ﬁtting prototype for multi-scale, spatio-temporal chaos, and in particular, the complex dynamics of the climate system. In this work, we have built a data-driven model based on echo state net- works (ESN) aimed, speciﬁcally at climate mod- eling. This model can predict the spatio-temporal chaotic evolution of the Lorenz system for sev- eral Lyapunov timescales. We show that the ESN model outperforms, in terms of the prediction horizon, a deep learning technique based on recur- rent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) and an artiﬁcial neural network by factors between 3 and 10. The results suggest that ESN has the potential for being a powerful method for surrogate modeling and data-driven prediction for problems of interest to the climate community. *Equal contribution1Department of Mechanical Engineering, Rice University,Houston2Department of Earth Environmental and Planetary Sciences, Rice University,Houston3Department of Com- puter Science, Rice University, Houston.

Introduction There has been a lot of effort put into deep learning in recent times to parameterize complex non-linear physical processes in climate models especially for clouds and deep convection (Rasp et al., 2018; Gentine et al., 2018). These efforts arise from the ever demanding need of immense computational expense to resolve subgrid scale processes such as clouds, gravity waves, submesoscale eddies, sea ice etc., (Collins et al., 2006). Machine learning can pro- vide a solution to this challenge by providing data-driven surrogate models of the subgrid-scale physics needing high resolution (Reichstein et al., 2019). In such cases either the surrogate model feeds the parametrized values into the climate model, or the effects of subgrid-scale processes on the large scale circulation in the climate model is learned through observation or simulation of the large scale data itself. In this paper we propose a data-driven solution to the multi- scale climate system which is represented by the 3-tier Lorenz 96 equations (Thornes et al., 2017). The proposed data-driven model (details in section 3) is restricted to train only on the low frequency large amplitude variable over a training period and expected to freely predict this vari- able in future time steps by learning the hidden embed- dings of the intermediate and high frequency variables that are coupled with the large scale variable (see section 2). This system exhibits fully chaotic multi-scale dynamics and serves as a ﬁtting prototype to test a modiﬁed echo state net- work (Jaeger, 2001), which has been previously found to be promising in systems exhibiting chaotic dynamics (Pathak et al., 2018). We show that our network provides predictions up to multiple Lyapunov exponents (or earth-days) and out- performs state-of-the-art deep learning approaches such as RNN-LSTM and previously reported prediction horizon by fully connected neural networks (Dueben & Bauer, 2018).Data-driven surrogate models for climate modeling Figure 1.
