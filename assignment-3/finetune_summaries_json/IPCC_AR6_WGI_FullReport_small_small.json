Recent changes are rapid, intensifying, and unprecedented over centuries to thousands of years. With each additional increment of  warming, these changes will become larger, resulting in long-lasting,  irreversible implications, in particular for sea level rise. United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has stated that ‘the evidence is  irrefutable’ and ‘we see the warning signs in every continent and region’. The Working Group I contribution to the Intergovernmental Panel  on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report provides a reality check on climate change. We now have a much clearer picture of the past, present and possible future climates, and this information is essential for understanding where we are headed, what can be  done, and the multiple facets of a changing climate to prepare for,  in every region. Unless deep reductions in greenhouse gas emissions occur in the coming decades, global warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels will be exceeded during the 21st century.  The new Working Group I Report structure integrates multiple lines  of scientific evidence within each chapter and provides robust knowledge relevant for policymaking through the end-to-end assessment of key topics. This more holistic approach has resulted in  a report that provides a better understanding of the climate system,  for both past and future changes, with a new emphasis on climate information for regions, which is critical for informing adaptation and risk management strategies. Today, many decisions remain grounded in the experience of past climate variability. This report provides  a solid basis for taking into account future changes that need to be  considered in today’s decisions, with increased relevance for climate services, to enhance adaptation and resilience to climate change and curb greenhouse gas emissions.The journey of this report reflects extraordinary efforts by all contributors under exceptional circumstances. The COVID-19 pandemic, which started during the review of the Second Order  Draft, disrupted the process. However, the early response of Working  Group I, through the hard work of the authors, review editors, chapter scientists, the Technical Support Unit, and Bureau members, made  it possible to deliver a report that meets the most stringent science  quality standards, thanks to the in-depth, broad review process, with  an exhaustive, robust, rigorous and transparent assessment of the  latest state of climate science knowledge. We commend the additional efforts taken, including by all reviewers from the research community and government representatives who adapted to a new way of working to complete this vital report. Our particular appreciation goes to the  Working Group I Co-Chairs Valérie Masson-Delmotte and Panmao Zhai  for their leadership throughout the process. Their extraordinary efforts ensured that this robust and clear report is available to the world today. This Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment  Report covers important new advances in climate science that provide an invaluable input into climate negotiations and decision-making, with an emphasis on key conditions that, from a physical science basis, are needed to limit global warming and inform risk  assessment and regional adaptation.
