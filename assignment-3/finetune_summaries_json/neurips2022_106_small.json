In our work, we propose extracting features by con- sidering the atmosphere and land moisture and energy budgets and forecasting global droughts on a seasonal and an annual scale at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months lead times. SPI helps us to identify the severity and the duration of the drought to classify them as meteorological, agricultural and hydrological. 1 Introduction Climate change will increase the likelihood of extreme climatic events such as heatwaves, drought, excessive rainfall, wildfires, and floods, with severe negative impacts on food security, supply chains, and the world economy [1]. Droughts are a major risk to food security [2]. 700 million people suffer from malnutrition and hunger [3], leading to lower immunity, delayed development [4] and an increased risk of chronic diseases [5]. Heatwaves and droughts together are often a pre-condition to wildfires [6]. The economic cost of a single drought is estimated to be up to 9.6 billion US dollars [7]. However, predicting droughts to mitigate their impacts is challenging due to the slow onset of the event and varying degrees of dependence on numerous physical and socio-economic factors that differentiate droughts from other natural disasters [1]. Recently developed machine learning methods, computational resources and earth observation datasets can aid global drought forecasting [8]. Water in the Earth system is cycled between its gaseous, liquid and solid forms and remains effectively constant on timescales relevant to drought prediction (months-years) [9]. When there is water deficit over a prolonged period of time at the land (agricultural), in the atmosphere (meteorological) or underground (hydrological) level, the region is said to be experiencing a drought [1] (Figure 1). In this work, we propose extracting features by considering the relevant atmosphere and land moisture and energy budgets [9] and predicting global droughts by modelling SPI (Standardised Precipitation Index) on a seasonal and an annual scale and predicting precipitation at 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months lead times using our deep learning model. SPI helps us to identify the severity and the duration of the drought to classify them as meteorological, agricultural and hydrological [10]. 2 Related Work Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) is a drought index and is used to measure droughts [11]. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) recommends all countries to use SPI for monitoring and Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Physical constraints on droughts and drought subtypes [26, 28, 29]. reporting purposes [12]. Several algorithms based on stochastic, probabilistic, and machine learning techniques have been proposed in the literature to forecast SPI at multiple regional and temporal scales. Machine learning models such as Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [13], Wavelet ANN [14, 15], Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) [16], Convolutional LSTM [17], integrated ANN [18], and Transformers [10, 19, 20] have been successful for precipitation and drought forecasting individually [15, 21, 22, 23]. The majority of existing machine-learning drought prediction techniques train separate models for each region [24, 25, 26, 27, 19]. Models confined to a small region are not able to learn patterns that are consistent over different types of heterogeneous regions, are more likely to overfit to regional observational data in earth observation (EO) datasets and less likely to be used by environmental stakeholders [19]. However, recent work suggests that a location agnostic, as opposed to location specific approach, may be preferable for drought forecasting, [19], indicating that global drought forecasting is a promising direction. 3 Dataset The dataset for DeepXD is curated to predict SPI and is characterised by a temporal coverage from 1982 to 2018 at a monthly resolution (444 timesteps), and spatial coverage across the globe at a resolution of 0.5 x 0.5 degree. The input variables are processed and re-sampled to the specified resolution after being collected from the global dataset ERA5 (atmospheric winds and humidity at 850, 500 and 250 hPa, near-surface (2m) temperature, surface pressure, soil moisture (at 4 levels), soil temperature (at 4 levels), surface and subsurface runoff, shortwave and longwave radiative heat fluxes, sensible heat fluxes, evaporation, precipitation, land-sea mask, leaf area index for low and high vegetation) [30], the oceanic indices are collected from NOAA [31] and the target variable is SPI, computed from precipitation from the global land dataset WFDE5 [32].
