By training the ML parameterization on high-resolution simulation data, we aim to improve Earth System Models (ESMs) in comparison to traditional parameterization schemes. We investigate the usage of a multilayer perceptron (MLP) with feature engineering and physics-constraints, and use explainability techniques to understand the relationship between input features and model output. Our novel approach yields promising results, with the physics-informed ML-based cloud microphysics parameterization achieving an R2score up to 0.777 for an individual feature. Additionally, we demonstrate a notable improvement in the overall performance in comparison to a baseline MLP, increasing its average R2score from 0.290 to 0.613 across all variables. This approach to improve the representation of cloud microphysics in ESMs promises to enhance climate projections, contributing to a better understanding of climate change. 1 I NTRODUCTION Machine learning (ML) made great strides in enhancing Earth System Models (ESMs) by replacing traditional parameterizations that are based on empirical and physical understanding and represent the statistical effect of a given process at the grid scale of the climate model (Rasp et al., 2018; Reichstein et al., 2019; Eyring et al., 2023b). For this, typically ML models are trained on high-resolution climate simulations or observations and then coupled to the coarse climate model, potentially eliminating long-standing biases in ESMs (Gentine et al., 2021; Grundner et al., 2022; 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024 Eyring et al., 2023a). However, in the literature, the cloud microphysics parameterization has only been emulated on the same resolution as the simulation data (Gettelman et al., 2021; Han et al., 2020; Perkins et al., 2023). Therefore, this study presents a novel approach for learning the cloud microphysics parameterization by incorporating higher resolution dynamics into the lower resolution ESM. This will be especially beneficial when parameterizing cloud convection together with cloud microphysics in future studies. The parameterization of cloud microphysics is central in traditional ESMs, working closely coupled to the convection scheme in order to model the behavior of clouds. It calculates the formation, growth and removal of cloud liquid water particles and captures phase changes. Additionally, cloud microphysics processes impact the lifetime of clouds, the water vapor distribution outside of clouds, the fluxes of water and radiation through the atmosphere, and latent heating. We aim to enhance the representation of subgrid-scale cloud microphysics within the coarse-scale Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic modeling framework (ICON) (Z ¨angl et al., 2014; Giorgetta et al., 2018), which traditionally employs the single moment microphysical scheme (Lohmann & Roeckner, 1996). This scheme focuses on prognostic equations for the mass mixing ratios (MMRs) of water vapor, cloud liquid water, cloud ice, and rain. In order to improve upon this baseline, we propose the development of an ML-based parameterization that is trained on ICON simulation data that uses the more complex graupel scheme (Rutledge & Hobbs, 1984; Baldauf et al., 2011). The graupel scheme not only calculates the MMR of snow and graupel but also provides precipitation rates for rain, snow, and graupel. Moreover, the use of high-resolution simulation data allows us to incorporate the statistical effects of higher-resolved dynamics into the ML model. This holds the potential to further improve the cloud microphysics parameterization and enhance the accuracy of ESMs. 2 M ETHODOLOGY 2.1 U NDERLYING DATASET We generate high-resolution data through a simulation setup utilizing the atmospheric component of ICON Sapphire (Hohenegger et al., 2023; NextGems, 2024) with a horizontal resolution of roughly 5 km.
