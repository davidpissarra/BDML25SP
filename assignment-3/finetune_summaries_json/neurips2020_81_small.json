Harmful algae and algal blooms are predicted to increase in frequency and extent due to the warming climate, but microbial dynamics remain difﬁcult to predict. Existing satellite remote sensing monitoring technologies are ill-equipped to discriminate harmful algae, while models do not adequately capture the complex controls on algal populations. This proposal explores the potential for Bayesian neural networks to detect phytoplankton pigments from hyperspectral remote sensing reﬂectance retrievals. Once developed, such a model could enable hyperspectral remote sensing retrievals to support decision making in water resource management as more advanced ocean color satellites are launched in the coming decade. While uncertainty quantiﬁcation motivates the proposed use of Bayesian models, the interpretation of these uncertainties in an operational context must be carefully considered. 1 Introduction Coastal waters support ﬁsheries, which provide livelihoods and recreation for nearby communities. Reservoirs and lakes are major sources of drinking water. These aquatic systems are increasingly experiencing anthropogenic stresses from population growth and land development, along with longer term shifts in temperature from a changing climate. These water bodies are full of microscopic life, which serve as the primary producers for aquatic ecosystems and mediate biogeochemical processes. Over past decades, rising temperatures and increasing pollution have been linked to ecosystem shifts such as higher occurrences of harmful algal blooms ( 1) and low-oxygen waters caused by excessive algal growth ( 2). Harmful algae release toxins that can cause illness and even death when ingested directly or indirectly through shellﬁsh poisoning. Low oxygen waters are uninhabitable to ﬁsh and other benthos, resulting in massive ﬁsh kills. Due to the ecological importance of aquatic microbes, oceanographers have deployed advanced technologies to monitor and study their population dynamics. Polar-orbiting ocean color satellites provide observations of the world’s oceans every few days. Geostationary ocean color satellites Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Figure 1: Harmful algal bloom at a drinking water intake in Lake Eerie. (Photo Credit epa.gov) examine one region of the earth, providing multiple observations per hour. These satellites have historically carried multi-spectral spectrometers, which senses the Earth’s radiance at a several discrete wavelengths from the ultraviolet to near infrared. Both types of sensors have been employed for monitoring harmful algae ( 3) and phytoplankton dynamics ( 4), but are limited by their coarse spectral resolution. The future generation of United States’ ocean color sensors being developed will provide imagery at much greater spectral resolution, as the PACE (Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem) and GLIMR (Geosynchronous Littoral Imaging and Monitoring Radiometer) missions become operational in the coming decade. Existing algorithms for remote sensing of the environment typically employ a two-step approach that seeks to ﬁrst (1) remove the atmospheric interference between the sensor and the target and then (2) derive the geophysical parameter of interest from the atmosphere-corrected retrieval. In aquatic remote sensing, algorithms for atmospheric correction and parameter retrieval are largely derived from open ocean studies. However, these algorithms perform poorly in coastal and inland waters due to the complex mixtures of materials in the water and air (e.g. sediment, dissolved organic material, aerosols) speciﬁc to near-shore environments. Poor performance and the lack of a widely accepted uncertainty quantiﬁcation have limited their use for decision making in water resource management. The improved spectral resolution of future ocean color sensors are promising hardware advances, but must be accompanied by advances in retrieval algorithms suitable for the increase in information available. 2 Methods 2.1 Model Description & Training Data We propose the application Bayesian Neural Networks for monitoring microbial communities with hyperspectral sensors to support water resource management. Bayesian methodologies have been shown to improve accuracy in atmospheric correction ( 5) and in deriving biogeochemical information (6) for existing ocean color sensors over traditional algorithms. The appeal of the Bayesian approach for this problem is the ability to model the expectation and covariance of the posterior distribution, providing a measure of uncertainty for retrievals. In both ( 5;6), models were applied to a discrete set of wavelengths to match existing ocean color sensors, although the training and validation data are available at higher spectral resolution. Within this Bayesian framework, we propose the implementation of neural networks due to the high dimensionality of the input space associated with hyperspectral imagery. Speciﬁcally, the model proposed is a Bayesian neural network for predicting phytoplankton pigment concentrations [ mgm\u00003] from remote sensing reﬂectance ( Rrs(\u0015) [sr\u00001]).
