Nonlinearities, nonstationarities and the (ab)use of correlation analyses hamper the discovery of true causal pat- terns. We here introduce a deep learning method- ology that extracts nonlinear latent functions from spatio-temporal Earth data and that are Granger causal with the index altogether. We illustrate its use to study the impact of ENSO on vegetation, which allows for a more rigorous study of impacts on ecosystems globally. 1. Introduction The Earth is a complex, dynamic and networked system. Land, atmosphere and climate interact constantly, and at different spatial and temporal scales (Dijkstra, 2013). The study of the intertwined connections between all spheres is a subject of active research. A paradigmatic case in climate sciences are teleconnection patterns; atmospheric changes in one place may largely impact other processes in distant regions. Phenomena like El Ni ˜no-Southern Os- cillation (ENSO) or the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), change regimes and patterns of key essential variables like moisture, greenness and precipitation. Discovering spatio- temporal patterns is one of the main goals of the climate community, and the key to analyze andunderstand the un- derlying physical dynamics and processes driving the Earth system (Guttman, 1989; Larson, 2010). Summarizing such relations have typically relied on extract- ing principal components from spatio-temporal data cubes *Equal contribution1Image Processing Laboratory (IPL). Cor- respondence to: Gherardo Varando <gherardo.varando@uv.es >, Miguel- ´Angel Fern ´andez-Torres <miguel.a.fernandez@uv.es >.and analyzing their (linear) correlation with the ‘summariz- ing index’ (e.g. ENSO or NAO). A plethora of both linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction have been used: ex- tensions of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) (Bauer- Marschallinger et al., 2013; V olkov, 2014; Forootan et al., 2016) that seek for rotated (Lian & Chen, 2012), oblique (Hendrickson & White, 1964), and Varimax (Kaiser, 1958) transformations, as well as more powerful nonlinear meth- ods based on neural networks (Hsieh et al., 2006), Gaussian processes (Luttinen & Ilin, 2009), low-rank tensor represen- tations (Yu et al., 2015) and kernel methods (Bueso et al., 2020). Then, a simple lag-correlation analysis between the modes and the index of interest is performed. The approach is effective but two main -and critical- problems emerge: (1) the feature extraction is generally disconnected and learned independently from the index, which leads to a quite arbi- trary selection of the modes of variability explaining the phenomena, and importantly (2) the (ab)use of correlation analysis typically leads to spurious detections, which do not tell anything about true causal effects. In this paper we introduce a methodology to address both problems jointly. Learning representations is now best done with neural net- works, like autoencoders, normalizing ﬂows or unsupervised convolutional networks (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006; Goodfellow et al., 2016; Romero et al., 2016; Reichstein et al., 2019; Camps-Valls et al., 2021). Neural networks cope well with highly structured (spatio-temporal) data, are computationally efﬁcient, and can be engineered to min- imize meaningful criteria. In our case, we aim to learn expressive representations that should be causal too. The goal can be thus framed within the recent ﬁeld of causal representation learning (Sch ¨olkopf et al., 2021), which aims to discover high-level causal variables from low-level ob- servations. Discovering teleconnections ﬁts nicely in this framework as fundamental observable variables are often spatio-temporal, while high level relationships between ag- gregated variables or indices are believed to hold. We propose learning Granger causal feature representations with neural networks. We introduce an autoencoder neural network (Hinton & Salakhutdinov, 2006) trained not only to optimize the reconstruction error but also the Granger causality criterion (Granger, 1980) between the latent repre- sentation and the index under study, e.g. ENSO or NAO. The architecture allows us to learn latent feature representationsLearning Granger Causal Feature Representations that are Granger causal with the target index. We illustrate its use in assessing the impact of ENSO on vegetation. 2. Granger penalized autoencoder A plethora of unsup\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

We introduce a deep learning methodology that extracts nonlinear latent functions from spatio-temporal Earth data and is Granger causal with the index altogether. This approach is illustrated by studying the impact of ENSO on vegetation, enabling a more rigorous study of its effects on ecosystems globally.\n\nThe Earth is a complex, dynamic, and networked system, with land, atmosphere, and climate interacting constantly across different spatial and temporal scales (Dijkstra, 2013). The study of interconnected relationships between these spheres is an active area of research. Teleconnection patterns, such as ENSO and the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), change regimes and patterns of essential variables like moisture, greenness, and precipitation. Discovering spatio-temporal patterns is a key goal of the climate community, and understanding the underlying physical dynamics and processes driving the Earth system is crucial (Guttman, 1989; Larson, 2010).\n\nTypically, summarizing such relations involves extracting principal components from spatio-temporal data cubes and analyzing their linear correlation with a summarizing index (e.g., ENSO or NAO). Various linear and nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques have been used, including extensions of Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF) and neural networks (Hsieh et al., 2006), Gaussian processes (Luttinen & Ilin, 2009), low-rank tensor representations (Yu et al., 2015), and kernel methods (Bueso et al., 2020). However, this approach has two main limitations: (1) feature extraction is often disconnected from the index, leading to arbitrary selection of modes of variability, and (2) correlation analysis can lead to spurious detections that do not indicate true causal effects.\n\nWe introduce a methodology to address these problems jointly. Our approach uses neural networks, such as autoencoders, normalizing flows, or unsupervised convolutional networks, to learn representations that are Granger causal with the index. This is framed within the field of causal representation learning (Scholkopf et al., 2021), which aims to discover high-level causal variables from low-level observations. We propose learning Granger causal feature representations with neural networks, where the autoencoder is trained to optimize both reconstruction error and Granger causality criterion (Granger, 1980) between the latent representation and the index under study.\n\nWe illustrate the use of this approach in assessing the impact of ENSO on vegetation."
