Such systems are usually controlled by adjusting the trajectory of the kite using Optimal Control techniques, such as Model-Predictive Control. These methods are based upon a mathematical model of the system to control, and they produce results that are strongly dependent on the specific model at use and difficult to generalize. Our aim is to replace these classical techniques with an approach based on Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can be used even in absence of a known model. Experimental results prove that RL is a viable method to control AWE systems in complex simulated environments, including turbulent flows. 1 Introduction In the field of renewable power sources, wind energy is particularly appealing since it can potentially power the entire world and it is largely available almost everywhere on the planet [ 1]. Currently, wind power generation happens through wind turbines, huge three-bladed devices often found in very large on-shore or off-shore wind farms. Airborne Wind Energy (AWE) is an alternative lightweight technology for wind energy harvesting, based on tethered flying devices, usually power kites. These devices fly under the effect of aerody- namic forces (drag and lift) and convert wind energy to electrical energy by means of a generator, which can be placed either directly on the device or on the ground [ 2]. Such technology promises to address most of the issues of traditional wind turbines, since kites can be controlled to fly at higher altitudes, where strong and constant winds can be found and since their smaller, lighter structure leads to much lower material costs and environmental impact [ 3,4]. However, AWE technology is operationally more complex than traditional turbines and it may face reliability issues in case of critical wind anomalies [5]. In order to safely and profitably operate an AWE system, the trajectory of the kite can be optimized by controlling its attack and bank angle through the lines that connect it to the ground station. Several Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: (A) Schematic representation of an AWE system in the yo-yo configuration [ 6].

However, there are two shortcomings to this approach. First, traditional Optimal Control techniques are strongly model-dependent, meaning that the control strategies they provide are usually hard to generalize from one configuration to another and that the quality of the results that can be achieved depends on the quality of the model. The issue can be partially tamed by applying Robust Control techniques [ 9]. Second, MPC for AWE usually focuses on minimizing the excursions from a predefined path [ 8], which in general is not the one that optimizes power production. This lack of alignment between the objective trajectory of MPC and the final optimization objective has been highlighted by recent research [ 10] in the context of drone navigation, showcasing the fact that the trajectories obtained with MPC may be suboptimal in real conditions. Such problem is particularly acute in changing environments like the turbulent atmosphere, where the kite should dynamically adapt its trajectory to wind fluctuations in order to efficiently extract energy. In this study, we take a different standpoint and give a proof of concept that classical control techniques can be replaced with Reinforcement Learning (RL), which can be used even in absence of a known model, to directly aim at the maximization of energy production. RL has already proven successful in addressing flight optimization problems [ 10,11,12] and it has already been employed in the context of AWE in a towing setting, in which kites are used to move a ship or a vehicle on the ground [ 13]. In this work, we present a way to control AWE systems with RL for electrical energy production. The code required to reproduce our results is publicly available at https://github.com/ lorenzobasile/KiteRL. 2 Methods In a RL setting, a decision maker (the agent) interacts with its surroundings (the environment) and based on this interaction it receives a numerical signal which can be seen as a reward (or a penalty) for the actions it took. By trial and error, on the long run the agent understands which actions are to be preferred in each state in order to maximize the reward it obtains from the environment and optimizes its decision-making strategy accordingly. We adopt two RL algorithms: SARSA [ 14] and TD3 (Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic policy gradient) [15]. SAR\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nAirborne Wind Energy (AWE) systems use tethered flying devices, typically power kites, to convert wind energy into electrical energy. These devices fly under the influence of aerodynamic forces and can be controlled to fly at higher altitudes where strong and constant winds are found. AWE technology offers several advantages over traditional wind turbines, including lower material costs and environmental impact. However, it is operationally more complex and may face reliability issues in critical wind conditions.\n\nTo safely and profitably operate an AWE system, the trajectory of the kite can be optimized by controlling its attack and bank angle through the lines connecting it to the ground station. Several studies have explored the application of Model-Predictive Control (MPC) to AWE systems, but this approach has two main shortcomings. Firstly, traditional Optimal Control techniques are strongly model-dependent, making it difficult to generalize control strategies across different configurations. Secondly, MPC for AWE often focuses on minimizing excursions from a predefined path, which may not be the optimal path for power production.\n\nIn this study, we propose an alternative approach using Reinforcement Learning (RL) to control AWE systems and maximize energy production. RL can be used even in the absence of a known model, making it a viable method for AWE control. Our approach has already been successful in addressing flight optimization problems and has been employed in the context of AWE in towing settings.\n\nWe adopt two RL algorithms, SARSA and TD3, to control AWE systems. In a RL setting, an agent interacts with its environment and receives a numerical signal as a reward or penalty for its actions. Through trial and error, the agent learns to optimize its decision-making strategy to maximize the reward. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/lorenzobasile/KiteRL.\n\nThe main contributions of this study are:\n\n* We propose a novel approach to control AWE systems using RL, which can be used even in the absence of a known model.\n* We demonstrate the effectiveness of RL in controlling AWE systems in complex simulated environments, including turbulent flows.\n* We provide a proof of concept that RL can be used to maximize energy production in AWE systems.\n\nOur results show that RL is a viable method for controlling AWE systems and can be used to address the limitations of traditional control techniques."
