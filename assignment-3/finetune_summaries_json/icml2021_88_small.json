However, many labeled geospatial datasets—including all of those used in the previously cited works—only cover speciﬁc regions of the world, limiting their utility and adop- tion elsewhere. Xu et al. explicitly cite this limitation as a focus of future work. Furthermore, these datasets are often limited to a single instrument and method of acquisition, limiting their generalization to acquisitions made by other instruments and at other angles. Domain adaptation attempts to leverage labeled “source” data toward learning on some separate “target” dataset, for which only unlabeled data exists. In the context of climate- focused machine learning, it provides a potential framework for scaffolding innovations beyond their limiting datasets to other areas, instruments, and contexts. 1Department of Electrical Engineering, NC State Univer- sity, Raleigh, North Carolina, USA2Masterful.AI, San Fran- cisco, California, USA.

We propose multiple geospatial domain- adaptation benchmarks, explore the challenges they pose to traditional domain-adaptation algorithms, and suggest methods of improvement. 2. Geospatial Domain Adaptation The application of domain adaptation to geospatial machine learning requires both datasets and methods tailored to the context of remote sensing. 2.1. Proposed Benchmarks For our initial experiments we propose two domain- adaptation benchmarks derived from the well-known SpaceNet datasets of labeled satellite imagery ( Etten et al., 2019 ). As noted by Dao et al. (2019 ), land use determines a signiﬁcant portion of human carbon emission; as such, we focus on building segmentation as a useful tool in the moni- toring and prediction of emissions. We measure the Jaccard index ( Jaccard,1912 ), or intersection over union (IoU), of target-dataset segmentations as our primary performance metric. SpaceNet-2 contains imagery and corresponding building annotations for four cities: Las Vegas, Paris, Shanghai, and Khartoum. We may treat one subset of cities as the “source” and another subset as the “target” and attempt adaptation from one to the other: for example, from Las Vegas to Khartoum. The ability to generalize building segmentation from well-labeled cities to growing ones in different areas of the world would greatly increase the utility of such methods. Given compute constraints, we restrict our experiments here to those treating Khartoum as the target dataset. SpaceNet-4 contains imagery of speciﬁc regions for varying angles off-nadir, loosely grouped into “on-nadir” for low angles, “off nadir” for moderate angles, and “very off-nadir” for large angles. Off-nadir imagery introduces a lower effec- tive resolution and is marked in urban settings by building “tilt” relative to on-nadir imagery.
