To fully understand and simulate how the Earth’s climate is changing, climate scientists need to understand end-to-end how energy is transferred into, within, and out of the Earth’s climate system at all wavelengths and time scales [ 23,15,22]. While much progress has been made towards closing this complete energy transfer “budget” since the development of weather satellites [ 6,25,23,22], one of the larger remaining sources of uncertainty is the net amount of latent heat exchange [ 22], which occurs when water either absorbs or releases energy to the surrounding environment as it changes phase between solid, liquid, and gas in various weather phenomena. However, uncertainty about the total amount of global atmospheric water at any given time remains because no single observing instrument can fully observe the distributions of each water phase over a large area at high temporal resolution. For example, infrared (IR) wavelengths measured by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI; [ 20]) on the geostationary GOES-16 satellite provide continuous observations with high spatial resolution over a large domain (e.g. Fig. 1a). However, ABI IR observations in cloudy or moist regions are mostly representative of emission from cloud tops or the middle troposphere due to absorption of IR radiation by water vapor and scattering by in-cloud hydrometeors. Since most latent heat exchange in precipitating clouds occurs within and below clouds, additional information provided by the longer, less scattered microwave (MW) wavelengths measured by the Global Precipitation Mission Microwave Imager (GMI; [ 7]), are needed to penetrate liquid water and ice clouds and retrieve precipitation structure [ 18].

MW data are much coarser, and there are very large gaps between the narrow data “swaths” due to the low-earth orbits of MW satellites (Fig. 1b). This means that a large portion of global atmospheric water is persistently unsampled, which negatively impacts a wide variety of climate and weather applications, including models, forecasts, and scientific understanding [18, 24, 22, 21, 19]. Scientific Goals and Impact. In this study, we seek to use Bayesian deep learning to create a new product of synthetic MW brightness temperatures (TBs) that combines both the high spatial and temporal resolutions of IR data and information of water distributions below cloud tops (Fig. 1c). Additionally, we seek to provide an estimate of the variance of predicted TB values at each pixel to help both scientists and downstream applications discern whether or not each predicted MW\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy data removed:\n\nTo fully understand and simulate how the Earth's climate is changing, climate scientists need to understand the end-to-end energy transfer into, within, and out of the Earth's climate system at all wavelengths and time scales. While significant progress has been made towards closing the complete energy transfer \"budget\" since the development of weather satellites, one of the larger remaining sources of uncertainty is the net amount of latent heat exchange. This occurs when water absorbs or releases energy to the surrounding environment as it changes phase between solid, liquid, and gas in various weather phenomena.\n\nHowever, uncertainty about the total amount of global atmospheric water at any given time remains because no single observing instrument can fully observe the distributions of each water phase over a large area at high temporal resolution. Infrared (IR) wavelengths measured by the Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) on the geostationary GOES-16 satellite provide continuous observations with high spatial resolution over a large domain. However, ABI IR observations in cloudy or moist regions are mostly representative of emission from cloud tops or the middle troposphere due to absorption of IR radiation by water vapor and scattering by in-cloud hydrometeors.\n\nSince most latent heat exchange in precipitating clouds occurs within and below clouds, additional information provided by the longer, less scattered microwave (MW) wavelengths measured by the Global Precipitation Mission Microwave Imager (GMI) is needed to penetrate liquid water and ice clouds and retrieve precipitation structure. However, the spatial resolutions of MW data are much coarser, and there are very large gaps between the narrow data \"swaths\" due to the low-earth orbits of MW satellites.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose using Bayesian deep learning to create a synthetic product of microwave data with the spatial and temporal resolution of IR data. This product will provide a large positive impact on many climate and weather applications. We demonstrate that Bayesian deep learning is a promising technique for creating and improving synthetic microwave data from infrared data. Our results show a mean absolute percentage error of 0.7% for 183 ±3 GHz microwave brightness temperature.\n\nBased on quantified uncertainty metrics, we find that more training data is needed to achieve improved performance at 166 GHz, 37 GHz, and 23 GHz. Analysis of the spatial distribution of uncertainty reveals that additional cloud data will provide the greatest increase in skill, which will potentially allow for the generation of many secondary products derived from microwave data in the future.\n\nOur approach involves collocating IR and microwave pixels that are sampled at the same place and time, training a 56-layer Bayesian ResNet with convolutional Flipout layers and the ELBO loss function, and outputting both microwave TBs and variance at IR resolutions. We also decompose the resulting variance into epistemic and aleatoric components. The resulting product will enable atmospheric scientists to learn more about our atmosphere and improve many models and forecasts."
