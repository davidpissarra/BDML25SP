Yet smart metering infrastructure has the potential to vastly reduce carbon emissions from the energy sector through improved operating efﬁciencies. We propose the application of a distributed machine learning setting known as federated learning for energy demand forecasting at various scales to make load prediction possible whilst retaining the privacy of consumers’ raw energy consumption data. 1 Motivation & Impact Smart meters are being deployed in many countries across the world for the purpose of optimising efﬁciency within electricity grids and giving consumers insight into their energy usage. The meters record energy consumption within a building directly from the electricity supply and periodically communicate this data to energy suppliers and other entities in the energy sector. Smart meter data contain an enormous amount of potential predictive power that will aid the transition from fossil fuel technologies to cleaner and renewable technologies [ 1]. However this high-resolution data is particularly sensitive as it can easily enable inference about household occupancy, lifestyle habits or even what and when speciﬁc appliances are being used in a household. A large contribution of renewables in the energy mix poses a signiﬁcant challenge for balancing supply and demand. If peak demand coincides with low wind/solar inputs, energy must be provided by reliable backup generation, such as idling gas turbines. Such solutions are very costly, both economically and environmentally and serve to discourage the installation of large amounts of renewable energy production. Reliable forecasting will provide opportunity for more efﬁcient optimisation of electricity grids to cope with varying energy demand. With a rapidly evolving global climate and swinging extremes of temperature, large heating and cooling loads will become a more signiﬁcant factor in energy demand proﬁles. Additionally, as other areas of our daily lives become decarbonised, loads from electric vehicles etc. will pose a strain on electricity grids. Accurate forecasting is important here to understand how demand is evolving with consumer behaviour change. Demand side response applications - those that actively or suggestively seek to reduce peak loads when necessary - can also beneﬁt from accurate realtime forecasting. Despite the beneﬁts for promoting a greener energy sector, smart meter installation in most countries is an opt-in process and levels of adoption of smart meters remains low. Data privacy and security concerns are among the most cited reasons consumers give for rejecting a smart meter installation [ 2]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.The reasons consumers give as privacy concerns with smart meters include government surveillance, energy companies selling data and illegal data acquisition/use [ 3]. Although smart meter privacy has been recognised as an important issue by researchers in both energy and computing for over a decade [4,5], tackling it from a privacy preserving machine learning perspective is a novel area of research. In this paper, we propose the use of a modern distributed machine learning setting known as federated learning to train accurate energy demand forecasting models that preserve the privacy of consumer energy consumption data to enable greater adoption of smart meters by privacy-concious consumers. 2 Traditional Energy Demand Forecasting Approaches Various models, both simple and complex have been applied to energy demand forecasting. Simple methods based on autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) models apply a mathematical operation to demand data formatted as a time series. These models assume the time series to be stationary and work well for producing short-term forecasts, yet poorly in the longer-term as they only account for recent past historical data. Regression methods such as linear regression model the relationship between input data and a target output. These models are simple to construct and have some level of interpretability. Artiﬁcial neural networks improve on these regression models as they transform the inputs in a non-linear fashion to make predictions. The most successful neural network architectures for forecasting are based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs), such as Long-Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). These architectures can learn what long and short term information to pay attention to during the training process. Recent surveys compare and contrast traditional and modern approaches to energy consumption forecasting and conclude that AI-based methods (such as those that utilise neural networks) offer the greatest predictive performance across all forecasting horizons [6, 7]. The key drawback to how all these methods have been applied in the energy demand forecasting literature at present is the need for data to be centralised. Clearly the privacy of consumer energy consumption data can easily be violated in such cases. 3 Proposed Privacy Preserving Energy Demand Forecasting Approach Federated learning [ 8] is a setting that allows for distributing the training of a machine learning model over many devices or clients without the necessity for clients to share their raw datasets. In a typical federated learning setup, a central entity orchestrates the training schedule.
