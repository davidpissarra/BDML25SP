Nev- ertheless, due to the exceptionally high computing cost required, this simulation- based approach can only be employed for a short period of time within a limited area. Despite the fact that machine learning can mitigate this problem, the related model uncertainties may make it less reliable. To address this, we developed a neural network (NN) model powered with evidential learning to assess the data and model uncertainties applied to satellite observation data. Our study focuses on estimating the rate at which small droplets (cloud droplets) collide and coalesce to become larger droplets (raindrops) – autoconversion rates – since this is one of the key processes in the precipitation formation of liquid clouds, hence crucial to better understanding cloud responses to anthropogenic aerosols. The results of estimating the autoconversion rates demonstrate that the model performs reason- ably well, with the inclusion of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty estimation, which improves the credibility of the model and provides useful insights for future improvement. 1 Introduction Future climate projections demand a deeper understanding of interactions between aerosols and clouds since they constitute the biggest uncertainty in estimating the radiative forcing of climate change [IPCC, 2021]. One way to reduce such uncertainties is to understand the interaction between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation processes. One of the high-resolution simulations that can be used to study these interactions is the ICON-LEM [Zängl et al., 2015, Dipankar et al., 2015, Heinze et al., 2017]. Nevertheless, due to the exceptionally high computing cost required, it can only be employed for a limited period and geographical area. While machine learning has the potential to address the challenges mentioned, it is important to note that predictions made by these models may be affected by noise and model inference error [Malinin, 2019]. The degree of uncertainty in a model depends on the machine learning algorithm and the availability of data. These model uncertainties might be more pronounced for climate forecasts, raising concerns about the model’s reliability. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: General framework. The aforementioned issues are addressed in this study by employing deep evidential regression [Amini et al., 2020, Meinert et al., 2023] and the massive collection of satellite data, providing long-term global spatial coverage up to several decades. We focus in particular on autoconversion rates estimation since this is one of the key processes in the precipitation formation of liquid clouds, hence crucial to better understanding cloud responses to anthropogenic aerosols and, ultimately, climate change. Our current work represents a continuation and enhancement of our previous research efforts. Our previous work [Novitasari et al., 2021] also considered the prediction of autoconversion rates from satellite data; however, it entailed a more complex approach involving a machine learning model with more features and higher number of trainable weights, resulting in increased computational costs compared to our work. Furthermore, our previous approach utilized a more complex simulator (COSP; Swales et al., 2018) to generate satellite-like data, while our current approach is more cost-effective and straightforward as we simply define the cloud-top information based on cloud optical thickness. Importantly, we have not quantitatively assess the inherent uncertainty in our previous findings. This work offers a computationally effective solution by employing the fewest features necessary and minimizing trainable weights while still obtaining accurate predictions of autoconversion rates. Additionally, deep evidential learning evaluates data and model uncertainties without the need for additional training or inference. 2 Proposed Approach We present a novel approach for direct autoconversion rate extraction from satellite observation, which includes the estimation of data and model uncertainties. The general framework, as illustrated in Figure 1, involves climate science-based steps for generating training and testing datasets, along with a machine learning framework incorporating uncertainty quantification methods, as elaborated in the following section. Datasets We use datasets from ICON-LEM output over Germany on 2 May 2013, where distinct cloud regimes occurred, allowing for the investigation of quite different elements of cloud formation and evolution [Heinze et al., 2017]. We study a time period of 09:55 UTC to 13:20 UTC. Our focus is on ICON-LEM with a 156 m resolution on the native ICON grid, then regridded to a regular 1 km resolution to match the resolution of MODIS. The autoconversion rates in our training and testing data were derived using the two-moment microphysical parameterization of Seifert and Beheng (2006). The autoconversion rates for cloud tops that simulate satellite data were determined by selecting rates where the cloud optical thickness (COT), calculated from top to bottom, exceeds 1.
