We propose a machine learning approach to the automated classification of snow depth measurements into a snow cover class and a class corresponding to everything else, which takes into account both the temporal context and the dependencies between snow depth and other sensor measurements. Through a series of experiments we demonstrate that our approach simplifies the detection of seasonal snowmelt and corresponding onset of plant growth, which we used to assess climate-change related phenological shifts in otherwise rather poorly monitored high alpine regions. 1 Introduction An excellent way to assess the effects of global warming on organisms is through phenology, which studies the timing and recurring patterns of natural events. Long-term studies have shown that the spring phenology of plants has advanced over the last decades [ 4,7,19,23,25,20]. These findings have led to the establishment of phenological monitoring networks, which are, however, mostly situated in areas below the treeline. Besides evidence from satellite observations [ 25], field evidence of phenological shifts in high alpine regions is scarce due to the high costs and the labor involved. In seasonally snow-covered regions, snowmelt and spring temperatures are the most significant phenological cues that initiate plant growth [ 6,8,9,22,26,12]. The length of the snow-covered season in the Eureopean Alps has receded in the 20thcentury with a significant shift in the timing of snowmelt, particularly below the treeline [ 10,18,21,24]. A good proxy for high alpine regions, demonstrating corresponding snowmelt trends, is the climatological station located at Weissfluhjoch (Alpine range in Switzerland) (2540 m a.s.l.) [ 17], which suggests that the advancement of snowmelt timing is most likely transferable to higher elevations as well. We propose to mitigate the lack of evidence above the treeline with the use of automated weather station (AWS) data from the Swiss Intercantonal Measurement and Information System (IMIS) [ 14]. IMIS employs ultrasonic sensors to measure snow height, which only measure the distance from the sensor to the underlying object, whether it is snow or vegetation. The previous attempts to disentangle snow measurements from the rest were based on thresholding [ 2], which is generally cumbersome to transfer to new stations, and random forests [ 3], which however cannot explicitly model the temporal Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.structure of the data, deemed important to judge whether the signal coming from the sensor shows snow or vegetation. In this work, we instead approach this binary classification problem using a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) [ 13] that explicitly accounts for the temporal relationships between different points in time series data. This accurate classification of snow height measurements allows us to track snowmelt and the start of plant growth over a climate relevant period (1998-2023), showing evidence of phenological shifts in high alpine regions â€“ an excellent indicator of climate change [7].
