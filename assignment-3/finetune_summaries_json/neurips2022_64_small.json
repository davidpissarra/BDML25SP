The success of numerical weather prediction (NWP) is measured by the improvement of forecasts for various physical fields such as temperature and pressure. Large biases however exist in the precipitation predictions. Pure deep learning based approaches lack the advancements acheived by NWP in the past two to three decades. Hybrid methodology using NWP outputs as inputs to the deep learning based refinement tool offer an attractive means taking advantage of both NWP and state of the art deep learning algorithms. Augmenting the output from a well-known NWP model: Coupled Forecast System ver.2 (CFSv2) with deep learning for the first time, we demonstrate a hybrid model capability ( DeepNWP ) which shows substantial skill improvements for short-range global precipitation at 1-, 2- and 3-days lead time. To achieve this hybridization, we address the sphericity of the global data by using modified DLWP-CS architecture which transforms all the fields to cubed-sphere projection. The dynamical model outputs corresponding to precipitation and surface temperature are ingested to a UNET for predicting the target ground truth precipitation. While the dynamical model CFSv2 shows Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.a bias in the range of +5 to +7 mm/day over land, the multivariate deep learning model reduces it to -1 to +1 mm/day over global land areas. We validate the results by taking examples from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane Ivan in 2004, Central European floods in 2010, China floods in 2010, India floods in 2005 and the Myanmar cyclone Nargis in 2008. 1 Introduction Precipitation forms an essential component of the hydrological cycle for the planet. The precipitation falling on land and oceans provides sustenance to the living beings and its accurate predictions can lead to tremendous societal benefits. At short-range time scales, i.e. of the order one to three days, the information of rain occurrence is helpful for various stakeholders. For example, ahead in time knowledge of precipitation can help better mitigate or manage the impacts of hurricanes, cyclones and floods. At present, most of the weather forecasting in the world is performed by the models which are known as dynamical models or numerical weather prediction (NWP) models ( 2). Past few decades have seen improvement in the skill of numerical weather predictions, particularly that of temperature and winds. However, when it comes to physical fields such as precipitation and soil moisture, there are large biases in the outputs of these models ( 27). Deep learning can be effectively used as a tool to correct the biases in NWP models ( 22). The ability of deep learning to unwrap nonlinear patterns in the data coupled with its success in the spatial tasks within the computer vision community makes it specially attractive for this task ( 15). There have been attempts to perform data-driven weather forecasting by various researchers in the past ( 13;23). They were however limited by (i) performing training on linear fields relative to precipitation such as geopotential height at 500 hPa; thus not effectively addressing the physical field of direct interest to the humans (3;4;5;20;25;26;32;33), (ii) their ability to address sphericity of the global data over Earth (1;3;5;10;17;20;21;21;25;26;29;31;36;18), (iii) performing their study only over a limited region; thus neglecting the global teleconnections ( 1;3;21;29;18), (iv) their framework not utilizing and building upwards on the advancements in NWP; and rather trying to achieve the results similar to NWP and not utlizing the advancements in NWP & deep learning to develop hybrid forecasting framework to enhance the skill of the existing systems (1; 3; 4; 5; 17; 20; 29; 32; 33; 36). 1.1 Our contributions Rather than using deep learning directly to forecast precipitation, we use a hybrid approach combining it with the traditional NWP.

Introduction:\nPrecipitation is a vital component of the hydrological cycle, providing sustenance to living beings and accurate predictions can lead to significant societal benefits. At short-range time scales (1-3 days), knowledge of rain occurrence is essential for various stakeholders, such as mitigating or managing the impacts of hurricanes, cyclones, and floods.\n\nCurrently, most weather forecasting is performed using dynamical models or NWP models, which have improved in skill over the past few decades, particularly for temperature and winds. However, large biases exist in the outputs of these models for physical fields like precipitation and soil moisture. Deep learning can be used to correct these biases in NWP models, leveraging its ability to unwrap nonlinear patterns in data and its success in spatial tasks.\n\nPrevious attempts at data-driven weather forecasting have been limited by several factors, including:\n\n* Focusing on linear fields relative to precipitation, such as geopotential height at 500 hPa, rather than the physical field of direct interest to humans.\n* Failing to address the sphericity of global data over Earth.\n* Performing studies only over limited regions, neglecting global teleconnections.\n* Not utilizing and building upon advancements in NWP, instead trying to achieve similar results without leveraging the strengths of both NWP and deep learning.\n\n1.1 Our contributions:\nWe propose a hybrid approach combining deep learning with traditional NWP, using the CFSv2 model as a starting point. This approach aims to enhance the skill of existing systems by leveraging the strengths of both NWP and deep learning."
