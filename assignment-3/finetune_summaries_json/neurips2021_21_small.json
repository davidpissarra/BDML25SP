When objects are rare, the problem is exacerbated further. This is true of assessments of energy infrastructure such as generation, transmission, and end-use consumption; key to electriﬁcation planning as well as for effective assessment of natural disaster impacts which are varying in frequency and intensity due to climate change. We propose an approach to domain adaptation that requires only unlabeled samples from the target domain and generates synthetic data to augment training data for targeted domain adaptation. This approach is shown to work consistently across four geographically diverse domains, improving object detection average precision by 15.7% on average for small sample sizes. 1 Introduction Developing effective climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies requires an accurate and up- to-date understanding of climate change drivers, especially anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) from the energy sector [ 1]. Energy systems, and the electricity sector in particular, are changing rapidly: increasing renewable energy globally [ 2], in particular, the rise of many forms of distributed energy, and grid expansion in Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of southeast Asia [ 3]. Understanding these developments and their GHG implications in near real-time is important for establishing realistic strategies and policies for addressing climate change impacts. However, these important energy systems data are often challenging to obtain and keep up-to-date, and vary in availability from region-to-region. One potential solution to this limitation is to use remote sensing data, and numerous studies have demonstrated that computer vision techniques, such as object detection and image segmentation are capable of accurately detecting energy infrastructure in remotely sensed data [ 4,5,6]. These techniques have been shown to work well in situations when the training data are very representative of the validation data. In real applications of these techniques, we often do not have labeled training data for the region to which we wish to apply our models: in such cases, we need to adapt our approach to the new domain (i.e. domain adaptation or shift). Recent evidence on domain adaptation [ 7,8,9] suggests that deep learning models do not generalize well to imagery from new geographic locations. This problem arises due to the visual variability of overhead imagery due to atmospheric conditions, sensor characteristics, regional ﬂora, and differences in the built environment. Some of these differences may cause the model to generalize unpredictably, often very poorly [9]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: Real imagery source locations, geographic domains, and examples from each geographic domain. While there has been some progress on domain adaptation for deep learning [ 10,11], this remains challenging especially for large train/test data domain gaps [ 12] and we remain far from being able to train a model once with limited training data and apply it globally, a major hindrance for autonomous mapping. Recent work on synthetic imagery generation for training augmentation for rare objects offers a potential solution [ 9,13,14,15]. These works showed that synthetic training imagery could supplement training sets, resulting in performance improvements. In this work we build upon the recent SIMPL method [ 14] because it is replicable, easily adapted to new problems, and designed for object detection problems. In this work, we adapt their approach for geographic domain adaptation, and demonstrate its effectiveness for mapping energy infrastructure in satellite imagery across substantially larger, and more diverse, geographies. The contributions of this paper are three-fold: (1) we created an overhead imagery dataset with labeled wind turbines from four carefully selected geographies for evaluating domain adaptation effectiveness; (2) the dataset includes training augmentation imagery with synthetic wind turbine objects using unlabeled data from target domains; (3) we evaluated performance on held-out data for all combinations of domains and demonstrate efﬁcacy of the technique. 2 Methodology This work focuses on object detection of wind turbines. While we could demonstrate this process for any type of energy infrastructure, we use wind turbines because, aside from size differences, they are relatively homogeneous in appearance, to reduce the number of variables for which we need to control. To investigate the use of synthetically generated imagery for domain adaptation for wind turbines, we will ﬁrst create a baseline dataset of real wind turbines. Then, to create the synthetic imagery, we use imagery from the same dataset without wind turbines and augment it with synthetic wind turbine objects. Lastly, we will train object detection models to evaluate their performance across domains. 2.1 Dataset creation We ﬁrst created the real imagery dataset by sampling from the National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP[ 16]) dataset, which is 0.6 m/pixel resolution across the U.S. We samples from 4 geographic regions (i.e. domains) that we called Northwest (NW), Northeast (NE), Eastern Midwest (EM), and Southwest (SW), chosen to vary in the visual appearance (Figure 1).
