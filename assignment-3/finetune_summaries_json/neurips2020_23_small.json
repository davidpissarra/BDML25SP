However, they are cur- rently under threat from anthropogenic activities, so monitoring their health, extent, and productivity is vital to our ability to protect these important ecosystems. Tra- ditionally, lower resolution satellite imagery or high resolution unmanned air vehicle (UA V) imagery has been used independently to monitor mangrove ex- tent, both offering helpful features to predict mangrove extent. To take advantage of both of these data sources, we propose the use of a hybrid neural network, which combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extractor with a Multilayer-Perceptron (MLP), to accurately detect mangrove areas using both medium resolution satellite and high resolution drone imagery. We present a com- parison of our novel Hybrid CNN with algorithms previously applied to mangrove image classiﬁcation on a data set we collected of dwarf mangroves from consumer UA Vs in Baja California Sur, Mexico, and show a 95% intersection over union (IOU) score for mangrove image classiﬁcation, outperforming all our baselines. 1 Introduction Mangrove forests are coastal ecosystems that are highly effective at inhibiting the causes of climate change through carbon sequestration, storing approximately twice as much carbon per cubic meter in their biomass as that of tropical rainforests [20], and 14% of \"blue carbon\" in our oceans [14]. Therefore, mangrove forests prove to be useful tools for national governments to reduce their individual contributions to global climate change, as over 45 countries speciﬁcally mention mangroves in their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) towards meeting the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement [15]. These forests not only help prevent the causes of climate change, but are key in mitigating climate change impacts. Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of tropical storms [12], leading to larger storm surges [10] and higher levels of coastal erosion [16]. Mangroves act as natural storms breaks that mitigate the physical impact of tropical storms on communities near mangrove forests by reducing erosion through lessening wave energy [4]. Because of this, mangrove forests serve as an important resource for local decision makers to protect their constituents. The ecosystem services of mangroves forests are estimated to provide 33-57 thousand USD per hectare per year to associated local economies. Despite the beneﬁts that mangroves provide, they are at risk due to human activity, declining at a rate of 2% per year [19] and could release an estimated 4.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere if deforestation continues at current rates [6]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Therefore, such deforestation impacts not only affects global climate, but regional economies, so [17] tracking extent and associated ecosystem services of mangroves an important metric to measuring their economic and societal value. Many previous methods developed to track the extent mangrove ecosystems utilize single sources of data of lower resolution, with algorithms developed for predictions dependent on hyperspectral bands [9] or vegetation indices [21]. Most notably, Global Mangrove Watch (GMW) utilizes ALOS PALSAR and Landsat Satellite Imagery to estimate global coverage of mangroves at a 25m resolution with a variant of Random Forest, the Extremely Randomized Tree classiﬁer trained from 53,878 manually labeled points [2]. These prediction maps can be useful for global and national decision makers; but predictions from GMW are lower resolution and temporally sparse with the most recent predictions created in 2016, leaving many local decision makers with outdated and imprecise statistics. On the other hand, to avoid the lower resolution and temporal frequency that satellite images provide, remote sensing using consumer UA Vs has emerged, allowing remote sensing scientists to resolve details in imagery not visible from satellites, and record these images more frequently. Although these methods require in-situ surveys, UA Vs show a large amount of promise for ecology and remote sensing tasks [13] such as crop monitoring [1] and forest management [5]. UA Vs have even been used to record high resolution images to measure mangrove extent, but are often dependent on expensive hyperspectral sensors [3] to achieve high performance using images sourced from UA Vs alone. To further aid in the conservation of mangrove forests, we aim to combine the advantages of satellite and UA V remote sensing to create more accurate mangrove extent maps. In this paper, we propose a novel Hybrid CNN deep learning network that can be used to measure the extent of mangroves using a combination of medium resolution 4-band Planetscope satellite and UA V imagery. We also describe methods used to acquire our dataset of mangrove imagery and labels and compare our mangrove classiﬁcation network to baseline models and labels from previous related works. Lastly, we provide pathways for future development for the remote sensing of mangrove ecosystems to aid in the ﬁght against climate change. \".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
