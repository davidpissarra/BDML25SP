In this work, we propose a novel approach for automated detection of human-induced changes in woodlands using Echo State Networks (ESNs) and satellite imagery. Using ESNs offers a promising solution for analyzing time-series data and identifying deviations indicative of forest alterations, particularly those caused by human activities such as deforestation and logging. The proposed experimental setup leverages satellite im- agery to capture temporal variations in the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and involves the training and evaluation of ESN models using extensive datasets from Chile’s central region, encompassing diverse woodland environments and human-induced disturbances. Our initial experiments demonstrate the effec- tiveness of ESNs in predicting NDVI values and detecting deviations indicative of human-related changes in woodlands, even in the presence of climate-induced changes like drought and browning. Our work contributes to forest monitoring by offering a scalable and efficient solution for automated change detection in woodland environments. Integrating ESNs with satellite imagery analysis provides valuable insights into human impacts on forest ecosystems, facilitating informed decision-making for sustainable land management and biodiversity conservation. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.1 Introduction Monitoring forest ecosystems is crucial for addressing global change and mitigating ecosystem degradation, as forests provide essential services such as water and carbon regulation, nutrient cycling, air purification, biodiversity conservation, climate moderation, and recreational opportunities (16;19;20;2;4;7;32). Deforestation, driven by urbanization and agricultural expansion, leads to the destruction and fragmentation of habitats, disrupting vital ecological functions and threatening biodiversity and sustainable land management ( 29;5;18;45). While the Amazon rainforest has garnered significant attention, forests worldwide hold immense ecological, economic, and societal value (35; 27; 10). Natural disturbances such as fires and droughts also contribute to forest degradation, making it challenging to differentiate between deforestation and other forms of degradation ( 9;26;36;33). Effective landscape management and policy-making require robust monitoring systems that can accurately detect these changes on a large scale, for which remote sensing provides a powerful tool. The time series analysis of optical satellite imagery, combined with machine learning and statistical techniques, has proven effective in detecting landscape changes ( 38;25;17;44). Notable examples include the Continuous Change Detection and Classification algorithm (CCDC) and Breaks for Additive Season and Trend (BFAST) ( 46;43;24). Deep learning methods have further enhanced our ability to analyze complex, multi-dimensional remote sensing data, with CNNs and RNNs particularly successful in this domain (39; 34; 6). However, the scalability of CNNs and RNNs remains challenging, particularly regarding compu- tational demands and data requirements ( 15). Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), despite their ability to model long-term temporal dependencies, face difficulties when adapting to changes in data distribution, a critical factor in dynamic environments like forests ( 23;37;11). In this context, Echo State Networks (ESNs), a type of RNN, offer significant advantages. ESNs can efficiently adapt to new data and predict chaotic time dynamics. Their training process is faster and less prone to the gradient problem compared to other RNNs, as only the readout layer is trained ( 13;14;21;22;28). ESNs have been successfully applied in various domains, such as fault detection in industrial systems, yet their application in forest change detection remains underexplored (3; 30). Our research addresses this gap by developing an ESN-based system for detecting large-scale forest changes, explicitly focusing on central Chile. This region has experienced severe droughts and fires over the past decade, leading to significant tree mortality in a highly heterogeneous landscape of forestry and agricultural mosaics, making it an ideal testing ground for this approach (9; 26). 2 Methods 2.1 Data selection, processing, and training The study area covers approximately 78,000 km2in central Chile (latitudes from -36.5 °S to -32.2 ºS), a region recognized as one of the global biodiversity hotspots ( 27). Local forests are confronted with anthropogenic pressures such as urbanization, agricultural encroachment, and the introduction of non- native plant species. In the last decade, the region has experienced extreme drought conditions that cause widespread \"browning\" phenomena ( 9;26), and intense wildfire activity, further exacerbating the stress on these vital ecosystems (36). Our analysis is based on a Landsat multispectral dataset comprising 8,804 scenes captured between January 2000 and June 2022 with the TM, ETM +, and OLI/TIRS sensors aboard Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 satellites ( 41).
