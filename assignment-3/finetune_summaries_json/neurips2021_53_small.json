We introduce PREDISMthat employs an ensemble of ResNets and fully connected layers over decision trees to capture image-level and meta-level information to accurately estimate weakness of man-made structures to disaster-occurrences. Our model performs well and is responsive to tuning across types of disasters and highlights the space of preemptive hazard damage modelling. 1 Introduction 1.1 Natural Hazard Threats and Climate Risk Natural hazards have been humanity’s threats throughout the world over the years, and such threats would worsen as the climate changes (Tippett, 2018). Speciﬁcally, sea-level rise could amplify ﬂooding threats and leave low-elevated coastal regions under sea-level permanently (Marsooli et al., 2019; Miura et al., 2021b); warm and dry conditions cause severe and vast wildﬁres, and such ﬁres could frequently occur as global warming extends ﬁre seasons in the future (Halofsky et al., 2020); more extreme rainfalls are expected due to warming climate (Knutson et al., 2015) and the slow-downed tropical cyclones which are also caused by global warming (Kossin, 2018). These threats are some of the many outcomes of changing climate. The regions with little or no hazard occurrences in the past may be devastated by ampliﬁed hazards (Miura et al., 2021a). Such natural hazards affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars (He and Cha, 2018; Kreibich et al., 2019). Given the limited resources, it is critical to predict and prepare effectively for future hazards in order to mitigate their threats (Miura et al., 2021c). Understanding the nature of threats (i.e., magnitude, frequency) could allow proper preparedness and a quicker recovery. For example, stakeholders and communities could implement a proper protective measure (e.g., barriers) or strategy (e.g., evacuation plan, insurance) against future hazards. 1.2 Hazard Damage Studies with Machine Learning The machine-learning community has been very interested in disaster damage domain in the context of climate change. For example, Crisis-DIAS from Agarwal et al. (2020) uses multi-modal platforms to consolidate post-disaster damage-levels across information sources, while Zhang et al. (2020) discusses human-in-loop entities to accurately estimate post-disaster damages. The work in Chen 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.(2020) explores convolution neural networks (CNNs) and hyper-parameters to merge pre-disaster and post-disaster images together for the same. Unlike most previous studies that use machine learning in the space of building damage and climate change (Agarwal et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Chen, 2020), which focus on after-the-fact damage estimation of a natural hazard occurrence, we introduce PREDISM, which models susceptibility of buildings, landscapes, and habitats for a future calamity. Forecasting the future risks allows residents and governments to take stock of situations with an appropriate contingency fund, facilities, and preparedness. PREDISMdoesn’t depend on disaster occurrence, rather it predicts damages that could happen from a future hazard with a given intensity. This is highly beneﬁcial to affected communities if the future hazard risk, given the climate risk, could be identiﬁed without the massive past data but with the current community’s information (e.g., present satellite imagery over the area). For instance, identifying building damage levels prior to a hazard of an arbitrary magnitude hitting the area would provide an insight to the stakeholders and communities. Our models are ﬁne-tuned on disaster-type open-source building datasets (Gupta et al., 2019), along with adjoining unifying fully connected layers activated with meta-information to generate building-level hazard-level risks of future damage. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data Schema We use the xBD dataset from Gupta et al. (2019) that serve as the basis of ﬁne-tuning our ensemble model. The xBD data is spread across ﬁfteen countries and 45,361 square kilometers that equate to 850,736 individual buildings’ data. The 30 GB of data is manually appended by quite a few meta-information (additional details in Appendix). Additional information is gleaned for xBD building images that include damage-levels incurred on past occurrences serving the purpose of training our model ensemble predictor. Each damage-level is classiﬁed into one of \"unclassiﬁed\", \"no damage\", \"minor damage\", \"major damage\", or \"destroyed\".

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nCrucial space is created by predicting building-level damages before they occur, allowing state actors and non-governmental organizations to distribute resources effectively and minimize or prevent losses. We introduce PREDISM, an ensemble model that combines ResNets and fully connected layers over decision trees to capture image-level and meta-level information, accurately estimating the vulnerability of man-made structures to disaster occurrences. Our model performs well and is responsive to tuning across various disaster types, highlighting the potential for preemptive hazard damage modeling.\n\n1 Introduction\n\n1.1 Natural Hazard Threats and Climate Risk\n\nNatural hazards have posed a threat to humanity worldwide for years, and this threat is expected to worsen as the climate changes (Tippett, 2018). Specifically, sea-level rise could amplify flooding threats, leaving low-elevated coastal regions at risk of permanent flooding (Marsooli et al., 2019; Miura et al., 2021b). Warm and dry conditions can cause severe and widespread wildfires, which could become more frequent as global warming extends fire seasons in the future (Halofsky et al., 2020). More extreme rainfalls are expected due to a warming climate (Knutson et al., 2015), and the slowing of tropical cyclones, also caused by global warming (Kossin, 2018). These threats are among the many outcomes of climate change. Regions with little or no hazard occurrences in the past may be devastated by amplified hazards (Miura et al., 2021a). Such natural hazards affect millions of people and cost billions of dollars (He and Cha, 2018; Kreibich et al., 2019). Given limited resources, it is critical to predict and prepare effectively for future hazards to mitigate their threats (Miura et al., 2021c). Understanding the nature of threats (i.e., magnitude, frequency) can allow for proper preparedness and a quicker recovery. For example, stakeholders and communities can implement protective measures (e.g., barriers) or strategies (e.g., evacuation plans, insurance) against future hazards.\n\n1.2 Hazard Damage Studies with Machine Learning\n\nThe machine learning community has been interested in the disaster damage domain in the context of climate change. For example, Crisis-DIAS from Agarwal et al. (2020) uses multi-modal platforms to consolidate post-disaster damage levels across information sources, while Zhang et al. (2020) discusses human-in-loop entities to accurately estimate post-disaster damages. Chen et al.

For instance, identifying building damage levels prior to a hazard of an arbitrary magnitude hitting the area would provide insight to stakeholders and communities.\n\nOur models are fine-tuned on disaster-type open-source building datasets (Gupta et al., 2019), along with adjoining fully connected layers activated with meta-information to generate building-level hazard-level risks of future damage.\n\n2 Methodology\n\n2.1 Data Schema\n\nWe use the xBD dataset from Gupta et al. (2019) as the basis for fine-tuning our ensemble model. The xBD data spans 15 countries and 45,361 square kilometers, covering 850,736 individual buildings' data. The 30 GB of data is manually appended with additional meta-information (see Appendix). We also gather information for xBD building images that include damage levels incurred on past occurrences to train our model ensemble predictor. Each damage level is classified into one of \"unclassified,\" \"no damage,\" \"minor damage,\" \"major damage,\" or \"destroyed.\" During inference using PREDISM, when sufficient information is available, the model can predict building-level hazard risks."
