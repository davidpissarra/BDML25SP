Instead, we focus on geomet- ric deep learning using graph neural networks, aiming to build a spatio-temporal graph neural network that learns from thickness information of the top ice layers and predicts for deeper layers. In this paper, we developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that used the GraphSAGE framework for spatio features learning and a temporal convolution operation to capture temporal changes, enabling different branches of the network to be more specialized and focusing on a single learning task. We found that our proposed multi-branch net- work can consistently outperform the current fused spatio-temporal graph neural network in both accuracy and efficiency. 1 Introduction As global temperatures continue to rise, research has shown that the accelerated mass loss of polar ice sheets is increasingly contributing to climate change[ 2,8,11,21]. Polar ice sheets comprise several internal ice layers formed in different years. A better understanding of the status of internal ice layers can provide valuable information on snowfall melting and accumulation and enable a comprehensive understanding of the global climate system and future climate change. Traditional methods to study the internal ice layer are through onsite ice core[ 9]. However, the limited and discrete coverage makes it impossible to study the continuous change of the ice layer. Additionally, onside ice cores are expensive to obtain and will cause destructive damage to the ice sheet. In recent years, airborne snow radar sensors have proven to be a more effective way to study ice layers. Internal layers with different depths are captured continuously as radargrams by measuring the reflected signal strength[1], shown in Figure1( a). ∗Corresponding Author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.With the development of deep learning techniques, various convolution-based neural networks[ 10,13– 15] have been proposed to extract ice layer boundaries from radargrams. However, noise in the radargrams is shown to be a major obstacle to achieve high-quality results. Instead of the convolution- based neural networks, Zalatan et al.[ 17–19] focus on learning the relationship between ice layers formed in different years and graph neural network. They utilized a fused spatio-temporal graph neural network, AGCN-LSTM, and aimed to make predictions on the thickness of deeper ice layers based on the thickness information of shallow layers. In their network, graph convolutional network(GCN) for spatio features is fused into the long short-term memory(LSTM) structure for temporal changes. Although their proposed methods have decent performance in predicting ice thickness, training the fused spatio-temporal graph neural network usually takes a few hours due to high computational costs. In this paper, we aim to build upon the work of Zalatan et al.[ 17–19] by improving the network performance in both accuracy and efficiency. Our major contributions are: 1) We developed a novel multi-branch spatio-temporal graph neural network that uses the GraphSAGE framework for spatio feature learning and uses temporal convolution operation to learn temporal changes, making different parts of the network more specialized to one single learning task. 2) We conducted extensive experiments on comparison with fused spatio-temporal graph neural networks, and results show that our proposed network can consistently outperform other methods in efficiency and accuracy. 2 From Radargram To Graph Dataset In this work, we will start with radargrams captured over the Greenland Region in 2012 via airborne snow radar sensor operated by CReSIS[ 4]. Each radargram varies from 1200 pixels to 1700 pixels in depth, with a fixed 256 pixels in width. The value of each pixel is determined by the reflected signal strength, where brighter pixels in the radargram mean a stronger reflection[ 1], shown in Figure 1( a). Based on radargrams, corresponding labeled images are generated manually by NASA scientists by tracking out each layer, as illustrated in Figure Figure 1( b). Based on the position of ice layer boundary pixels, layer thickness can be calculated as the difference between its upper and lower boundaries. Moreover, while capturing the radargrams, airborne snow radar sensors will also keep records of current latitude and longitude simultaneously. Our graph dataset is then generated on the thickness and geographical location information from the radargrams and labeled images with additional pre-processing steps. As shown in Figure 1( b), we will use the top five layers (formed in 2007-2011) to predict the thickness of the deeper ice layers (formed in 1992-2006). To ensure the high quality of our graph dataset, we will eliminate images with less than 20 complete layers, dividing the remaining images into training, testing, and validation sets with a ratio of 3 : 1 : 1. This pre-processing step reduces the total number of valid images to 1660. Each valid labeled image will be represented as two temporal sequences of spatial graphs:\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
