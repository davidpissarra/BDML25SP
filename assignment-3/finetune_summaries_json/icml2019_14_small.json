Though TCs have been studied from many different angles, more work is needed from a statistical approach of provid- ing prediction regions (Camargo & Wing, 2016). The cur- rent state-of-the-art in TC prediction bands comes from the National Hurricane Center at National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOOA), whose proprietary model provides “cones of uncertainty” for TCs through an analysis of historical forecast errors (NOAA/NHC, 2018). The contribution of this paper is twofold. We introduce a new pipeline that encourages transparent and adaptable prediction band development by streamlining cyclone track simulation and prediction band generation. We also provide updates to existing models and novel statistical methodolo- gies in both areas of the pipeline respectively. Our pipeline has many desirable properties. It provides an easy-to-use framework to estimate prediction bands for new TCs. The pipeline consists of two separable components for TC track simulation and prediction band creation. Each individual part is designed to be interchangeable ; provided the input and output are the same, each part can easily be replaced by the user’s favorite method. We provide purely data driven TC simulation approaches, but one can easily pair these with other meteorological methods. This is especially important in a climate change scenario, where TC behavior might change drastically in a relatively short period of time. Our current pipeline is implemented as an R package and is available on Github1.

We extend the current statistical methods for TC simulations, combining autoregressive path prediction models (Vickery et al., 2000) and models of TC lifespan (Hall & Jewson, 2007). We propose novel statistically valid prediction bands by leveraging geometric properties and statistical notions on the depth and centrality of simulated curves. We benchmark against the prediction bands creation technique found in NOOA’s state-of-the-art model (NOAA/NHC, 2018). We construct prediction band methods that provide coverage in either a pointwise or uniform manner, i.e., aiming to cover either the future measurements of the TC path or the full TC track respectively. Section 3 discusses these contributions in detail, highlights experimental results on held-out data, and provides empirical assessments of the prediction band methods’ statistical properties. 2. Pipeline Structure and Flow Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of our pro- posed pipeline. The leftmost stage corresponds to the input, which is a series of spatiotemporal measurements of a TC track. In the current iteration we rely on the Atlantic Oceano- graphic and Meteorological Laboratory of NOAA, which publicly shares data on TC paths in the North Atlantic (Land- sea & Franklin, 2013; NOAA/AOML, 2017); each path has information on time, latitude and longitude, recorded ev- ery six hours until the storm dies. For each new TC, the pipeline uses only a few initial points to simulate a series of tracks the TC could traverse. The curve simulation models are tuned according to the computational complexity of the models and the available processing power. When training the track simulation model, the training TC paths should be representative of the world region for which the pipeline will make predictions. For instance, TC track data over the Atlantic Ocean should not be used to train models over the Paciﬁc Ocean. Once these simulations are generated, the next stage uses this ensemble to produce a prediction band at a chosen statistical conﬁdence level, usually between 90% and99%. The conﬁdence refers to the statistical coverage of the prediction band, i.e., the rate at which the prediction band covers the true TC points or the full TC track. When considering different prediction band techniques, one could use a held-out set of TC tracks to assess the performance,A Flexible Pipeline for Data-Driven Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Paths Generate SimulationsCreate  Prediction BandsNew Tropical CyloneGenerative  ModelsTraining  Tropical Cylones Figure 1.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe proposed pipeline can help mitigate human and property losses caused by tropical cyclones (TCs). Despite extensive research on TCs from various angles, more work is needed to improve prediction accuracy. The current state-of-the-art in TC prediction bands comes from the National Hurricane Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides \"cones of uncertainty\" for TCs through historical forecast error analysis (NOAA/NHC, 2018). This paper contributes to the field in two ways. First, we introduce a new pipeline that streamlines TC track simulation and prediction band generation, making it more transparent and adaptable. Second, we provide updates to existing models and novel statistical methodologies in both areas of the pipeline.\n\nOur pipeline has several desirable properties. It provides an easy-to-use framework for estimating prediction bands for new TCs. The pipeline consists of two separable components: TC track simulation and prediction band creation. Each component is designed to be interchangeable, allowing users to replace them with their preferred methods, provided the input and output are the same. We provide data-driven TC simulation approaches, but users can easily pair these with other meteorological methods, which is crucial in a climate change scenario where TC behavior may change drastically in a short period.\n\nOur current pipeline is implemented as an R package and is available on GitHub.
