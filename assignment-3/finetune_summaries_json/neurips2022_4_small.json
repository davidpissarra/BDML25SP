We often have to settle for less informative vertically aggregated proxies such as aerosol optical depth (AOD). In this work, we develop a framework to infer vertical aerosol profiles using AOD and readily available vertically resolved meteorological predictors such as temperature or relative humidity. We devise a simple Gaussian process prior over aerosol vertical profiles and update it with AOD observations. We validate our approach using ECHAM-HAM aerosol-climate model data. Our results show that, while simple, our model is able to reconstruct realistic extinction profiles with well-calibrated uncertainty. In particular, the model demonstrates a faithful recon- struction of extinction patterns arising from aerosol water uptake in the boundary layer. 1 Introduction Aerosols are microscopic particles suspended in the atmosphere such as dust, sea salt or black carbon. They influence the Earth’s energy budget with a negative radiative forcing that counteracts the global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gases emissions. A large fraction of this forcing is due to their modulation of radiative properties of clouds. By acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), aerosols can drive up the cloud droplet number while driving down the mean cloud droplet size. The resulting clouds are brighter, larger and last longer [ 1,20]. They hence reflect more solar radiation and cool the Earth. However, the magnitude of this forcing is difficult to estimate [ 9] in part because the physical processes underpinning aerosol-cloud interactions are not yet fully understood. To better estimate present day forcing we require accurate, global measurements of CCN concentrations to assess radiative properties of clouds [ 1,20]. Unfortunately, measuring CCN concentrations can only be achieved in-situ, and while field campaigns have already undertaken to collect detailed CCN observations, these measurements are spatio-temporally sparse and provide insufficient constraint on global distribution of aerosols [2, 15]. For lack of better observations, the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) has been widely adopted as a first order proxy of CCN concentration in an atmospheric column [ 2,4,12]. The AOD is a measure of the extinction of solar radiations through an atmospheric column. It is denoted by τand defined at Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.a given wavelength, time, latitude and longitude by τ=RH 0bext(h) dh, where bextis the extinction coefficient1and the integral is taken over the height Hof an atmospheric column. The AOD is appealing because it is routinely observed on a global scale by satellite products [ 14] which, as opposed to in situ observations, offer long term global records. However, the AOD is a column-integrated quantity and does not provide information on the vertical distribution of aerosols. This is limiting since their vertical distribution strongly influences both the magnitude and the sign of the forcing. Stier [18] highlights the importance of determining aerosol vertical distributions to provide stronger constraints on CCN at specific altitudes. In particular, the AOD fails to describe near-surface properties such as the concentration of aerosols in the lowest part of the atmosphere, called the boundary layer. In this work, we propose to probe whether AOD observations can be used to constrain a global prior over aerosol vertical distributions. Formally, given an AOD observation τ, we want to reconstruct the corresponding extinction coefficient profile bext. Using Gaussian processes (GPs) [ 13], we design a Bayesian model that maps vertically-resolved meteorological variables that are readily available (e.g. temperature, relative humidity) to a probabilistic estimate of bext. This probabilistic estimates then integrates into the AOD. The model formulation is simple and makes assumptions explicit, hence granting control and interpretability over predictions while offering built-in uncertainty quantification. We use ECHAM-HAM global aerosol-climate model simulation data [ 16,17,23] to validate our approach. While our prime motivation is to reconstruct bextfrom satellite observations of AOD, the intricacies of combining measurements from different instruments makes it challenging to validate any proposed methodology. On the other hand, ECHAM-HAM is a self-consistent climate model that offers readily available aerosol vertical profiles, and is better suited for model development. We demonstrate our model is able to reconstruct natural patterns that arise in aerosol vertical distribution, in particular in the boundary layer. We show that very simple and readily available meteorological predictors suffice to obtain a good estimation of the extinction coefficient. 2 Model Design 2.1 Design of the prior In passive satellite sensors, AOD retrieval algorithms assume a form for vertical profiles, which in the simplest case takes the exponential form bext(h)∝e−h/L[8,22].Lis a fixed height scale parameter that is typically taken as the top altitude of the boundary layer ( ≈2km). These profiles capture a key element of aerosol vertical distribution: most CCN lies at low altitude in the boundary layer.
