Due to the warmer and drier conditions created by climate change, more severe and uncontrollable wildfires are expected to occur in the coming years. This could lead to a global wildfire crisis and have dire consequences on our planet. Hence, it has become imperative to use technology to help prevent the spread of wildfires. One way to prevent the spread of wildfires before they become too large is to perform early detection i.e, detecting the smoke before the actual fire starts. In this paper, we present our Wildfire Detection and Alert System which use machine learning to detect wildfire smoke with a high degree of accuracy and can send immediate alerts to users. Our technology is currently being used in the USA to monitor data coming in from hundreds of cameras daily. We show that our system has a high true detection rate and a low false detection rate. Our performance evaluation study also shows that on an average our system detects wildfire smoke faster than an actual person. 1 Introduction Every year, wildfires burn down millions of acres of land, damage thousands of structures and they also cause severe air pollution. Wildfires are disastrous to both human communities and wildlife. They cause billions of dollars in damages every year. In 2021 alone, there were over 58 thousand fires in the USA which burned down 7.13 million acres of land. Due to the global warming caused by climate change [ 1,2], warmer and drier conditions are being created. Warmer temperatures cause greater evaporation which leads to drier soils and vegetation which makes them more susceptible to burning and can lead to severe wildfires. Studies have shown that in the coming decades, there is going to be a global increase in large and severe wildfires due to the adverse effects of climate change [3,4,5]. Wildfires are already extremely difficult to control and mitigate and if their severity keeps worsening over the years like the studies have shown then it would have dire consequences on our planet. Over the years, technology has been used to analyze different aspects of wildfires like - Fire Spread Simulators [ 6,7] and Detecting Wildfires from Satellite Data [ 8,9]. There are also many different ∗Equal Contribution †Corresponding author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022Figure 1: Overview of our Wildfire Detection and Alert System fire management tools available online. While these technological tools are helpful in analyzing and mitigating the spread of wildfires, they don’t help much in early detection and prevention of wildfires. Cameras providing real-time image feed have been used for quite some time by human operators to monitor and identify wildfires. However, it is not possible for humans to monitor such data accurately around the clock. Machine learning (ML) algorithms are much more efficient for such real-time image based data. Such ML algorithms can perform early detection of wildfires i.e, detecting the smoke before the actual fire starts [ 10]. While there are many early detection products in the market, many of them require specialized hardware, have limited coverage, and have a high false detection rate. We present our Wildfire Detection System in this paper which has a high true detection rate, low false detection rate and which only uses real-time camera data to perform early detection of the wildfire smoke (Fig 1). The human operator now only has to confirm the detection alert instead of monitoring the cameras all the time. Once the alert is confirmed, authorities can reach the scene and prevent the wildfire smoke from turning into a large, uncontrollable wildfire. Our system is currently being actively used in the USA and monitors near real-time data from hundreds of cameras daily. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data There are no good publicly available labeled datasets which can be used for early detection of wildfires. So we gathered raw image data from Alert Wildfire Cameras [ 11]. Alert Wildfire is an association which provides open access to fire spotting cameras placed in different parts of the USA. These cameras are widely used by firefighters and first responders. We gathered data from 400 different cameras. These cameras cover many different terrains and the data was collected every month from Jun’21 - Mar’22. Therefore, the dataset is rich and diverse. The final dataset consists of 90,000 images. We then labeled the images with bounding boxes and categorized the images as wildire and non-wildfire images. More details on the dataset can be found in Appendix A.1. 2.2 Model Architecture The main challenge with smoke detection is that smoke can be of varying scales. Therefore, our model architecture is specifically designed to extract relevant information at different scales. To do this, we use an architecture similar to the one used in FCOS [ 12]. An overview of our architecture can be seen in Fig 2. As our detection system gets near real-time data from multiple cameras, we needed a backbone network which is relatively lightweight and fast. That’s why we chose ResNet-18 [13\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Wildfires are disastrous for both human communities and wildlife, resulting in billions of dollars in damages annually. In 2021, there were over 58,000 fires in the USA, burning down 7.13 million acres of land. Climate change, caused by global warming, creates warmer and drier conditions, making soils and vegetation more susceptible to burning and leading to severe wildfires. Studies predict a global increase in large and severe wildfires due to climate change. Wildfires are already difficult to control and mitigate, and if their severity worsens, it will have dire consequences for the planet.\n\nOver the years, technology has been used to analyze various aspects of wildfires, including fire spread simulators and detecting wildfires from satellite data.
