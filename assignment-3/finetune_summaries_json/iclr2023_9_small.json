That is, it estimates the potential solar energy (and associ- ated ﬁnancial savings) that can be captured by buildings if solar panels were to be installed on their roofs. Unfortunately its coverage is limited by the lack of high resolution digital surface map (DSM) data. We present a deep learning ap- proach that bridges this gap by enhancing widely available low-resolution data, thereby dramatically increasing the coverage of Sunroof. We also present some ongoing efforts to potentially improve accuracy even further by replacing certain algorithmic components of Sunroof’s processing pipeline with deep learning. 1 I NTRODUCTION Figure 1: Low quality, sub-meter, imagery and its corresponding digital surface map are shown on the left (RGB SMand DSM SM). High quality, centimeter-scale, of the same area collected at a different time, are shown on the right side (RGB CMand DSM CM). The DSMs are rendered in 3D using the “hillshade” technique to better visualize geometric details. Sunroof enables potential customers and policymakers to make informed decisions regarding solar energy by providing accurate solar energy estimates for individual buildings. Since its release, we estimate that Sunroof has been used in over 1 million residential solar projects. Installers report that the use of Sunroof substantially increases the likelihood of solar adoption by their customers. In order to accurately estimate a building’s solar energy potential it is necessary to ﬁrst create a detailed 3D model of it and its surrounding area. Even tiny features like chimneys, air vents or AC units can impact the viable install area for solar panels. Of particular importance is the precise geometry of the roof, as the expected angle of incidence of sunlight has a major impact on annual generated energy. Sunroof mainly uses a digital surface model (DSM) and a digital terrain model (DTM) to simulate solar potential, which are currently obtained from aerial imagery (15). Both give elevations as functions of location on a grid, with the DTM giving the elevation of the terrain, and the DSM providing the elevation inclusive of all objects, such as trees and buildings. The DSM can be computed from overlapping images using standard stereo vision algorithms. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 Sunroof relies on high quality, centimeter-level, aerial imagery in order to resolve details that are necessary for producing high accuracy solar estimates. However, even aerial imagery has varying degrees of quality. High ﬂying aircraft equipped with a single camera can cover a large area at lower resolution, while lower ﬂying aircraft equipped with calibrated multi-camera rigs are able to capture and register images at very high resolution. Other factors such as image registration quality and number of cameras used for stereoscopy, determine the signal to noise ratio of elevation data and therefore inﬂuence the effective resolution of the data. Figure 1 shows example DSMs com- puted from low and high quality image inputs, which we will refer to as sub-meter (DSM SM) and centimeter (DSM CM) scale, respectively. Sunroof relies on DSM CMdata to compute solar poten- tial estimates. Unfortunately, high quality aerial imagery is much more limited in its coverage and update frequency. In Section 3 we will discuss how this limitation was overcome and enabled Sun- roof to use widely available lower quality data, thus expanding its coverage, and thereby potentially increase the rate of solar adoption in new areas. 2 T HESUNROOF ALGORITHM Sunroof estimates the solar power potential for the buildings in a given area by performing ﬁve major processing steps outlined in Algorithm 1. Steps (1-4) are involved in computing the viable solar potential of individual buildings. The resulting energy predicted by steps (1-3) was physi- cally validated by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) (8). Furthermore, the entire pipeline has been validated by several major solar install companies which have queried millions of addresses via our API. Details of each step are described in Appendix A.
