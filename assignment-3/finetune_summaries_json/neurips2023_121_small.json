To advocate for legislation, current strategies aim to identify potential levers and obstacles, presenting an opportunity for the application of recent advances in machine learning language models. Here we propose a machine learning pipeline to analyse climate legislation, aiming to investigate the feasibility of natural language processing for the classification of climate legislation texts, to predict policy voting outcomes. By providing a model of the decision making process, the proposed pipeline can enhance transparency and aid policy advocates and decision makers in understanding legislative decisions, thereby providing a tool to monitor and understand legislative decisions towards climate positive impact. 1 Introduction Legislation is a key lever in fighting climate change. While climate policies lay out a plan of action, climate legislation is enforceable law. Legislation therefore has the potential to both help and hinder climate-positive progress, impacting societal change, public infrastructure, and industry. Despite recent commitments, current climate change mitigation efforts remain insufficient [ 11]. Existing solutions to fight climate change include low-carbon energy generation, tightening emissions regulations, limiting the destruction of carbon sequestering environments, and reducing agricultural emissions; these could halve global emissions, yet remain largely underutilised [ 12]. In large part, this is an issue of political will and legislative implementation [5]. However, history has shown that national efforts can be rapidly mobilised, such as during World War II, or the COVID-19 pandemic. Political decisions could therefore also rapidly utilise these existing solutions, and accelerate the development and deployment of new technologies, to fight climate change. Improved transparency around legislative decisions can aid decision makers in progress towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. To this end, policy advocates already attempt to keep track of policy approvals and their driving factors. However, understanding and predicting legislative decisions is highly complex. Machine learning offers techniques towards achieving this, through analysis, modelling, and explaining these decisions. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled the development of sophisticated tools to help tackle climate change [ 14], in domains from urban planning [ 10] to precision agriculture [ 9].

LLM = Large language model. particular relevance here, natural language processing (NLP) aims to enable machines to understand, process and generate human language. Increased computing power, coupled with transformer-based architectures, have enabled recent large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, PaLM 2, and LLaMA, to demonstrate unprecedented performance. Climate change-related applications of NLP have included understanding the effects of temperature on hate speech [ 17], and efforts are now emerging to utilise NLP specifically around climate legislation and policy, including: automatic summarisation [ 22], tracking national changes [ 3], automated policy evaluation [ 1], monitoring public discussion [ 7], classification of Paris Agreement Climate Action Plans [ 4], informing policy relating to climate justice [6], and integrating climate change adaptation policy [2]. In this contribution we propose a pipeline utilising NLP to better understand climate legislation decisions. We aim to investigate the feasibility of NLP for the classification of voting outcomes on proposed legislation. Applying established explainability techniques to the trained classifier can then aid understanding of the model and therefore provide insight into the driving factors of voting decisions themselves. The findings from implementing the pipeline could aid policy experts in legislation advocacy, while improving transparency, accountability, and community engagement; thereby empowering efforts towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. 2 Proposed methods The proposed approach is comprised of four components: Create a dataset (Figure 1a). Historically proposed climate legislation and associated parliamentary votes, such as are available online for the UK12and European Parliaments3. Accompanying texts are collected for climate sentiment and topic analysis. To enhance trustworthiness and reduce bias impacts, these should encompass a range of sources, including: parliamentary debate transcripts (e.g. Hansard4), news outlet articles, public consultation results, and social media posts. Utilising elements of computational argumentation [ 18], could enhance understanding of opinions and climate stances, with greater speed and scalability than current manual forms of gathering opinion data. Features relevant to parliamentary context will be included, such as\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
