Prior works involve an incentive de- sign mechanism which is dependent on knowl- edge of utility functions (energy use behavior) for the users, which is hard to compute when the number of users is high, common in buildings. We propose that the utilities can be grouped to a relatively small number of clusters, which can then be targeted with tailored incentives. Pro- posed work performs the above segmentation by learning the features leading to human decision making towards energy usage in competitive en- vironment. We propose a graphical lasso based approach with explainable nature for such seg- mentation, by studying the feature correlations in a real-world energy social game dataset. 1. Introduction and Related Work Energy consumption of buildings, both residential and com- mercial, account for approximately 40% of all energy usage in the U.S. (McQuade, 2009). To achieve energy efﬁciency in buildings, control and automation approaches alongside techniques like incentive design and price adjustment have been implemented (Ratliff, 2015). A building manager, act- ing as the connection between energy utilities and the end users, can encourage participation and energy-efﬁcient be- havior among occupants in many ways.

Although all such frameworks aim to achieve a long term or permanent improvement in the energy usage behaviors among the users, the aim is seldom achieved af- ter the completion of energy game, mostly attributed to the lack of an intelligent and adaptive incentive design pro- cess (Ratliff et al., 2014). The incentive design process in prior works is dependant on utility functions of every player in the game, which is hard to compute as buildings involve participation of a large number of energy users, so is often approximated using several estimation techniques (Ratliff, 2015). We propose that the utility/energy usage behavior of the players can be segmented into a relatively small number of clusters, and incentives can be designed to tailor each cluster. We utilize the potential of graphical lasso algo- rithm (Hastie et al., 2015) to perform such segmentation analysis in energy social games. 2. Methods 2.1. Energy Social Game Dataset The dataset used for our work is from a energy social game experiment in a smart residential housing, as introduced in (Konstantakopoulos et al., 2019). The dataset consists of per-minute time-stamped reading of desk light (D.L.), ceiling light (C.L.) and ceiling fan status (on/off), usage (in minutes) per day, points, rank, frequency of visits to the web portal, time of day, weekday/weekend, external features and indicators for breaks, midterms and ﬁnals for each player. 2.2. Proposed Segmentation Method For segmentation analysis, both supervised and unsuper- vised segmentation methods can be implemented on the social game dataset. For supervised classiﬁcation, we use rank (indicative of energy efﬁciency characteristics) as the label. But, such a classiﬁcation groups different players together as per their overall rank, not taking the distribution of their energy efﬁciency across different scenarios such asDo Occupants in a Building exhibit patterns in Energy Consumption?

To achieve energy efficiency in buildings, control and automation approaches alongside techniques like incentive design and price adjustment have been implemented (Ratliff, 2015). A building manager, acting as the connection between energy utilities and end-users, can encourage participation and energy-efficient behavior among occupants in many ways. One successful method proposed is a game-theoretic framework (Konstantakopoulos et al., 2019), which creates a friendly competition between occupants, motivating them to individually consider their own energy usage and seek to improve it. Although all such frameworks aim to achieve long-term or permanent improvement in energy usage behaviors among users, the aim is seldom achieved after the completion of the energy game, mostly attributed to the lack of an intelligent and adaptive incentive design process (Ratliff et al., 2014).
