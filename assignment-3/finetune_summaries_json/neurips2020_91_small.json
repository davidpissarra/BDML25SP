In both of these areas, new electrochemical materials and systems will be critical, but developing these systems currently relies heavily on compu- tationally expensive ﬁrst-principles simulations as well as human-time-intensive experimental trial and error. We propose to develop an automated workﬂow that accelerates these computational steps by introducing both automated error han- dling in generating the ﬁrst-principles training data as well as physics-informed machine learning surrogates to further reduce computational cost. It will also have the capacity to include automated experiments “in the loop” in order to dra- matically accelerate the overall materials discovery pipeline. 1 E LECTROCHEMISTRY AND CLIMATE CHANGE Electriﬁcation of virtually every energy-consuming sector is critical in the ﬁght against climate change, as it will enable society to rely on carbon-free energy sources such as solar and wind. Increased performance and reduced cost of electrochemical technologies will be key to this elec- triﬁcation process. Many are already familiar with phenomena such as “range anxiety”, as well as sticker shock for electric vehicles. Perhaps less familiar are the large swaths of the chemical industry that rely on extreme conditions (heat and pressure) produced by burning fossil fuels for large-scale synthesis of chemicals that are essential for fertilizers, steel, cement and other aspects of modern life that many of us take for granted. To meet the technoeconomic targets posed by these challenges, novel materials and systems will need to be designed. In this project, we propose to develop a generalizable and automated workﬂow for discovering and developing these materials and systems. It will have the capability to build the necessary ﬁrst-principles models and use their results to train machine learning surrogates that can be evaluated orders magnitude more quickly. The results of these models can be used in a series of 1coarser models to bridge from the atomic to the device scales and evaluate performance potential in a real system, including the possibility for an “in-the-loop” automated experimental evaluation. Using sequential learning, we can then select the next candidate from a speciﬁed design space and proceed through the workﬂow as many times as necessary to meet target performance speciﬁcations. 2 P ROPOSED WORKFLOW 2.1 O VERVIEW Figure 1: ML-aided materials discovery workﬂow. See Section 2.1 for a detailed description. The workﬂow we envision is summarized at a high level in Figure 1. The ﬁrst step (upper left) is to generate relevant atomic structures for the candidate molecules/materials. Initially, these will be fed into a ﬁrst-principles simulation engine such as density functional theory (DFT) or a quantum chemistry code. These calculations result in predicted materials properties that serve as parameters in a larger-scale model (such as one describing chemical kinetics of catalysis or the operation of a battery), from which device performance can be predicted. If the workﬂow is purely computational, this result will determine if the search has succeeded or whether a new candidate needs to be identi- ﬁed. If an automated experiment is “in the loop,” then this serves as a decision point for whether an experiment should be done. Assuming performance criteria have not yet been met, a new candidate material/molecule is selected using a sequential learning algorithm, and structures are generated to proceed through the loop again. Once enough ﬁrst-principles simulations have been run, the resulting data can be used to train an ML surrogate model to speed up candidate evaluation. A separate surrogate can be trained to accelerate the device modeling step. In addition to building these ML surrogates, we are also placing emphasis on automating any step in this workﬂow that currently requires human intervention, with the ultimate goal of the entire ma- terials discovery loop being autonomous. For example, running forward models (orange boxes in Figure 1) often requires, in addition to substantial computational resources, multiple steps of human decision-making, either to determine which speciﬁc calculations to do, or to resolve convergence errors arising from parameter choices. A signiﬁcant portion of this project is developing an auto- mated DFT workﬂow that can proceed entirely without this type of human input and hence eliminate associated delays.
