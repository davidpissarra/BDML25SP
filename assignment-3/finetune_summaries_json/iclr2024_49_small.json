The model is trained to probabilistically forecast day-ahead precipitation. Nonetheless, it is stable for multi-month rollouts, which reveal a qualitatively realistic superposition of con- vectively coupled wave modes in the tropics. Cross-spectral analysis confirms successful generation of low frequency variations associated with the Madden– Julian oscillation, which regulates most subseasonal to seasonal predictability in the observed atmosphere, and convectively coupled moist Kelvin waves with ap- proximately correct dispersion relationships. Despite secondary issues and biases, the results affirm the potential for a next generation of global diffusion models trained on increasingly sparse, and increasingly direct and differentiated observa- tions of the world, for practical applications in subseasonal and climate prediction. 1 I NTRODUCTION As machine learning-driven global forecasting systems exit their infancy and move beyond weather (Pathak et al., 2022; Bi et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2022) toward climate (Watt-Meyer et al., 2023; Weyn et al., 2019) timescales, whether they can be made to generate realistic convec- tively coupled tropical disturbances across daily to multi-week simulations becomes an important question. Such atmospheric variability has been a longstanding challenge to capture realistically in physics-based models (Randall, 2013) and is still incompletely understood (Zhang et al., 2020), yet regulates the subseasonal predictability of the Earth System, including important tropical to extrat- ropical teleconnections (Lau et al., 2005). These dynamics become especially interesting to examine in emerging autoregressive diffusion mod- els (Price et al., 2023; Mardani et al., 2024; Li et al., 2023; Nath et al., 2023) that learn conditional probabilities and are thus well suited to the stochastic character of tropical convective dynamics. Moreover, such methods suggest that diffusion models (Karras et al., 2022; Song et al., 2020) do not require complete information about the atmospheric state, and thus may have the capacity to pro- duce realistic variability even when trained on limited, direct (e.g., univariate) observations. Some recent work (Gao et al., 2023; Leinonen et al., 2023) has explored diffusion models with univariate weather data, but only on short-term scales and in small spatial domains; computational advances in GPU computing allow more ambition today. In this context, we introduce a computationally ambitious, high-resolution ( 0.4◦) global autore- gressive diffusion model trained solely on a satellite derived precipitation product. Precipitation is observed globally via microwave sensing satellites (e.g., TRMM, Kummerow et al. (1998) and ∗Work done during an internship at NVIDIA. 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Example 3-day rollout from Oct 27, 2020 as initial condition. GPM, Hou et al. (2014)), and prior low-order models have proven skillful at long-range forecasts (Chen et al., 2014). The coupling of both data and our modeling approach is pivotal to the feasibility of our current work. Using our trained model, we perform an in depth analysis of generated tropi- cal variability on 1- to 60-day timescale using domain-informed diagnostics, discovering long-term stability with realistic variability of multiple wave structures. 2 M ETHODOLOGY We introduce an autoregressive diffusion model, extending the EDM architecture (Karras et al., 2022) with the objective to estimate p(xt|xt−1)without incorporating additional priors. Achieving this goal assumes a paired spatiotemporal relationship within the underlying distribution to effec- tively capture the dynamics of the system based solely on the immediate past state. In doing so, our model can rollout predictions by utilizing the estimated next step as the subsequent initial condition. The design specifics of our model are inspired by the work of prior global diffusion-based weather forecasting models. Specifically, we build upon the work of Mardani et al. (2024), which employs a similar architecture for km-scale downscaling. However, we avoid the use of an intermediate regression model and do not scale down the conditional inputs. Price et al. (2023) present a purely autoregressive diffusion model, but train on a comprehensive state vector given from reanalysis data, where instead we directly estimate a single observational state.
