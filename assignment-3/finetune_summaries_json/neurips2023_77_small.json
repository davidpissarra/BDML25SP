The gap between reanalysis and reality has sparked growing interest in training ML models directly on observations such as weather stations. Modelling scattered and sparse environmental observations requires scalable and flexible ML architectures, one of which is the convolutional conditional neural process (ConvCNP).

However, the sparsity of real observations presents a challenge for data-hungry deep learning models like the ConvCNP. One potential solution is ‘Sim2Real’: pre-training on reanalysis and fine-tuning on observational data. We analyse Sim2Real with a ConvCNP trained to interpolate surface air temperature over Germany, using varying numbers of weather stations for fine-tuning. On held-out weather stations, Sim2Real training substantially outperforms the same model architecture trained only with reanalysis data or only with station data, showing that reanalysis data can serve as a stepping stone for learning from real observations. Sim2Real could thus enable more accurate models for weather prediction and climate monitoring. 1 Introduction Every day, millions of observations of the Earth system are collected by environmental sensors, such as in-situ weather stations, satellites, aircraft, oceanographic buoys, and meteorological balloons [1]. However, the spatial distance between neighbouring observations can be very large for certain variables, particularly in remote regions like Antarctica or the Himalayas. This presents a challenge for flexible deep learning models that require an abundance of data to learn realistic physical behaviour. As a result, deep learning systems developed for environmental prediction tasks often use gridded reanalysis datasets for training, rather than observations. Reanalysis data is produced by assimilating observations into a dynamical model to predict geophysical quantities (such as temperature) on a regular spatiotemporal grid [ 1]. Data-driven models trained with reanalysis data have recently made striking progress in weather forecasting [2–6].

A limitation of training with reanalysis target data is the mismatch between the dynamical model simulator and reality, owing to several factors, including: • error between physical laws in the simulator and true physics, • spatiotemporal coarseness (typically ∼25 km spatially and ∼1 hrtemporally), • not capturing real-world observation aleatoric uncertainty (e.g. sensor noise). We call the combination of the above mismatches the ‘Sim2Real gap’. Despite rapid advances in reanalysis-trained large machine learning (ML) weather forecasting models, such as GraphCast [ 2] and Pangu-Weather [ 6], the Sim2Real gap will degrade the utility of these models to some degree. A recent approach to overcoming the Sim2Real gap in weather forecasting is MetNet-3 [ 7], which forecasts both simulator and observation data in a multi-task setting. An important open question is if accurate ML weather models can be trained purely on environmental observations, perhaps bypassing the data assimilation step of numerical simulators and overcoming the Sim2Real gap. This paper investigates Sim2Real transfer for Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvC- NPs) [ 8]. ConvCNPs are flexible deep learning models that produce probabilistic predictions over yT at target locations XTconditioned on context observations (XC,yC)by computing a marginal Gaus- sian mean and variance at each target location. The negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss can then be calculated in closed form and directly minimised via backpropagation (Appendix C). Convolutional neural process variants have shown promising results in weather modelling tasks such as downscaling [9] and sensor placement [ 10]. The Sim2Real gap motivates training a ConvCNP to interpolate real station data, which could provide more realistic estimates of observation informativeness and suggest better sensor placements than a reanalysis-only ConvCNP. In this work, to quantify the benefits of Sim2Real, a ConvCNP is first pre-trained on vast amounts of reanalysis data, and then a smaller but higher-quality real weather station dataset is used to fine-tune and evaluate the model (Fig. 1). 2 Spatial Temperature Interpolation In this experiment, a ConvCNP is trained to spatially interpolate 2-metre air temperature context observations at a given time instant (XC,yC)to predict target values yTat the same time instant at\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
