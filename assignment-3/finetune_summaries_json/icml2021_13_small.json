Introduction The ocean within the global climate exhibits an array of changes in response to anthropogenic forcing, with vari- ability poorly constrained by models (Zhang et al., 2019; Larson et al., 2020; Cheng et al., 2013; Weaver et al., 2012; Weijer et al., 2020; Meehl et al., 2000). Ocean circulation changes could have catastrophic impacts on society, such as changes in rainfall, severe weather, sea level rise and large scale climate patterns, because of the vast amounts of heat and carbon it governs. Tools from machine learning (ML) are well placed to help address challenges towards under- standing ocean and climate variability. Another key tool to understand future changes is the Coupled Model Intercom- parison Project (CMIP6) (Meehl et al., 2000; 2007; Taylor et al., 2012; Eyring et al., 2015). The CMIP6 ensemble is a comprehensive ensemble of climate models, and the simula- tions are vital tools for understanding variability. However, the model variability often is reduced to bulk metrics e.g. summarizing complex dynamics with single numbers leav- ing speciﬁc mechanisms opaque (Weijer et al., 2020). This is because the complexity and size of the CMIP6 model ensemble can hinder data dissemination and analysis. Such hurdles are examples of an emerging class of problems in CMIP6 and beyond, where researchers must handle data that is increasingly large, potentially sparse, and due to logistics of e.g. dissemination, often unavailable (Eyring et al., 2019). The Tracking global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) method addresses the known capability gap of analysis tools for climate models (Eyring et al., 2019; Schlund et al., 2020; Reichstein et al., 2019), while opening the ‘black box’ often associated with ML applications.THOR: Revealing the impact of global warming on climate modes Figure 1.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe global climate is experiencing changes in response to anthropogenic forcing, with ocean variability poorly constrained by models. The ocean's array of changes includes sea level rise and large-scale climate patterns. The mechanisms of change remain unclear, but a new machine learning method, Tracking Global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR), is presented here. We investigate two future scenarios: one where CO2 is increased by 1% per year, and one where CO2 is abruptly quadrupled. THOR combines interpretable and explainable methods to reveal its predictive skill. At its core, THOR identifies dynamically coherent regimes governing ocean circulation, a fundamental question in oceanography.\n\nWe examine three key regions: the North Atlantic circulation, which delivers heat to higher latitudes, and is seen to weaken, with associated dynamical changes. The Southern Ocean circulation, the strongest on Earth, is found to intensify, with implications for interactions with ice on Antarctica. In the tropical Pacific region, shifts in ocean circulation regimes are identified, with potential impacts on the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, a dominant source of year-to-year climate variations affecting weather extremes, ecosystems, agriculture, and fisheries.\n\nTHOR also constitutes a step towards trustworthy machine learning, as its predictions are physically tractable. We conclude by highlighting open questions and potential avenues for further machine learning applications in climate research.\n\nThe ocean's response to anthropogenic forcing is complex and poorly understood, with variability constrained by models. Ocean circulation changes could have catastrophic impacts on society, including changes in rainfall, severe weather, and sea level rise. Machine learning tools are well-suited to help address these challenges. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) provides a comprehensive ensemble of climate models, but the model variability is often reduced to bulk metrics, leaving specific mechanisms opaque.\n\nThe Tracking Global Heating with Ocean Regimes (THOR) method addresses the limitations of current analysis tools for climate models, while opening the 'black box' often associated with machine learning applications. THOR is engineered for interpretability and explainability, making it a step towards trustworthy machine learning.\n\nThe THOR method is a transparent machine learning application that combines machine learning and oceanographic domain knowledge. We demonstrate its power on three ocean features critical to climate applications."
