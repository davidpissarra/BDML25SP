Introduction The Optimal Power Flow problem (OPF) consists of deter- mining the optimal operating levels for different generators within a transmission network in order to meet the demand that is changing over space and time. An established area of research in both power systems and operations, OPF is ap- plied every day in the management and regulation of power grids around the world. In this work, we hope to obtain real-time approximate solutions to the OPF problem using machine learning. The classical formulation of ACOPF (presented in Section 3) is a challenging non-convex and NP-hard problem (Bien- stock & Verma, 2015). In addition to minimizing generator costs, solutions must adhere to physical laws governing power ﬂow (i.e. Kirchhoff’s voltage law) and respect the engineering limits of the grid. As a result, ACOPF is com- putationally intractable under the demands of daily grid management. In order to account for rapid ﬂuctuations in power demand and supply, grid operators must solve ACOPF over the entire grid (comprising of tens of thou- sands of nodes) every ﬁve minutes1(Cain et al., 2012). Most traditional approaches (genetic algorithms, convex re- laxations, etc) either fail to converge within this time frame 1Carnegie Mellon University2Stanford University.

Presented at the Climate Change Workshop at ICML 2019 1The addition of renewable sources of energy (wind, solar, etc) adds more unpredictability and is a motivation for improved techniques for ACOPFor produce suboptimal solutions. In order to practically man- age the grid, operators solve a linearized version of ACOPF practice known as DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF). How- ever, DCOPF presents a number of issues. True grid con- ditions can deviate from the linear assumptions imposed by DCOPF, increasing the likelihood of instability and grid failure (Frank & Rebennack, 2016). Relying on DCOPF also has signiﬁcant implications for climate change. A 2012 report from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission estimated that the inefﬁciencies induced by approximate- solution techniques may cost billions of dollars and release unnecessary emissions (Cain et al., 2012). Determining an efﬁcent solution for ACOPF could also be adapted to com- bined economic emission dispatch (CEED) - a variant of OPF which incorporates a per-generator emissions cost into the classic objective function (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In this paper, we observe that it should be possible to learn a model that can predict an accurate solution over a ﬁxed grid topology/constraint set. Intuitively, we expect some measure of consistency in the solution space - similar load distributions should correspond to similar generator settings. This suggests an underlying structure to the ACOPF prob- lem, which a machine learning model can exploit. Machine learning present several advantages. Neural net- works have demonstrated the ability to model extremely complicated non-convex functions, making them highly at- tractive for this setting. A model could be trained off-line on historic data and used in real-time to make predictions on an optimal power setting. In this work, we explore two applications of machine learning for OPF: 1. End-to-end : Train a model to directly predict the optimal generator setting for a given load distribution. This is challenging, as the model’s output must be adherence with physical laws/engineering limits. 2. Constraint prediction : Train a model to predict which constraints are active (i.e at equality) in the optimal solution. Knowing this active set can be used to warm start existing approaches (i.e. interior point methods) and reduce solution time.Submission and Formatting Instructions for ICML 2019 2. Related Work Prior work has explored different applications of machine learning on the grid. This includes work on estimating active constraints for DCOPF (Ng et al., 2018; Misra et al., 2018), predicting grid failures (Rudin et al., 2012), or choosing between traditional solvers (King et al., 2015). Machine learning has also been applied to related variants of the OPF problem, including automated grid protection (Donnot et al., 2017), price proxy prediction (Canyasse et al., 2016), or private information recovery (Donti et al.). To the extent of our knowledge, there has been limited work on direct applications of deep learning towards ACOPF. 3.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe Optimal Power Flow (OPF) problem consists of determining the optimal operating levels for different generators within a transmission network to meet changing demand over space and time. OPF is a well-established area of research in power systems and operations, applied daily in the management and regulation of power grids worldwide. This work aims to obtain real-time approximate solutions to the OPF problem using machine learning.\n\nThe classical formulation of ACOPF is a challenging non-convex and NP-hard problem. In addition to minimizing generator costs, solutions must adhere to physical laws governing power flow (Kirchhoff's voltage law) and respect engineering limits of the grid. As a result, ACOPF is computationally intractable under the demands of daily grid management. To account for rapid fluctuations in power demand and supply, grid operators must solve ACOPF over the entire grid (comprising tens of thousands of nodes) every five minutes.\n\nMost traditional approaches (genetic algorithms, convex relaxations, etc.) either fail to converge within this time frame. The addition of renewable sources of energy (wind, solar, etc.) adds more unpredictability, motivating improved techniques for ACOPF. To practically manage the grid, operators solve a linearized version of ACOPF, known as DC Optimal Power Flow (DCOPF).

Relying on DCOPF also has significant implications for climate change, with estimated costs of billions of dollars and unnecessary emissions.\n\nDetermining an efficient solution for ACOPF could be adapted to combined economic emission dispatch (CEED), a variant of OPF that incorporates a per-generator emissions cost into the classic objective function. We observe that it should be possible to learn a model that can predict an accurate solution over a fixed grid topology/constraint set. Intuitively, we expect some measure of consistency in the solution space, suggesting an underlying structure to the ACOPF problem that a machine learning model can exploit.\n\nMachine learning presents several advantages, including the ability to model extremely complicated non-convex functions.
