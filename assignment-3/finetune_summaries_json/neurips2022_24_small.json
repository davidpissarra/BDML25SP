However, a common issue of satellite images is missing values due to measurement defects, which render them unusable by existing methods without data imputation. To repair the data, inpainting methods can be employed, which are based on classical PDEs or interpolation methods. Recently, deep learning approaches have shown promise in this realm, however many of these methods do not explicitly take into account the inherent spatio-temporal structure of satellite images. In this work, we cast satellite image inpainting as a meta-learning problem, and implement Convolutional Neural Processes (ConvNPs) in which we frame each satellite image as its own task or 2D regression problem. We show that ConvNPs outperform classical methods and state-of-the-art deep learning inpainting models on a scanline problem for LANDSAT 7 satellite images, assessed on a variety of in- and out-of-distribution images. Our results successfully match the performance of clean images on a downstream water body segmentation task in Canada. 1 Introduction Monitoring climate change requires the analysis of land features at a granular spatio-temporal level. With the surge of computational methods using remote sensing data, satellite images have been widely used in instances such as flood detection [ 1] and crop yield modelling [ 2]. The LANDSAT 7 satellite [ 3] is an invaluable source of satellite images to understand these trends and take appropriate action based on accurate climate models due to its long temporal coverage and high spatial resolution. However, as a result of a mechanical fault in the satellite’s scanline corrector (SLC), satellite images taken from May 31, 2003 onward suffer from lines of missing pixels (Figure 3). As they occupy a significant area of the satellite images (about 20% of the data), the images obtained from LANDSAT 7 lost much of their research use in climate-related downstream tasks as the scanlines significantly impair the performance of computational methods using the corrupted images. However, existing ML or traditional satellite image models are able to process imputed images as opposed to retraining *Equal contribution.†Order decided by a coin toss. 1Imperial College London.2University of Copenhagen.3University of Oxford. 4United States Military Academy, Workshop mentor Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.models or explicitly taking into account missing data, which is currently required for corrupted images. Image inpainting (gap-filling) aims to fill the corrupted pixels in an image with values that resemble the original pixel values as closely as possible. Many deterministic methods have been proposed in the literature, that use higher order differential equations [ 4–6]. Moreover, recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results such as U-Net [ 7], which was initially used for biomedical image segmentation, and Partial Convolutions (PartialConv) [ 8], which is a modification to the classical convolutional layer to make it suitable for inpainting. One drawback of the traditional deep learning methods is that they treat all images as a single task and do not take into account spatio-temporal differences between images, where different predictive functions could better suit different tasks or images. This kind of problem is better suited to meta-learning methods, which learn task-specific representations and are better at capturing the differences between various inputs. Garnelo et al. [9]introduced a meta-learning approach called Conditional Neural Processes (CNPs) that uses an encoder-decoder architecture to learn a distribution over predictive functions. Gordon et al. [10] and Foong et al. [11] introduced Convolutional Conditional Neural Processes (ConvCNPs) and Convolutional Latent Neural Processes (ConvLNPs) respectively, which are better suited for image inpainting tasks due to their translational equivariance property. These Convolutional Neural Processes are shown to exhibit very good few-shot and zero-shot learning capabilities as well, which has been demonstrated for inpainting weather data [11, 12]. In this paper, we show that ConvNPs can be used for satellite image inpainting, particularly to correct the scanlines of LANDSAT 7 images. We use an MS-SSIM similarity score loss function [ 13] for sharper results, which preserves important land features for segmentation or regression tasks. We show that our ConvNPs outperform state-of-the-art image inpainting models with a relatively small dataset (training set of 800 images with dimensions 128x128 or 64x64). ConvNP models also show good performance for both in-distribution (inpainting images in the same country as the training dataset) and out-of-distribution (OOD) satellite images (considered as zero-shot tasks, inp\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
