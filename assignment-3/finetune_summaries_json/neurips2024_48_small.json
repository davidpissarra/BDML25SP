Having access to flowering phenology, more accurate predictions may be made. We propose a novel multi-modal wildflower monitoring task to better identify species, levering both expert-annotated wildflower images and flowering phenology estimates. Moreover, we benchmark several state-of-the-art models using two groups of common wild- flower species that have high inter-class similarity, and show that this multi-modal approach significantly outperforms image-only baselines. With this work, we aim to encourage the development of standards for automated wildflower monitoring as a step towards bending the curve of biodiversity loss. 1 Introduction Habitat loss, pollution and climate change are the primary drivers of biodiversity loss, causing ecosystems to degrade which, in turn, impacts human well-being [3]. Flowering plants play a vital part in supporting ecosystems, attracting pollinators which in turn enable plants to develop seeds to produce more flowers [18]. Nearly half of the world’s known flowering plant species are potentially threatened with extinction according to a new study [2]. The UK alone is reported to have lost 97% of its wildflower meadows since the 1930s [7]. It is crucial to understand biodiversity trends for preservation policy planning. However, due to the amount of effort and expertise required for conventional field monitoring, large knowledge gaps remain. In the last few years, deep learning—with a focus on computer vision and object detection —has been proposed to automate in-situ wildflower monitoring by identifying and counting species in images [10, 15, 22]. As it turns out, however, wildflower monitoring combines a unique set of challenges for computer vision as illustrated in figure 1. The latter two challenges are particularly hard for current models: some images of the same species may have significant visual differences, while at the same time visual similarities in shape and color may exist between different species. This visual confusion makes it difficult even for humans to distinguish the species without deeper expertise, and subsequently limits the construction of automated wildflower monitoring models. We therefore propose a multi-modal approach that includes information on flowering phenology to help overcome the flower inter-class similarity and intra-class variation challenges. Flowering phenology refers to the study of the timing of seasonal events in flowering plants over their growth cycle. Our approach leverages the fact that the visual characteristics as well as the presence of flowers Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: Challenges of flower identification. 1) viewpoint variations ( Papaver rhoeas ); 2) occlusion (Ranunculus repens ); 3) clutter ( Achillea millefolium ); 4) light variation ( Leucanthemum vulgare ); 5) deformations ( Bellis perennis ); 6) intra-class variation ( Ficaria verna ); 7) inter-class similarity (Bellis perennis,Leucanthemum vulgare,Matricaria chamomilla ). Source: EWD [22] at a given point in time highly depends on their estimated flowering time. We present a novel multi- modal wildflower monitoring task (section 2) combining high-quality annotated wildflower images from the Netherlands [22] with flowering phenology measurements from a public database [16] and benchmark and discuss several multi-modal models (section 3) to encourage machine learning research that may help us monitor, understand, and ultimately preserve biodiversity. 2 Task definition We aim to jointly use expert-annotated images and flowering phenology estimates to identify wild- flower species; thus, our task can be considered a supervised multi-modal object detection problem. Remote sensing [1, 15, 24], drone acquired [8] or in-situ collected [10, 17, 23] wildflower image datasets have been successfully used in object detection solutions, however, their annotation quality varies wildly. For real-world images with many visually similar species, precisely labeled and annotated high-quality images are essential [5, 6]. We use the Eindhoven Wildflower Dataset (EWD), which offers a significantly larger collection of wildflower images comprising 160 species from various habitats in the Netherlands with guaranteed in-situ high-quality expert-annotated images based on well-established guidelines [22]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first multi-modal object detection task allowing fine-grained classification of a wide range of visually similar wildflower species using flowering phenology estimates. Similar multi-modal approaches consider such auxiliary information into the classification, for instance spatio-temporal information (latitude, latitude, altitude, date) as a source of non-visual a priori information about flower species, as well as additional visual information from satellite images based on spatio-temporal information [4, 14]. However, their temporal information is limited by the presence-only data, which inherently lacks information about the species growth cycle. Furthermore, disclosure of exact locations of flowers is less desirable, especially if the\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
