This has been proven challenging, as ocean wave information is typically not provided by climate models, ocean wave numerical modeling is computationally ex- pensive, and most global wave climate ensembles exclude the Arctic region. Here we present a framework to develop a CNN-LSTM deep learn- ing network which could be potentially used to obtain such a large ensemble of Arctic wave pro- jections at an affordable cost. 1. Introduction The Arctic is a hot spot for global climate change as it is warming about twice as fast as global temperatures due to the so-called Arctic ampliﬁcation. This is leading to a rapid decline in sea ice extend; the Arctic sea-ice extend has shrunk by an average of 13.4% with the last two low- est records occurring over the last decade (Witze, 2020). Recent climate simulations project a likely ice-free Arctic summer by mid-century (Wei et al., 2020) although it could be as early as 2035 (Guarino et al., 2020). Extended ice-free seasons and expanded open water areas favor the increase of ocean surface waves (Casas-Prat & Wang, 2020a). This poses a great risk to coastal communities (due to increased 1Environment and Climate Change Canada, Climate Research Division, Toronto, Canada2Universit ´e de Montr ´eal, Montr ´eal, Canada3Ottawa University, Ottawa, Canada.

This is a pressing issue as this exacerbates existing vulnerabilities in low-lying Arctic coastal areas, which have already experienced coastal damage in the last few years (Casas-Prat & Wang, 2020b). Climate models are constantly updated to produce (im- proved) simulations of future climate. These coordinated efforts are part of the international Coupled Model Intercom- parison Projects (CMIP), in the context of the Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The 2013 IPCC ﬁfth assessment report (AR5) featured climate models from CMIP5, while the upcoming 2021 IPCC sixth assessment report (AR6) will feature new state-of-the-art CMIP6 mod- els. A key objective of CMIP is to develop large ensembles of standard climate projections that account for the main factors of uncertainty: climate model parameterizations, in- ternal climate variability, greenhouse gas scenario. Morim et al. (2019) showed, for instance, that a single method to asses projected changes in ocean wave heights might be unable to capture up to 50% of the total uncertainty. An in-depth understanding of the future changes in ocean wave climate is key to develop a climate adaptation strat- egy that properly addresses the aforementioned challenges. Casas-Prat & Wang (2020b) developed and presented the ﬁrst regional multi-model Arctic ocean wave ensemble, which was obtained with a dynamical numerical modelling approach driven by simulations from ﬁve CMIP5 models. Their historical simulations were validated against state-of- the-art reanalysis (historical simulated data that assimilate observations) and found that their simulations were within the range of uncertainty of such reference products. Their future simulations showed that the annual maximum wave heights along coastlines would increase about 1–3 m by the end of the century, representing a relative increase up to 2–3 times their historical value. While these projected changes are statistically robust, conﬁdence is low due to using a small ensemble. Currently, there is lack of evidence that a climate model of better performance in simulating the historical climate will necessarily produce better projections of future climate. This lack of evidence is more so in the dramatically chang-Deep learning network to project future Arctic ocean waves ing Arctic region as climate biases might change over time due to the strong climate change responses. Therefore, a large ensemble of wave projections is needed to cover major sources of uncertainty. This has been proven challenging as most climate models do not include information about ocean surface waves and ocean wave numerical modelling is computationally expensive. Also, most global wave pro- jections (needed to provide boundary conditions for Arctic regional numerical modelling) exclude the Arctic region or do not account for sea ice (Morim et al., 2019). To reduce computational cost, statistical methods have been developed and implemented in the past decade. These are typically based on weather maps or grid point regression models with physical-based predictors, and their performance can be comparable to that of numerical simulations. However, none has been applied to the Arctic region, probably due to the complex explicit implementation of the sea ice driver in simpliﬁed predictors, and the inability to use reanalysis data (only\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
