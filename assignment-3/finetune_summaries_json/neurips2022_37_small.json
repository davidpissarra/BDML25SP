However, model performance can suffer when models are applied to stylistically different geographies. We propose a technique to generate synthetic imagery using minimal labeled examples of the target object at a low computational cost. Our technique blends example objects onto unlabeled images of the target domain. We show that including these synthetic images improves the average precision of a YOLOv3 object detection model when compared to a baseline and other popular domain adaptation techniques. 1 Introduction From power plants to wildfires, many of the causes and consequences of climate change are visible from above. Accurate geospatial information about the causes of climate change including energy infrastructure systems is critical to planning climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, spatial data on current energy infrastructure is often lacking – the data may not be publicly available, may be incomplete, or may not contain sufficient granularity [1]. Recent research has demonstrated the potential of using satellite imagery to fill the data gaps by monitoring energy systems at unprecedented frequencies and scale [2] [3]. Two remaining challenges to applying these techniques at scale include: (1) a lack of large datasets with labeled data for relevant applications, and (2) the challenge of applying these techniques across diverse geographic domains. Northwest Southwest Eastern Midwest  a b Figure 1: Overhead images of wind turbines from different regions of the United States The first issue is the high number of labeled examples required to successfully train a model. Build- ing the right dataset can be challenging because of the labor-intensive nature of accurate data labeling ∗Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.[4]. This is of particular significance in the case where the object of interest is rare and few labeled instances may exist, which is arguably often the case for data related to energy and climate systems. The second challenge is to apply these techniques across geographic domains. While we are often limited to acquiring image data from a narrow set of geographies, we may want to apply models more broadly to different geographic regions. This difference in the visual properties of the images we use to train versus those we use to test our models is known as the domain gap and deep neural network models often perform unreliably in such conditions [5]. Our experiments trained object detection models to detect one type of energy infrastructure, wind turbines, and differentiated between within- domain experiments in which we create a wind turbine detection model using training and testing imagery from the same geographic domain, versus cross-domain experiments where we train our model on one domain and test it on a different domain. As an example, a within-domain experiment may train on images of wind turbines from the Northwest U.S. and validate on other images from the Northwest. In contrast, a cross-domain experiment may train on images from the Northwest and test on images from the Southwest. We expect object detection performance to suffer in cross-domain contexts due to the presence of a domain gap. We experimentally demonstrated the existence of a domain gap in our dataset in Figure 2 by showing how, on average, within-domain performance of our object detection models was far greater than cross-domain performance for each test domain. Figure 2: Baseline experimental results demonstrating evidence of the domain gap. The gap in per- formance between within-domain and cross-domain settings is shown in this figure as the distance between the red and blue points (and further described in section 3) Two approaches to domain adaptation in remote sensing imagery are transforming the images in a dataset to lessen the differences between the training and testing domains or supplementing the dataset with synthetic imagery that helps to close that gap (e.g., Synthinel-1 [6], SIMPL [7], [8]). Color based transformations leave image content unchanged but vary the color of pixels in an image, mapping pixels of each color to a new value. For example, histogram equalization adjusts image pixel intensity values such that they follow a uniform distribution to standardize image appearance regardless of domain. In contrast, generative methods create synthetic images that may modify both the pixel values and the information content of an image. Examples of generative methods that have been applied for domain adaptation include CyCADA [9] and CycleGAN [10]. We compare our approach to a selection of these methods. We propose a domain adaptation method based on generating synthetic overhead images designed to require few labeled examples. Our technique takes advantage of unlabeled overhead images to reduce the number of labeled examples required. Unlabeled images are often easily acquirable through public datasets such as the National Agriculture Imagery Program (NAIP) [11]. Our exper- iments show the potential of our technique to improve downstream model performance as compared to other domain adaptation techniques in this space – especially in situations with limited training data and when applying a model to new geographies. 2 Methodology 2.1 Experimental dataset creation To test our domain adaptation technique, we created a dataset of overhead images containing wind turbines from three distinct geographic domains.
