Global warming-induced climate change increases the challenge of accurately predicting severe precipitation events, such as heavy rainfall. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based precipitation post-processor for numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. The precipitation post-processor consists of (i) employing self-supervised pre-training, where the parameters of the encoder are pre-trained on the reconstruction of the masked variables of the atmospheric physics domain; and (ii) conducting transfer learning on precipitation segmentation tasks (the target domain) from the pre-trained encoder. In addition, we introduced a heuristic labeling approach to effectively train class- imbalanced datasets. Our experiments on precipitation correction for regional NWP show that the proposed method outperforms other approaches. 1 Introduction In modern society, precipitation forecasting plays a vital role in the response to and prevention of social and economic damage. Deep learning has been rapidly utilized in precipitation forecasting, such as for simulating echo movements and predicting typhoon trajectories based on observational data [12,13,10,1]. However, exclusively relying on observational data fails to capture the fundamental physical and dynamic mechanisms in the real world. This results in an exponential increase in error as the forecast lead time increases [ 3]. In addition, climate change increases the uncertainty of predicting extreme events such as torrential rains [ 9]. A limited forecast lead time makes it difficult to prepare for extreme weather events in advance. Recent research has been actively conducted to enhance forecast lead times via the post-processing of numerical weather prediction (NWP) model data [ 8,6,11,16]. Espeholt et al. [ 3] proposed Metnet2, a 12-h probabilistic forecasting model. They designed a hybrid model consisting of a forecasting model based on observational data and post-processing NWP model data. While Metnet2 displayed promising results, simulating heavy rainfall remains a challenging task. Therefore, we designed a self-supervised pre-training process that considers the physical and dynamic processes among atmospheric variables to improve the relative bias and reliability of predicting ∗These authors contributed equally to this work. †Corresponding author Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Process of learning the precipitation post-processor. The model consists of two main phases: 1) pre-training the encoder and decoder using a reconstruction task after masking the inputs and 2) training the decoder for precipitation prediction using the trained encoder.

To this end, we randomly masked three-dimensional (3D) images [ 5] and trained an encoder-decoder to reconstruct variables based on dynamic sparse kernels (DSKs) [ 14]. Subsequently, we trained a decoder for probability-based precipitation correction based on a pre-trained encoder. The pre-training process helps in conducting a correlation analysis based on the NWP model variables and provides additional data-augmentation effects. Finally, we propose a continuous labeling method for learning class-imbalanced datasets. This method facilitates a continuous probability distribution based on the precipitation density. 2 Method This section describes the proposed approach. We first present a self-supervised pre-training procedure that aims to define the reconstruction task. Subsequently, we describe the target process for the precipitation post-processing. 2.1 Problem formulation Given a set of ground-truth pairs G= ({xi}n i=1,{yj}m j=1)withx∈Rn×h×w,y∈Rm×h×w, and z∈Rd, letx={x1,···, xn}Trepresent the input, and y={y1,···ym}Trepresent the output. Our objective is to derive a precipitation segmentation function f:Rd→Rc, assuming z∈Rdas a latent space with distribution p(z)defined by the pre-training process. The task involves reconstructing f′ ϑ from the NWP data to predict the target object function fθ. The probabilistic encoder-decoder of the proposed method is defined as follows: L(θ, ϑ;x) =−1 2Eqϑ(z|x)[||x−ˆx||2 2] + KL( qϑ(z|x)|p∗(y)), (1) where ˆxdenotes the reconstructed output from xas generated by decoder, qϑrepresents the pre- training process distribution, and p∗is the class probability distribution, detailed in Section 2.2. The loss function combines the mean squared error for minimizing pre-training loss and the Kullback- Leibler (KL) divergence term to quantify the difference between the learned latent variable distribution qϑ(z|x)and the class probability distribution p∗(y). 2.2 Continuous labeling In multi\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
