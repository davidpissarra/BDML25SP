In press.Cross-Chapter Box 9658 CCB9 CCB9Executive Summary Ocean and cryosphere changes already impact Low-Lying Islands and Coasts (LLIC), including Small  Island  Developing States (SIDS), with cascading and compounding risks. Disproportionately higher risks  are  expected  in the course of the 21st century. Reinforcing the findings of the IPCC Special Report on  Global Warming of 1.5ºC, vulnerable human communities, especially those in coral reef environments and polar  regions, may exceed adaptation limits well before the end of this century and even in a low greenhouse gas  emission pathway ( high confidence1). Depending on the effectiveness of 21st century mitigation and adaptation  pathways under all emission scenarios, most of the low-lying regions around the world may face adaptation  limits beyond 2100, due to the long-term commitment of sea level rise ( medium confidence ). LLIC host around  11% of the global population, generate about 14% of the global Gross Domestic Product and comprise many world cultural  heritage sites. LLIC already experience climate-related ocean and cryosphere changes ( high confidence ), and they share both  commonalities in their exposure and vulnerability to climate change (e.g., low elevation, human disturbances to terrestrial  and marine ecosystems), and context-specificities (e.g., variable ecosystem climate sensitivities and risk perceptions by  populations). Options to adapt to rising seas, e.g., range from hard engineering to ecosystem-based measures, and from  securing current settings to relocating people, built assets and activities. Effective combinations of measures vary across  geographies (cities and megacities, small islands, deltas and Arctic coasts), and reflect the scale of observed and projected  impacts, ecosystems’ and societies’ adaptive capacity, and the existence of transformational governance ( high confidence )  {Sections 3.5.3, 4.4.2 to 4.4.5, 5.5.2, 6.8, 6.9, Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1}. Introduction LLIC are already experiencing the impacts of climate-related changes to the ocean and cryosphere, for both extreme events  and slow onset changes (Sections 4.3.3, 5.3.1 to 5.3.6, 6.2, 6.8, 6.9), due to their low elevation, narrow ecological zonation,  climate sensitive ecosystems and natural resources, as well as increasing anthropogenic pressures (Sections 1.5, 4.3.2).  High levels of impacts to coastal morphology, ecosystems and dependent human communities are detectable today and  disproportionately higher risks are expected in the course of the 21st century ( medium evidence, high agreement ) (Sections  4.3.4, 5.3.7), even under a low emission pathway compatible with a 1.5ºC global warming (Hoegh-Guldberg et al., 2018; IPCC,  2018). The magnitude of projected impacts (i.e., risks; Cross-Chapter Box 2 in Chapter 1) will depend on future greenhouse  gas emissions and the associated climate changes, as well as on other drivers such as population movement into risk-prone  areas and societal efforts to adapt.  LLIC include a wide diversity of systems (Figure CB9.1).
