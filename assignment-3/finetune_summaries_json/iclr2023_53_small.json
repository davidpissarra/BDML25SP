Wolf et al. (2020) created a plastic waste dataset to develop a plastic detection system. Our work aims to improve the machine learning model by using Green Automated Machine Learning (AutoML). One as- pect of Green-AutoML is to search for a machine learning pipeline, while also minimizing the carbon footprint. In this work, we train five standard neural ar- chitectures for image classification on the aforementioned plastic waste dataset. Subsequently, their performance and carbon footprints are compared to an Effi- cient Neural Architecture Search as a well-known AutoML approach. We show the potential of Green-AutoML by outperforming the original plastic detection system by 1.1% in accuracy and using 33 times fewer floating point operations at inference, and only 29% of the carbon emissions of the best-known baseline. This shows the large potential of AutoML on climate-change relevant applications and at the same time contributes to more efficient modern Deep Learning systems, saving substantial resources and reducing the carbon footprint. 1 I NTRODUCTION Plastic pollution in oceans has become a threat to ocean health, the health of marine species, and food safety. Therefore, the UN set the conservation of the oceans as one of the Sustainable Develop- ment Goals (Desa et al., 2016). The detection and quantification of plastic waste is the first step to confronting this danger. Wolf et al. (2020) created a labeled dataset of polluted coastline images and a system to detect floating plastic litter, see Figure 1 for an example. Their system uses a two-step approach which first detects litter and then quantifies it. The work at hand aims to improve the first part, i.e. the plastic detector, in terms of accuracy and carbon emissions.1 Figure 1: Example image of the dataAs discussed by Tornede et al. (2021) and Tu et al. (2022), Green Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has the potential to greatly contribute to effi- ciently finding better predictive models with smaller carbon footprints. We directly follow the call to action of Tu et al. (2022) by providing more evi- dence and insights. Concretely, we use AutoML to find an improved plastic detector. To this end, AutoML aims to find machine learning (ML) pipelines automatically, which minimizes human effort and the need for expert knowl- edge (Hutter et al., 2019; Bischl et al., 2023). Most AutoML methods, such as Neural Architecture Search (NAS) (Elsken et al., 2019; White et al., 2023), train many models which are later discarded or super-networks with parts be- ing discarded, thus although the human effort is saved, the method in itself is fairly resource-intensive. The field of Green Artificial Intelligence reduces the energy consumption of machine learning models by taking the computa- tional cost into account as an evaluation measure (Schwartz et al., 2020). Green-AutoML combines these two objectives and aims at the best of both worlds. Previous research was mainly conducted in resource-aware NAS, often motivated by hardware constraints, e.g., to deploy models on the edge (Zhao et al., 2021; Benmeziane et al., 2021). However, recent research switched to a viewpoint 1We acknowledge personal communication with Wolf et al. (2020) who provided the dataset, the original model, and insights into the problem domain as well as the development process of the system. This helped us to identify important aspects that Green-AutoML can contribute to in this important application. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 of sustainability by aiming to reduce the carbon footprint of NAS, e.g., Bakhtiarifard et al. (2022) and Dou et al. (2023) created first energy-aware benchmarks for AutoML, unfortunately without any connection to climate-change relevant applications. The aim of this work is to use Green-AutoML to create an improved plastic litter detection system in terms of performance and energy consumption. The chosen method is Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS) (Pham et al., 2018). Although not considered state-of-the-art anymore, preliminary experiments with other NAS approaches showed that ENAS can still be considered one of the most efficient approaches and returns fairly small models. Moreover, the approach is compared to five well-established neural architectures a human ML expert might use to solve the problem without using AutoML. Finally, we show that while the chosen AutoML method is consuming more energy in the model construction phase, it is more sustainable at scale.
