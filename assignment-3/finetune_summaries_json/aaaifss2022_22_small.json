The TCFD recommendations, which have been officially endorsed by more than 3,400 companies worldwide to date, have become one of the most established standards for climate-related disclosures (Beyene, Ongena, and Delis 2022b). Such standards, while often non-binding, are intended to help companies, as well as investors and regulators, find common ground on the types of non-financial data to be disclosed, analyzed, and applied in investment decisions. The main focus of the TCFD recommendations lies on the integration of climate-related risks within companies. In this context, the TCFD relies on four disclosure categories (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, Metrics and Targets), which all deal with the integration and management of climate-related issues within companies.\n\nA growing body of empirical evidence emphasizes the importance of \"non-financial\" disclosures for a comprehensive assessment and management of climate-related risks by companies (Matsumura, Prakash, and Vera-Muñoz 2013; Ilhan, Sautner, and Vilkov 2020; Krueger, Sautner, and Starks 2020). Hence, an increasing number of investors have been exerting pressure on companies to issue reports that comply with TCFD recommendations. Recently, several countries, including the UK, Switzerland, and New Zealand, have taken steps to make TCFD reporting mandatory for large companies in their jurisdictions. On the other hand, a new strand of academic research emphasizes the current weaknesses of climate-related disclosures (e.g., greenwashing, lack of standardization, lack of quantitative data, and lack of transparency) and argues that such disclosures often fail to deliver on their promise of providing relevant information for decision-making (Bingler et al. 2022; Beyene, Ongena, and Delis 2022b). Most recently, a study investigated a sample of 818 TCFD-supporting firms from 2015 until 2020 and presented evidence that climate-related reporting is associated with selective disclosure, implying that firms tend to disclose information primarily on non-material TCFD categories (Bingler et al. 2022). In particular, the authors argue that the ineffectiveness of TCFD reporting is highlighted by the fact that reporting on \"Strategy\" as well as \"Metrics and Targets\" is generally quite limited, even though these two categories are the most material in the authors' eyes (Bingler et al. 2022).\n\nAs of today, research on climate-related disclosures remains very sparse.
