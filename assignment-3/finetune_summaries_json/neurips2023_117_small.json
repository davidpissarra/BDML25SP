In this work, we propose a new approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to estimate the effect of climate and remote sensing variables on poverty indicators measuring Education, Health, Living Standards, and Income. Furthermore, we use the trained models and perturbation analyses to identify the geographical regions most vulnerable to the potential variations in climate variables. 1 Introduction Climate change, a global exigency, affects not just the natural world but has profound socio-economic implications as well [ 1]. From altering agricultural outputs [ 2] to affecting public health [ 3,4], the tentacles of climate change reach far and wide. One such significant socio-economic metric affected by these changes is poverty [ 5,6]. Understanding this relationship and its extent can provide a foundation for creating informed policies that holistically address both the environment and socio- economic health [ 7]. By identifying areas with higher risk of falling into poverty from climate change we hope that we will help raise awareness and allow for preventative measures to be implemented. [ 8] While numerous studies have delved into poverty analysis using various indicators and surveys, few have leveraged extensive open climate data exclusively without any localized datasets[ 9,10,11,12]. This paucity becomes even more pronounced when one considers the application of methodologies like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for such an analysis. Furthermore, even though many works have explored the usage of machine learning models to predict poverty [ 13,14,15,16] few have attempted to clarify the relationships between the features used and the predicted poverty indexes. Our research fills this gap by systematically analyzing the relationship between open climate data and poverty indexes — leveraging state-of-the-art models, including GNNs and ensemble models, and explainability methods, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) [17]. ∗Also affiliated with DeepInvest & DeepVision Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2 Related Work In the quest to understand and predict poverty, traditional methodologies have predominantly leaned on socio-economic surveys, census data, and labor-intensive ground truthing processes [ 9,10,11,12]. While providing a detailed picture, these methods are time-consuming, resource-intensive, and can sometimes lag behind rapidly changing realities, particularly in developing nations where socio- economic conditions can swiftly fluctuate [18, 19, 20]. With the advent of data-driven methodologies, recent years have seen a surge in the application of machine learning models to predict poverty. Such endeavors often utilize private or localized datasets as features ranging from household surveys to mobile phone data [ 14,15,16]. However, while powerful, many of these datasets are region-specific, limiting their scalability across borders. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained prominence in various domains, from molecular chemistry [ 21] and social network analysis [ 22] to recommendation systems [ 23] and physical systems [ 24]. Their adaptability to dynamic regions of interest, size invariance, and scalability make them particularly suited for complex tasks [ 25,26,27,28] where the data have an inherent graph structure [23, 29]. Explainable AI (XAI) has emerged as a critical area of research, particularly in applications where understanding the decision-making process is as important as the decision itself [ 30,31,32,33]. Methods like LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) [ 34] and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) [ 17] have been employed to interpret complex models, providing insights into feature importance and decision rationale [ 35,36,37,38]. In the context of poverty prediction and climate factors, explainability can offer valuable insights into which variables are most influential, thereby guiding policy interventions more effectively [7, 39, 40, 41]. One paradigm within XAI that has shown promise is perturbation-based methods. These methods investigate the properties of machine learning models by altering the input in various ways—such as occluding part of an image or replacing a word in a sentence—and observing the resulting changes in the model’s output [ 42]. Perturbation-based methods have been applied across various data types, including images [ 43,44], videos [ 45,46], and natural language [ 47]. These methods offer several advantages: they provide an intuitive way to explore black-box models, allow for dynamic analysis, and are generally applicable to any models [42, 48]. t 3 Methodology 3.1 Data The primary dataset used in this study consists of open-access climate data obtained from various sources, including the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF), Copernicus Sentinel-2, MODIS, and more.
