Since icing events on turbine rotor blades are a leading cause of operational failures, identifying icing in advance is critical. Some recent studies focus on specific wind parks and fail to generalize to unseen scenarios (e.g. new rotor blade designs). We propose the utilisation of synthetic data augmentation via neural style transfer to improve the generalization of existing ice prediction models. We show that training models with augmented data that captures domain-invariant icing characteristics can help improve predictive performance across multiple wind parks. Through efficient identification of icing, this study can support preventive maintenance of wind energy sources by making them more reliable towards tackling climate change. 1 Introduction With a growing awareness of the pressing need to transition to renewable energy sources globally towards combating climate change, the total global installed wind power capacity has touched over 837 GW in 2022 [ 1]. Winters are generally considered to be highly promising for wind power generation, owing to higher wind speeds and increased air density accompanied with low prevailing temperatures [ 2]. However, some countries, particularly in Northern Europe and North America, are highly prone to icing conditions on the wind turbine rotor blades – leading to high stress on the overall structure of the turbines that prohibits their safe operation [ 3,4]. Such icing events not only give rise to unexpected downtimes, but also reduce the potential energy yield and shorten the mechanical lifetime of the turbines [ 5]. Most ice detection sensors mounted on rotor blades at present vary greatly in terms of their quality and are not sufficiently accurate [ 6,7]. Additionally, these approaches suffer from several drawbacks [ 6] – such as inability to provide direct ice measurements. As a potential solution, there has been a rising interest in leveraging colour images (RGB) of turbine rotor blades acquired through cameras installed on the nacelles and applying computer vision techniques for detecting ice accretion on the surface of the blades [ 8,9]. A camera generally captures images of the complete rotor blade even under harsh weather conditions (e.g. foggy environments), making this technique more robust than sensor-based approaches [ 10] and suitable for remote autonomous inspection [11]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2022.There has been very limited research in applying Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques for ice detection on rotor blades. Some studies [ 12,13,14,15,16] have utilised operational Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition to train conventional machine learning models (e.g. Decision Trees) as well as leveraged Deep Learning (DL) for ice detection. Only a few studies have applied DL for detecting icing based on image data [ 4,6]. While the existing studies have achieved near-perfect accuracy [ 4] with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), they are only effective in detecting icing on the rotor blades for the wind park from which the original training images were sourced. However, our experiments show that such models seem to perform poorly in generalizing to different wind parks – thus making them unsuitable for ice detection in new scenarios (e.g. with new rotor blade characteristics). We aim to tackle this challenge by facilitating domain adaptation – our goal is to ensure that a model trained on data from a specific wind park (source domain) is able to make effective predictions in new park locations (target domain). We propose the utilisation of synthetic data augmentation via neural style transfer with CNNs. The proposed method helps in the generation of synthetic images that can capture transferable fine-grained icing representations that are not bound to a specific wind park. By training the domain-specific models with the curated synthetic data, the generalizability of the models is improved towards detecting icing across different wind parks. This can help facilitate adoption of such domain-agnostic models across multiple wind parks in the near future for preventive maintenance of turbines, providing instrumental decision support for making wind turbines more reliable towards tackling climate change. 2 Dataset description and pre-processing For our study, we utilised RGB images recorded by cameras in two real-world wind parks – wind park A located in North America and wind park B located in Northern Europe. Note that the images acquired from wind park A are of significantly higher quality than wind park B owing to better camera quality and placement. The images were manually labelled into three classes by two humans (with cross-validation also performed between the labels) – no rotor blade on foreground, rotor blade without icing and rotor blade with icing. We experiment with both scenarios – wind park A as source domain and wind park B as target domain and vice versa. The training data of the base sets contains 150 background images, 20 rotor blade images plus 50 rotor blade images from the target domain and 70 icing images from the source domain. The rotor blade and ice images are augmented with up to 10% random rotation, reaching 400 images. The test data includes 200 images of each class for wind park A and 800 for wind park B. 3 Proposed\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
