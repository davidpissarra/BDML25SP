While some regulations are in place for preserving the Amazon against deforestation, these are being ﬂouted in various ways, hence the need to scale and automate the monitoring of cattle ranching activities. Through a partnership with Global Witness, we explore the feasibility of tracking and counting cattle at the continental scale from satellite imagery. With a license from Maxar Technologies, we obtained satellite imagery of the Amazon at 40cm resolution, and compiled a dataset of 903 images containing a total of 28498 cattle. Our experiments show promising results and highlight important directions for the next steps on both counting algorithms and the data collection process for solving such challenges. The code is available at https://github.com/IssamLaradji/cownter_strike. 1 Introduction With a population nearing 1 billion, cattle are the 2nd most populous mammal on earth, after humans. Cattle farming produces 8.8% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide [ 8]1. Besides the methane released due to digestion process of cattle, the industry demands massive regions to be deforested to make space for the grazing areas. Deforestation releases most carbon stored in the forest, it displaces indigenous communities and species, and the resulting lack of biodiversity threatens to disrupt the ecosystem. The lack of rainforests compounds the effects of global warming, and further accelerates the ongoing 6th mass extinction of species [4, 5, 21, 29]. One of the most important areas affected is the Brazilian Amazon. It is estimated that 70% of its cleared forests are now populated by cattle, ranking Brazil’s herd as the 2nd largest in the world. Despite strict laws in Brazil against the rearing and selling of cattle in protected areas of the Amazon, these are widely ﬂouted. A common workaround to the current legislation is through smuggling the cattle to the southern grasslands, where they are declared and slaughtered in a legal area. The cattle laundering network shields cattle rearing from the law even in protected regions of the Amazon, which has been further diminished by wildﬁres triggered to expand the grazing areas. This trend calls for an automated scalable way to monitor against illegal cattle ranching, a task that we show to be feasible through high-res satellite images and recent advances in deep learning. Adult cattle span 2 meters, so to achieve a reliable detection we require satellite imagery at sub-meter resolution. This could be achieved with drone imagery, but with a limited range they would be too 1In its 2013 report, the Food and Agriculture Organization [ 8] estimates that the livestock industry accounts for 14.5% of anthropogenic green house gas emissions, to which, beef and dairy production contribute 40% and 21% respectively.

On the other hand, modern satellites can be tasked for multiple, ad-hoc revisits and their on-board cameras can now resolve objects at the sub-meter level (for example, WorldView3 and SkySat constellations). In this paper we use WorldView3 (Maxar) imagery of Amazon ranches, with panchromatic (PAN) and multi-spectral (MUL) bands at 0.31 and 1.24 m/pixel respectively. Typically, MUL bands are already pan-sharpened to the panchromatic resolution. The acquisitions from WorldView3 are task-based, so coverage can be sparse temporally and spatially, but since August 2014 most areas of the rainforest were covered a few times. 2 Related Work Our work touches on several fronts - remote sensing applied to animal conservation, localization and counting methods in ML, and environmental / human rights issues driven by deforestation. Remote sensing of cattle and other animals Most of the work on the tracking and counting of animals and other small objects relies mostly on UA V/drone images [ 22,31]. On cattle detection, CNNs trained with UA V images can be effective in detection [ 23,2] and counting [ 31,26,3]. Animals of similar size, like wildebeest, can be counted from UA V images [ 27], and even animals as small as sheep [ 30]. Satellite images have been broadly used for animal conservation. Namely, WorldView2 panchromatic 50cm imagery was used to count yaks [ 32,30]. However, satellite cameras hit a limit when it comes to resolving animals as small as a sheep [ 30].
