Renovation works and retroﬁtting are essential to progress towards highly-efﬁcient buildings, and to be effective, they must be accompanied by suitable operation protocols [ 22]. As a matter of fact, selecting optimal setpoints and deadbands for HV AC control could alone lead to energy savings up to 35% while maintaining occupants’ comfort [ 12]. Nevertheless, most state-of-the-art technologies for automatic control cannot achieve these ﬁgures [24], and those successful require a considerable effort to be adapted to different scenarios [4]. The overarching objective of this research initiative —namely IA4SG (Intelligent Agents for the Smart Grid)— is to create the technologies supporting the smart energy control of the future building ecosystem. Machine Learning has a tremendous potential to achieve great energy savings, reduce contaminant emissions and make the best use of renewable resources at an affordable cost for the building owners and residents [ 29]. We envision a future energy system in which building control will be performed by autonomous self-adaptive agents that, with minimal conﬁguration, will learn how to operate the HV AC equipment more efﬁciently and how to collaborate with other actors of the grid. To this aim, we pursue to develop new Deep Learning and Reinforcement Learning methods, algorithms and tools to address three key issues: (A) generation of optimal control instructions for HV AC to save energy while guaranteeing comfort; (B) simulation of buildings under different operations and contexts; (C) coordination between components of the energy system to achieve an overall reduction of the contaminant emissions. The concept behind IA4SG is shown in Figure 1: A.Control optimization by Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL): From the game board to the building. An IA4SG agent teaches itself to efﬁciently operate the building from multiple “trial and error” episodes, as AlphaZero did [ 30]. Since the agent requires a considerable number of episodes to reﬁne its skills, collection of such experience is not only performed on the real building, but also on a simulation model (see B). This process is more complex if the agent has capabilities for energy production and storage, which at the same time offers more possibilities for improvement. Once the agent is trained, it can be deployed to operate the building and updated as the scenario evolves. Preliminary works —-using hypothetical simple building models with a reduced action space [ 2,34,38]–– suggest that HV AC control with DRL is feasible and has potential to dramatically transform the area, since it would overcome scalability limitations of similar control approaches based on data-driven simulation [36]. B.Deep neural simulation models (DNSM): Learning and predicting the building behaviour from data. Instead of using a manually-crafted physical simulation model, the IA4SG agent automatically learns a digital twin of the real building from historical sensor data. The simulation model can be re-calibrated from live data. Learning is not performed from scratch, but by reusing simulation models created for other scenarios (i.e. by performing transfer learning). Shallow neural networks have been previously used to create data-driven simulation models, but only to estimate consumption (not the whole environment state) at a microscale (not for a large section of the building) [ 35]. Recently deep neural networks have proved to be useful to model single HV AC components and simulate short-term thermal behavior [6, 10, 21]. 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.Figure 1: IA4SG concept C.Cooperation among multiple energy system actors: Leveraging agent cliques to federa- tions. An IA4SG agent cooperates with other agents in the energy system to trade energy in order to maximize the overall use of clean energies in the whole grid. Each agent describes and publishes its capabilities, resources and objectives, and after been trained to interact with other agents, it is ready to negotiate energy acquisition and sharing by following established protocols. Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) have been proposed before as a suitable technology to manage different aspects of power systems [ 25] and buildings [ 20], given their capabilities for autonomous organization, semantic interoperability, and system scalability.

Traditionally, agents’ interaction has been implemented by means of a formal speciﬁcation of their operational cycle [ 8]. More recently, optimization methods based on dynamic programming, games theory, and heuristic search have shown better use of energy, although most of them have still a centralized supervisory control which reduces the ﬂexibility of the grid [ 39].
