If prediction error in the outcome variable is correlated with policy variables or important confounders, as is the case for many widely used remote sensing data sets, estimates of the causal impacts of policies can be biased. In this paper, we demonstrate how this bias can arise, and we propose the use of an adversarial debiasing model (Zhang, Lemoine, and Mitchell 2018) in order to correct the issue when using satellite data to generate machine learning predictions for use in causal inference. We apply this method to a case study of the relationship between roads and tree cover in West Africa, where our results indicate that adversarial debiasing can recover a much more accurate estimate of the parameter of interest compared to when the standard approach is used. 1 Introduction Advances in machine learning and the increasing availability of satellite imagery have catalyzed the use of remotely sensed measures of human activity or environmental outcomes in research seeking to infer environmental policy impacts. The effort required to directly observe and collect outcome data on-the-ground may be prohibitively expensive or time- consuming. Remote sensing, particularly via satellite imaging, offers a huge opportunity for measuring outcomes at a much lower cost and time investment to researchers. This is especially applicable to those developing and testing interventions to mitigate the causes and effects of climate change, which frequently need to be evaluated at large spatial scales across the globe and in remote locations that are not easily accessible. To translate satellite imagery to manageable representations of outcomes, researchers typically take a small number of images that have been hand-labeled or cross-referenced with on-the- ground measurements, and use them to train various machine learning models to predict the desired variable (for example, proportion of tree cover). Once these models have been trained, they can be deployed on a much larger set of images to obtain outcome predictions at all points of interest, requiring only a fraction of the data used for impact evaluation to be manually labelled or collected. ∗Corresponding author ( m.ayers@yale.edu ) 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 A common application of these machine learned predictions for impact evaluation is to use causal inference techniques to estimate the effect of an intervention, or “treatment,\" on the outcome of interest. One of the assumptions made within the standard causal inference framework is that there are no unobserved variables that “confound\" the relationship between the treatment and outcome by depending on or influencing both the treatment and outcome variables. When using predictions from remote sensing methods as outcome values for standard causal inference techniques, the relevant assumption then applies to the outcome predictions, not the ground-truth outcomes that are generally unobservable (see examples of these relationships in Figure 1). Even in a randomized controlled trial where researchers have full control over a randomized treatment assignment mechanism, it is possible for this assumption to be violated if the assignment of treatment influences the outcome prediction error. For example, imagine a randomized experiment where treatment (perhaps a carbon credit) inadvertently increases nearby manufacturing and thereby air pollution. If increased levels of air pollution result in systematic under-predictions of the outcome of interest, then there is a problematic depen- dency between the prediction error and the treatment. In non-experimentally randomized settings, opportunities for dependencies between the treatment mechanism and outcome prediction error proliferate, related to common concerns about confounding variables and ignorability in observational studies. Suppose that we want to understand the impact of building roads on deforestation. Roads tend not to be built on steep slopes, where remote sensing methods also tend to over-predict tree cover. The effect of slope on tree cover prediction error may be misattributed to being far from roads, in this case. To remove potential dependencies of this nature from remotely sensed outcome predictions, we propose the use of an adversarial debiasing model, inspired by prior work in algorithmic fairness (Zhang, Lemoine, and Mitchell 2018, Celis and Keswani 2019). Adversarial debiasing has been used in this field to ensure that algorithms do not make systematically inaccurate predictions on the basis of race or gender. Our approach adapts this tactic to generate satellite-derived measures that are unbiased for true outcome values across the range of the treatment variable, improving the accuracy of downstream estimation procedures for impact evaluation. With the use of a hand-labeled data set of forest cover in West Africa (Bastin et al. 2017), we demonstrate the usefulness of this method as a means of obtaining accurate estimates of policy-relevant parameters in cases where standard methods fail. 2 Related work Recently, other studies have pointed out cases of systematic prediction errors in a variety of remotely sensed variables.
