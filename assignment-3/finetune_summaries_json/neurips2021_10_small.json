Our framework, which we refer to as Hurricast (HURR), is built upon the combination of distinct data processing techniques using gradient-boosted trees and novel encoder-decoder architectures, including CNN, GRU and Transformers components. We propose a deep-learning feature extractor methodology to mix spatial-temporal data with statistical data efﬁciently. Our multimodal framework unleashes the potential of making forecasts based on a wide range of data sources, including historical storm data, and visual data such as reanalysis atmospheric images. We evaluate our models with current operational forecasts in North Atlantic (NA) and Eastern Paciﬁc (EP) basins on 2016-2019 for 24-hour lead time, and show our models consistently outperform statistical-dynamical models and compete with the best dynamical models. Furthermore, the inclusion of Hurricast into an operational forecast consensus model leads to a signiﬁcant improvement of 5% - 15% over NHC’s ofﬁcial forecast, thus highlighting the complementary properties with existing approaches. 1 Introduction A tropical cyclone (TC) is a low-pressure system originating from tropical or subtropical waters and developing by drawing energy from the sea. It is characterized by a warm core, organized deep convection and a closed surface wind circulation about a well-deﬁned center. TCs draw energy from the warm ocean waters, and releases energy through heavy rainfall. There is growing evidence suggesting consistent hurricane intensity escalation due to climate change and warmer ocean waters [ 8]. For example, the recent storm Ida unexpectedly intensiﬁed more than the National Hurricane Center (NHC)’s forecast, strengthening rapidly overnight. Therefore, producing an accurate prediction for TC track and intensity with sufﬁcient lead time is critical to undertake life-saving measures, and there is a need for new forecasting methodologies that can learn from the data directly. Most forecasting models focus on producing track (trajectory) forecasting and intensity (such as the maximum sustained wind speed) forecasting. Current operational TC forecasts can be classiﬁed into dynamical models, statistical models and statistical-dynamical models [ 13]. Dynamical models utilize powerful supercomputers to simulate atmospheric ﬁelds’ evolution using sophisticated physically-motivated dynamical equations. Statistical models approximate historical relationships between storm behavior and storm-speciﬁc features. Statistical- dynamical models use statistical techniques but further includes atmospheric variables provided by dynamical models. Lastly, ensemble models, also known as consensus forecasts, combine the forecasts made by individual models or multiple runs of a single model. Recent developments in Deep Learning (DL) enable ML models to employ multiple data processing techniques to process and combine information from a wide range of sources, and create sophisticated architectures to model spatial-temporal relationships. Several studies have demonstrated the use of Recurrent Neural Networks to predict TC trajectory based on historical data [ 10,1,5]. In addition, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have also been applied to process reanalysis data and satellite data for track forecasting [ 9,6,11] and storm intensiﬁcation forecasting [2, 15].
