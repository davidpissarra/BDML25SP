To address this limitation, we propose to annotate benthic images using hierarchical classification. Experiments on a custom dataset from a Northeast Brazilian coral reef show that our approach outperforms flat classifiers, improving both F1 and hierarchical F1 scores by approximately 2% across varying amounts of training data. In addition, this hierarchical method aligns more closely with ecological objectives. 1 Introduction Coral reefs host around 25% of global marine species [ 1] and provide vital ecosystem services for coastal populations, including maintaining fish stocks, protecting shorelines from waves, and fostering tourism [ 2]. Despite their importance, these ecosystems are facing unprecedented threats from climate change [ 3] as illustrated by the increasing frequency of coral bleaching events [ 4]. In response to these challenges, comprehensive coral reef surveying and monitoring have become essential for implementing appropriate and timely conservation actions [5]. Benthic monitoring focuses on measuring seafloor coverage by various organisms, especially corals [ 6]. Over the past decades, monitoring programs have shifted from direct underwater measure- ments to photographic methods [ 7], creating lasting records and significantly reducing underwater time. Traditionally, collected images were annotated manually using specialized software, involving sampling random points and labeling them with their benthic categories (Figure 1). These annotations serve to calculate cover proportions, which are essential for coral monitoring. However, manual annotation is time-consuming, which can delay the availability of survey results, and can introduce bias due to differences between analysts [ 8]. To address this, platforms like CoralNet [ 9] use deep learning for automatic annotation [ 10]. Small pixel patches (typically 224x224) are extracted around each point and the problem of point annotation is addressed as an image classification task (Figure 1). This way, ecologists only need to manually annotate a small subset of images, which are used to train a neural network capable of automatically annotating the remaining images. During our collaboration between data scientists and marine ecologists, we identified a misalignment between Machine Learning (ML) approaches and ecological needs. Current models use detailed labels encompassing various taxonomic levels and coral health status. For instance, a point labeled as “Bleached Palythoa\" simultaneously conveys information about coral type, genus, and health status (Figure 2). However, in practice, ecologists often need to aggregate these labels differently to compute cover proportions of macro groups, e.g., grouping all corals regardless of species or health. Flat classification presents challenges for underrepresented categories, which often lack sufficient labeled data for accurate classification at such a high level of detail. To address this issue, we Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: Benthic image annotation process – A predetermined number of random points are sampled within a fixed area and annotated with the corresponding organism or substrate. The relative frequencies are used as proxies for cover proportions of benthic categories within the sampled area. investigate the application of Hierarchical Classification (HC) [ 11] to benthic image annotation, a novel approach in this field. This multi-level prediction strategy has the potential to improve performance by allowing partially correct predictions. Furthermore, we argue that evaluating model performance with hierarchical metrics [ 12] would more accurately reflect real-world ecological practices. By aligning our approach with the inherent hierarchical structure of benthic organisms, we aim to enhance both the performance and ecological relevance of automated coral reef monitoring. 2 Methodology Hierarchical Classification (HC) consists in organizing classes into a hierarchy, represented as a tree [ 13,11] (Figure 2). This structure reflects the natural relationships between classes, with general categories at higher levels and specific subcategories at lower levels. Two main approaches exist: local approaches, often called “top-down\", train separate classifiers for each node of the hierarchy, while global approaches build a single, comprehensive model considering the entire hierarchy simultaneously. In this paper, we evaluate the potential of top-down HC for benthic image annotation. 2.1 Building the Hierachy Implementing HC for coral images requires a paradigm shift in how the label set is designed. Marine ecologists must establish a classification tree representing the taxonomic hierarchy, rather than a flat set of labels. Building an HC tree requires answering several design questions: Can a prediction be composed of multiple labels? Can multiple path lead to the same label? Can predictions stop at intermediate nodes? As the goal of this work is to validate the relevance of HC for benthic image annotation, we choose the most simple tree design possible where the final prediction is always a single leaf node, and there is only one path to each label. The tree (Appendix A) was designed in a collaboration between an ML expert and a marine ecologist to ensure both computational constraints and biological relevance are respected.
