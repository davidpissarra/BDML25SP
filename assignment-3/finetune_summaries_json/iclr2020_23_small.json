Deforestation does not only release carbon (e.g., through slash-and-burn), but also destroys a multitude of other forest ecosystem services: preserving biodiversity, counteracting ﬂooding and soil erosion, ﬁltering water, and offering a livelihood for the local population. The causes of deforestation are mostly economically driven: expansion of commercial or subsis- tence agriculture, logging, fuelwood collection, or livestock grazing (Hosonuma et al., 2012)). To counteract the economic incentives, payments for ecosystem services (PES) (Wunder, 2007) are increasingly (Donofrio et al., 2019) provided to forest conserving or restoring landowners by inter- national stakeholders (e.g., through the governmental UN-REDD program (Gibbs et al., 2007) or the commercial voluntary carbon market (Donofrio et al., 2019)). However, current methods for monitoring, reporting, and veriﬁcation (MRV) of the landowner-provided forest ecosystem services are either based on 1) on-ground inspection, which is too expensive (USD 20-30k), delayed (up to two years), corruptible, and biased (Gold Standard, 2017), 2) satellite, which is low-cost, but limited to the binary veriﬁcation of forest/no-forest cover (Hansen et al., 2013), or 3) drones. Recent works haved proposed low-cost and accurate MRV via drones (Dao et al., 2019b;a; L ¨utjens et al., 2019). Speciﬁcally, these works propose algorithms that estimate forest ecosystem services (e.g., stored forest carbon) from drone imagery that was reported by landowners.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nCarbon emissions can be reduced, for example, by issuing payments for ecosystem services (PES) to forest conservation projects. Issuing trusted payments requires a transparent monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV) process of the ecosystem services, such as carbon stored in forests. The current MRV process is either too expensive (on-ground inspection of forest) or inaccurate (satellite). Recent works propose low-cost and accurate MRV via automatically determining forest carbon from drone imagery collected by landowners. However, the automation of MRV opens up the possibility that landowners report untruthful drone imagery. To address this, we propose a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the truthfulness of drone imagery from forest conservation projects by matching it with public satellite imagery.\n\nPreliminary results suggest that nominal distance metrics are not sufficient to reliably detect untruthfully reported imagery. Our method uses metric learning to create a feature embedding in which truthfully and untruthfully collected imagery is easily distinguishable by distance thresholding.\n\nAgriculture, forestry, and other land use is a key driver of climate change, accounting for 23% of total anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases during 2007-2016 (IPCC, 2019). Deforestation not only releases carbon but also destroys a multitude of other forest ecosystem services, including preserving biodiversity, counteracting flooding and soil erosion, filtering water, and providing a livelihood for the local population. The causes of deforestation are mostly economically driven, including expansion of commercial or subsistence agriculture, logging, fuelwood collection, or livestock grazing (Hosonuma et al., 2012).\n\nTo counteract the economic incentives, payments for ecosystem services (PES) are provided to forest conserving or restoring landowners by international stakeholders (Wunder, 2007; Donofrio et al., 2019).

Recent works have proposed low-cost and accurate MRV via drones (Dao et al., 2019b; Lütjens et al., 2019). These works propose algorithms that estimate forest ecosystem services (e.g., stored forest carbon) from drone imagery reported by landowners. However, replacing on-ground inspection with remote assessment via drones opens up the possibility of untruthfully reported imagery.\n\nGiven that landowners are financially incentivized by PES to report higher forest ecosystem services value, the possibility of false reporting is high. We hypothesize that landowners could report untruthful imagery by altering the image in location, time, or with adversarial perturbation (e.g., via PGD (Madry et al., 2018)). We propose TrueBranch, a metric learning-based algorithm that verifies the trustworthiness of reported drone imagery of forest conservation projects. Specifically, TrueBranch aims to detect untruthfully reported imagery by matching it with public satellite imagery."
