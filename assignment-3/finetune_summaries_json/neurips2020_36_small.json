Our proposed detec- tion system identiﬁes ﬁsh instances using DL- based frameworks, determines trajectory tracks, derives novel behavior-speciﬁc features, and em- ploys Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) net- works to identify startle behavior in sableﬁsh. Its performance is studied by comparing it with a state-of-the-art DL-based video event detector. 1. Introduction Among the negative impacts of climate change in marine ecosystems predicted for global warming levels of 1:5\u000eC to 2\u000eC (e.g. signiﬁcant global mean sea level rise [ 1], sea-ice- free Artic Oceans [ 2], interruption of ocean-based services) are the acidiﬁcation and temperature rise of waters. The behavioral disturbance in ﬁsh species resulting from climate change can be studied with the use of underwater optical systems, which have become increasingly prevalent over the last six decades [ 3,4,5]. However, advancements in automated video processing methodologies have not kept pace with advances in the video technology itself. The manual interpretation of visual data requires prohibitive amounts of time, highlighting the necessity of semi- and fully-automated methods for the enhancement [ 6,7] and annotation of marine imagery. 1University of Victoria, BC, Canada2Biology Department, University of Victoria, BC, Canada3Ocean Networks Canada, BC, Canada.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at the34thConference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020).As a result, the ﬁeld of automatic interpretation of underwa- ter imagery for biological purposes has experienced a surge of activity in the last decade [ 8]. While numerous works propose the automatic detection and counting of specimen [9,10,11], ecological applications require more complex insights. Video data provides critical information on ﬁsh be- havior and interactions such as predation events, aggressive interactions between individuals, activities related to repro- duction and startle responses. The ability to detect such behavior represents an important shift in the semantic rich- ness of data and scientiﬁc value of computer vision-based analysis of underwater videos: from the focused detection and counting of individual specimens, to the context-aware identiﬁcation of ﬁsh behavior. Given the heterogeneous visual appearance of diverse be- haviors observed in ﬁsh, we initially focus our study on a particular target: startle motion patterns observed in sable- ﬁsh ( Anoplopoma ﬁmbria ). Such behavior is characterized by sudden changes in the speed and trajectory of sableﬁsh movement tracks. We propose a novel end-to-end behavior detection frame- work that considers 4-second clips to 1) detect the presence of sableﬁsh using DL-based object detectors [ 12]; 2) uses the Hungarian algorithm [ 13] to determine trajectory tracks between subsequent frames; 3) measures four handcrafted and behavior-speciﬁc features and 4) employs such features in conjunction with LSTM networks [ 14] to determine the presence of startle behavior and describe it ( i.e. travelling direction, speed, and trajectory). The remainder of this arti- cle is structured as follows. In Section 2 we discuss works of relevance to the proposed system. Section 3 describes the proposed approach. In Section 4 we present a dataset of sableﬁsh startle behaviors and use it to compare the per- formance of our system with that of a state-of-the-art event detector [ 15].
