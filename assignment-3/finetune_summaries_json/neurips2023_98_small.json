To limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5◦C, the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change (IPCC) states that the transportation industry must decrease their CO 2emissions to 2.6 GtCO 2by 2050 [3]. Road freight transportation emitted 2.2 GtCO 2globally in 20202. Yet, under currently implemented and announced policies, the International Transport Forum expects road freight transportation emis- sions to increase to 2.5 GtCO 2in 2050 – single-handedly exhausting almost all of the transportation industry’s carbon budget. In addition, road freight transportation is seen as one of the most difficult industries to decarbonise [ 5]. This is due to the sheer weights and distances travelled. In 2020, global road freight activity was at 26.8 trillion tonne-kilometers3. This is expected to double by 2050 due to an increasing global population and global economic growth [1]. One approach to decarbonise road freight transportation is through cooperation. Cooperative vehicle routing studies the setting where delivery companies share their delivery information and perform deliveries on behalf of one another. An illustration can be found in Figure 1. Cooperative vehicle routing has been studied in operations research for at least two decades, with estimated cost savings between 4-46% [ 6,7,8,9,10]. Cooperative vehicle routing results in reduced distance travelled by trucks, thus reducing carbon emissions and road congestion. In addition, delivery companies can increase their revenue, improve customer service, and gain market share [ 9]. Surprisingly, despite the abundance of perceived benefits, cooperative vehicle routing has still not seen widespread industrial traction [8]. We argue that this is due to a lack of fairandscalable algorithms for gain sharing, i.e., if two or more companies cooperate, how much should everyone be fairly paid? Fairness is important to 1Transportation involves the movement of people and goods across air, road, rail and water. 2Due to COVID-19, global freight activity dropped by 4%, but global freight emissions only dropped by 1% due to increased urban deliveries [4, p. 194]. 3A tonne-kilometer is when a tonne of goods is transported one kilometer.

Cooperative game theory allows us to study fair gain sharing in a principled manner and has been widely applied to cooperative logistics [ 6,11].
