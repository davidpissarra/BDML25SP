This practice is particularly prevalent in agricultural regions across the world, though its impacts are notably severe in the northern India. This proposed work focuses on improving the detection of stubble (crop residue) burning in Punjab (India), using geospatial foundation model. This study leverages series of satellite images where stubble burning incidents have been documented. By refining the model to incorporate local environmental factors, this study aims to improve the accuracy of stubble burning detection, thereby contributing to a scalable solution for real-time monitoring and intervention in crop residue burning practices worldwide. 1 Introduction Stubble (Crop residue) [1], [2] burning is a widespread practice in agricultural regions across the world [3]–[6] particularly in Punjab, northern India (Figure 1)[7]–[9], where it is predominantly used to rapidly clear crop residues during the months of October and November. Despite its convenience for farmers, this practice has severe environmental consequences, including deteriorating air quality, soil degradation, and adverse health effects across northern India [10]–[13], including New Delhi [14]–[16]. Total emissions of carbon dioxide (CO 2) sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitric oxide (NO x), carbon monoxide (CO), PM 2.5, PM 10etc. from crop residue burning are quantified by [17] using statistical models combined with satellite observations and sensors. A Detailed study on the impact of stubble burning on climate change is provided in [18], [19], while satellite-based methods have been used Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.to monitor and detect stubble burning [20]–[22]. Similarly, in [23] Sentinel-2 data and Random Forest classifiers were used to map stubble burning, demonstrating the potential of integrating spectral indices such as NDVI [24] and NBR [25]. However, these methods often lack regional adaptability and precision, limiting their overall effectiveness. Recent advancements in remote sensing and machine learning have led to more accurate detection and monitoring of stubble burning. [26], [27]) A CNN-based deep learning framework was used to monitor active fire locations with high-resolution satellite imagery, significantly improving burn scar detection accuracy compared to traditional methods [28]. Fine-tuning pre-trained Earth observation models for regional applications enhances performance, achieving state-of-the-art results in land cover classification [29]. Transfer learning and adaptive strategies, as explored by [30], [31], are crucial for effectively fine-tuning geospatial models.This study aligns with these goals by fine-tuning the Prithvi-100m geospatial foundation model [32], [33] for the Punjab region to enhance stubble burning detection, utilizing a dataset of 1,500 coordinate points to improve regional specificity and detection accuracy. The Prithvi-100m-burn-scars model [34], further fine-tuned on the extensive HLS Burn Scar Scenes dataset [35], marks a significant advancement in burn scar detection. By leveraging this model on high-resolution satellite images [36] and a customized regional dataset (Punjab, India), stubble burning detection methods can be tailored to local environmental conditions. The proposed approach aims to offer a scalable solution for real-time monitoring and intervention in stubble burning practices worldwide. Accurate monitoring of stubble burning can significantly aid in crop residue management and reduce its environmental consequences, as discussed in [37]–[39]. 2 Dataset and Preprocessing The dataset1consists of 1,500 data points (latitude, longitude, date of observation) from Punjab, India, representing locations where active fires or stubble burning incidents were reported, as shown in Figure 2. Manual polygonization can be used to annotate fields on satellite images for the corresponding stubble burning observation dates. The recommended geospatial foundation model requires six bands (blue, green, red, narrow NIR, SWIR 1, and SWIR 2) compatible with Sentinel-2 (20m resolution) and a 5- to 6-day revisit time. Figure 1: Stubble burning in rice field  Figure 2: 1,500 Ground truth data points Sentinel-2 (L2A) products [40] offer freely accessible surface reflectance data, making them a cost-effective alternative to commercial datasets like PlanetScope. While Sentinel-2 has a lower spatial resolution (10 meters) and a 5-day revisit time compared to PlanetScope’s higher resolution (around 3 meters) and daily revisit capability, its free and open access is invaluable for large-scale and long-term monitoring. To correct atmospheric effects in our 2015 data, recorded before Sentinel-2 L2A products became available in 2018, we applied the Sen2Cor processor [41] to the Level-1C data\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
