While some machine learning models have been adopted by the SDM community, recent advances in neural networks may have untapped poten- tial in this field. In this work, we compare the performance of multi-layer percep- tron (MLP) neural networks to well-established SDM methods on a benchmark dataset spanning 225 species in six geographical regions. We also compare the performance of MLPs trained separately for each species to an equivalent model trained on a set of species and performing multi-label classification. Our results show that MLP models achieve comparable results to state-of-the-art SDM meth- ods, such as MaxEnt. We also find that multi-species MLPs perform slightly better than single-species MLPs. This study indicates that neural networks, along with all their convenient and valuable characteristics, are worth considering for SDMs. 1 I NTRODUCTION Describing and understanding the geographic distribution and environmental suitability of species is a central question in ecology and biogeography. It has become increasingly meaningful in the face of anthropogenic pressure on biodiversity (Barnosky et al., 2011) and has occasioned the devel- opment of species distribution models (SDMs)1. Such models relate species occurrence data with environmental variables and are used to understand and predict species’ distributions across land- scapes (Elith and Leathwick, 2009). Such predictions may allow the identification of areas likely to be invaded by non-native species (Thuiller et al., 2005b), the forecast of shifts in distribution due to climate change (Thuiller et al., 2005a), or the selection of field survey areas to speed up the dis- covery of a new population of a species (Fois et al., 2015). SDMs can therefore be used to support decision-making for species conservation (Guisan et al., 2013) and prevent biodiversity loss, which is generally beneficial for the climate as shown by Shin et al. (2022). However, species occurrence data used for SDMs are expensive and complicated to collect. Datasets are typically small, especially for rare species and in regions that are less well-researched, restricting their predictive power and making them difficult to transfer to other regions. These datasets con- sist of either presence-absence data from systematic field surveys, or presence-only data, which is easier to collect and more widely available, especially with crowdsourcing initiatives such as iNat- uralist (Van Horn et al., 2018) or Pl@ntNet (Joly et al., 2016). When using presence-only data, pseudo-absences orbackground points may be generated (randomly or according to specific sam- pling strategies) and used as negative samples in the model (Phillips et al., 2009). ∗Indicates equal contribution 1It should be noted that many names exist for this type of model. In some contexts, ecological niche model may be more appropriate to refer to these types of models (Peterson and Sober ´on, 2012). For simplicity, we will use the term species distribution model. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 101102103104 #occurrences01020304050species countTrain set region AWT CAN NSW NZ SA SWI 101102103104 #occurrences01020304050T est set Figure 1: Number of occurrences per species in the training and test set for each region. The x-axis is logarithmic. The two distributions are quite different, but both follow a long-tailed distribution. Well-established methods for SDMs are adapted to the customarily small datasets and include sim- ple statistical models, such as generalized linear models (GLMs) and generalized additive models (GAMs), as well as machine learning methods like random forests, support vector machines, and MaxEnt (Phillips et al., 2017; Zhang and Li, 2017; Valavi et al., 2022). Generally, species are mod- eled independently of each other, despite the fact that biotic interactions shape species’ distributions at local scales (Wisz et al., 2013). Deep learning methods are revolutionizing ecological modeling (Tuia et al., 2022) and might be particularly suitable in an SDM context: they can model highly non-linear relationships between environmental variables and distributions, and can elegantly model multiple species at once. Hence, with the growing amount of available data, deep learning algo- rithms for SDMs have begun to be explored (Botella et al., 2018; Deneu et al., 2021; Lorieul et al., 2022), but are far from being standardized in the field of ecology.
