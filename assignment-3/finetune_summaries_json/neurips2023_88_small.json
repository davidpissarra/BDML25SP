At present, these rely on sparse cross-correlation estimates as well as computationally expensive optical flow solutions. Here we present a novel use of deep-learning for estimating annual glacier velocities, utilizing the recurrent optical-flow based architecture, RAFT, on consecutive pairs of optical Sentinel-2 imagery. Our results highlight that deep learning can generate dense per-pixel velocity estimates within an automated framework that utilizes Sentinel-2 images over the French Alps. 1 Introduction The evolution of glaciers is widely regarded as a significant indicator of climate change [ 1]. These systems play a crucial role in global mean sea level rise, contributing as much as 25–30% over past decades [ 2,3]. This, in addition to the increased frequency of natural hazards affecting mountainous communities and evolving local hydrology, motivate the need for improved glacier monitoring [ 4–6]. Advancements made in spaceborne remote sensing capabilities have led to enhanced data availability with higher spatial resolution and lower revisit times. Glacier surface displacements can be inferred from successive optical or radar remote sensing images through feature tracking algorithms based on cross-correlation and optical flow techniques. A range of toolboxes have been developed with end-to-end workflows for feature tracking, utilizing these classical algorithms [ 7]. Efforts have been made to produce databases mapping glacier surface velocities at regional and global scales from archives of Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery [8, 9]. Recently, deep learning computer vision algorithms have been effective at learning velocity fields from series of images, producing state-of-the-art optical flow estimation across synthetic datasets and fluid flow estimation problems [ 10,11]. Deep learning for glacier monitoring has been applied to the mapping of glacier extents, glacier debris classification and mapping glacial lakes from remote sensing images [ 12–16]. However, it remains to be fully investigated the efficacy of deep learning optical flow methods for inferring glacier velocity fields, despite the adoption of these methods across various domains. Therefore, here we present a novel use of deep learning for mapping glacier-scale velocity fields from remote sensing imagery.

(RAFT) based architecture to estimate dense optical flow velocity fields from Sentinel-2 imagery [17, 18]. 2 Methodology 2.1 Workflow In order to investigate the viability of deep learning based glacier image velocimetry, Sentinel-2 images need to be processed for input to the RAFT model, as well as target velocity fields generated for supervised learning. The employed data processing pipeline used to generate the training and test datasets is similar to the automated framework proposed by Millan et al. for generating glacier velocities from multiple spaceborne imaging platforms [ 19]. All available Sentinel-2 images over the region of interest are downloaded in Google Earth Engine. Since the images are optical, the search query is filtered by cloud cover, with winter months dominated by snowfall and homogeneous surface texture avoided. The near infrared band, Sentinel-2 band 8, is judged to produce sufficient radiometric response and is therefore the single band utilized here for analysis. The downloaded images are then Sobel-filtered in both the xandydirections to enhance contrast and mitigate against shadows caused by the complex topography in mountainous regions. Glacier outlines from the Randolf Glacier Inventory are used to generate image masks to remove non-glacierized regions ahead of velocity estimation [ 20]. The processed images are then combined into image pairs and segmented into overlapping tiles of size 256 ×256, which is the input size of the RAFT model. Data augmentation is performed on the input images using rotations to modify dataset size and improve robustness. Training labels are generated from a classical multi-level Horn-Schunk solution implemented in Matlab which produces dense per-pixel velocity fields for the image pairs [21]. The resulting velocity fields are filtered for outliers using a 9 ×9 median filter. 2.2 Study Site The selected glacier of interest, shown in Figure 1, is the Mer de Glace of the Mont Blanc massif in the French Alps, occupying an area of ∼30 km2.
