Our model takes a probabilistic view on 7 ET datasets and their correction that we use to regress catchment-level residuals 8 using a sum-aggregated supervision. Using four global ET datasets, we show that 9 our learned model has learned ET corrections that accurately generalize its water 10 cycle-closure results to unseen catchments. 11 1 Introduction 12 In the context of Climate Change (CC), the demand on water resources is increasing as both flood 13 and drought related damages increase. Human activities are known to impact the global water 14 cycle. However observational uncertainties limit extreme hazard forecast capability and render 15 human contribution to CC trend estimates very challenging in the context of high natural climate 16 variability [1]. The main evidence of observational uncertainties and discrepancy in monitoring of 17 the hydrosphere is that the water cycle is still not closed [2]. The water cycle is modelled through 18 four components:, precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ET), river discharge (R) and water storage 19 differential (dS). Closing the water cycle refers to accurately quantifying each of these components at 20 a given spatial and temporal resolution so that they sum to zero on all spatio-temporal locations: 21 P−ET−R+dS= 0 (1) Among the hydrosphere component, ET remains one of the most uncertain and elusive components of 22 Earth’s water balance: it is a difficult physical process to sense as it cannot be observed directly from 23 space, and its field measurement via eddy-covariance method raise limited spatial representatives 24 [3]. Improving ET is needed for an advanced closure of the water cycle at regional to local scales. 25 Such improvement would translate into an improved capability to monitor and forecast extreme 26 hazard and to attribute to human activity a more accurate part of global change. One the one hand 27 previous studies have succeed in optimizing ET using the water cycle closure as a constrain [11,12]. 28 but such attempts was limited to global or catchment scale and raise limitation in generalizing ET 29 correction at higher scale [13]. Very recently, ML have leverage the use of hydroclimatic variables 30 and large catchment database for inferring pixelwise correction on precipitation atlas [14]. In this 31 work, we propose a method that corrects existing global ET datasets so as to better close the water 32 Submitted to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.cycle. Doing so presents two challenges: First, the water cycle constraint includes the R component, 33 which is only defined at the catchment scale, while we seek evaporation corrections at the pixel 34 scale. Second, R measurements are only sparsely available, so water cycle closure errors are only 35 available locally in space and time, while we aim to provide dense corrections to global ET datasets. 36 Our solution to both challenges is to use Machine Learning (ML) to generalize ET corrections from 37 sparse catchment levels to dense pixel level. We train a pixel-wise model to regress ET corrections 38 from globally available climatic indices, which allows us to generalize the learned corrections to 39 a dense pixel-wise resolution. Due to the nature of the R measurements, the supervision signal is 40 defined at the catchment level, so we train our model using a sum-aggregated supervision in which 41 we regress the sum of model outputs over catchment pixels to the catchment-level label. Our loss is 42 defined using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) formulation, in which we use prior knowledge on ET 43 uncertainties to guide the supervision.We evaluate the ability of learned corrections to close the water 44 cycle on unseen catchments and report consistent improvements across 4 global ET datasets. We also 45 compare ET corrections to in-situ measurements and report improvements on 3 out of 4 datasets. 46 2 Dataset 47 Figure 1: Illustration of our dataset’s catchment locations and split.Figure 1 illustrates the location of training and 48 test catchments for which we have gathered data. 49 We investigate four different global ET datasets, 50 for each of which we learn and evaluate correc- 51 tions.
