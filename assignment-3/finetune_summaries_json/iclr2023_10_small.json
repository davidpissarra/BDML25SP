Our primary focus is on tropical cyclones, the most destructive weather events, for which current models show limited performance. We investi- gate feature engineering, data augmentation, learning rate modifications, alterna- tive loss functions, and architectural changes. In contrast to previous approaches optimizing for intersection over union, we specifically seek to improve recall to penalize under-counting and prioritize identification of tropical cyclones. We re- port success through the use of weighted loss functions to counter class imbalance for these rare events. We conclude with directions for future research on extreme weather events detection, a crucial task for prediction, mitigation, and equitable adaptation to the impacts of climate change. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate action failure and extreme weather are two of the most severe global risks today (IPCC, 2022; World Economic Forum, 2022). Tropical cyclones, the most destructive extreme weather events (NOAA, 2022), have a rising and disproportionate impact on low and medium income coun- tries (LMICs), yet research into their effects focuses mostly on high-income countries (Parks & Guinto, 2022). Studies of extreme weather and climate change rely on heuristics or expert judg- ment to label data which leads to an inequitable global scientific focus, as well as discrepancies in predicted frequency, intensity, and attribution estimates. Improving automated detection of extreme weather events is thus paramount to fair attribution of climate loss and damages (Philip et al., 2020), and to develop the early warning and detection systems that will be critical for equitable adaption to climate change (IPCC, 2022; Nguyen et al., 2013). Since 2020, deep learning has shown great promise for semantic segmentation of weather patterns in climate simulation data (Prabhat et al., 2021). However, initial approaches have relied on complex architectures and hard to train models with very large numbers of parameters. A key area of research is the application of lighter-weight neural networks to semantic segmentation of tropical cyclones (TC) and atmospheric rivers (AR) (Kapp-Schwoerer et al., 2020b). Here we explore the application of the light-weight Context Guided convolutional neural network (CGNet) architecture to semantic segmentation of tropical cyclones in climate data. Input to our model is hand-labeled climate simulation data with channels that contain key atmospheric variables such as wind speed, moisture content, and atmospheric pressure for different time steps, latitudes, and longitudes. The output is a segmentation mask where each pixel takes a value corresponding to the background (BG), TC, or AR classes. 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 Specific challenges include the very small dataset size, inherent class imbalance of infrequent ex- treme events, unavoidable bias due to subjective human labeling, and limited capacity of the light- weight network. We report experiments with different hyper-parameters (loss function, learning rate), architecture (up-sampling), data augmentation, and feature engineering. We find that weighted loss functions aimed at compensating class imbalance provide the most significant improvement on recall of extreme weather events. 2 R ELATED WORK Initial inspiration for this work came from Prabhat et al. (2021) which trained a DeepLabV3+ con- volutional neural net on the ClimateNet expert-label dataset. This ∼50 million parameters model achieved an intersection over union (IoU) score (1) of 0.24 for TCs, and was the first to demonstrate that deep learning models trained on hand-labeled climate data could effectively perform seman- tic segmentation of extreme weather patterns. However, the DeepLabV3+ architecture is complex, heavy, and thus costly in terms of memory, training time, and associated carbon footprint. InSpatio-temporal segmentation and tracking of weather patterns with light-weight Neural Net- works, Kapp-Schwoerer et al. (2020b) attempt to perform the same segmentation task on the Cli- mateNet dataset with the much lighter-weight ( ∼500,000 parameters) Context Guided neural archi- tecture. They improve on Prabhat et al. (2021) with a IoU score of 0.34 and a recall of 0.57 for TCs, our primary class of interest. This model and its associated metrics form our performance baseline. For a detailed presentation of Context Guided convolutional neural networks, we refer the reader to the original paper that introduced the CGNet architecture, A light-weight Context Guided Network for semantic segmentation by Wu et al. (2021). To solve the class imbalance problem, we experi- mented with various loss functions reviewed in Survey of loss functions for semantic segmentation (Jadon, 2020).
