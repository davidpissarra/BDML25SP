With buildings accounting for about 40% of the energy consumption in Europe, it is crucial to have a com- prehensive understanding of the building stock and their energy-related characteristics, including their age, in order to make informed decisions for energy savings. This study introduces a novel way to approach the age estimation of buildings at scale, using a machine learning method that in- tegrates satellite-based imagery with morphological features of buildings. The findings demonstrate the benefits of combining these data sources and underscore the importance of incorporating local data to enable accurate prediction across different cities. 1 Introduction Buildings are significant contributors of the carbon emissions at global scale and particularly in Europe (Economidou et al., 2011). Supporting policy makers in developing legislation, propose concrete actions and monitor results to decarbonise the building stock, access to high-resolution building data is essential. Furthermore, it is estimated that 40 million Eu- ropeans were unable to heat their homes on 2022 (Eurostat, 2023), underscoring the critical importance of directing investments to where they are most needed. Therefore, transitioning from broad measures that benefit the majority to more informed decisions based on detailed data is imperative. Access to building and energy-related data necessary for effective policy design at the Euro- pean level is often limited or inconsistent. Information about buildings in the EU is typically available as aggregated statistics, such as the Building Stock Observatory (BSO) (Commis- sion, 2016-2023) and Hotmaps (Pezzutto et al., 2018), or as coarse raster maps from the Global Human Settlement Layer (GHSL) (Pesaresi, 2023). However, there is a need to identify buildings at the individual unit level. Recent efforts in this direction include the publicly available EUBUCCO (Milojevic-Dupont et al., 2023), DBSM (Florio et al., 2023), and Overture (Foundation, 2023) databases. The construction period of a building is a crucial indicator for gaining a better understanding of its energy-related characteristics and estimate its energy performance. Three primary open and public data sources currently provide information on the construc- tion age of individual buildings. The first source is OpenStreetMap (OSM), which offers sparse and unevenly distributed coverage of the EU with crowdsourced information (Con- tributors, 2022), as can be seen in Figure 1a. The second source is the combination of cadastral sources by GISCO from EUSTAT, which is currently restricted to large parts of Spain, France, and The Netherlands (Gisco, 2023), as shown in Figure 1b. Lastly, EU- BUCCO covers 200 million buildings in EU countries, with 24% including the building 1Published as a workshop poster at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 age. This data encompasses ∼50M individual buildings, primarily distributed across five countries: France ( ∼21.5M buildings), Spain ( ∼16M buildings), the Netherlands ( ∼10M buildings), Italy ( ∼1.5M buildings), and Finland ( ∼50K buildings). The data was obtained from national cadastral and municipal datasets.   (a) Number of buildings in Europe with informa- tion on age of construction from OSM   (b) Year of Construction of buildings from GISCO (EUSTAT) In the literature, various methodologies have been proposed for deriving the age of buildings. Li et al. (2018) and Zeppelzauer et al. (2018) utilized Deep Learning models to estimate building age from non-openly available images sourced from Google Street View images, real estate evaluation reports, and web platforms. Garbasevschi et al. (2021) adopted a different approach, training a Random Forest classification model based on visual features of buildings, including geometric attributes and location-contextual information for selected cities in Germany. The most recent methodology, introduced by Nachtigall et al. (2023), demonstrated the feasibility of large-scale building age prediction using morphology features. The objective of our study is to derive an initial estimate of building construction age at the EU scale using openly available datasets. To achieve this, we aim to utilize non- commercial data and methodologies capable of scaling up, particularly those reliant on Earth Observation data. In this paper, we employ a traditional machine learning algorithm to integrate multi-temporal built-up surface grid rom the GHSL Global Human Settlement Layer and morphological features extracted from OSM. Our study demonstrates that this combined approach yields superior results compared to using either data source in isolation. 2 Methodology A novel solution has been developed, integrating data on the age of building construction obtained from satellite imagery from\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
