First, we present a comprehensive and high fidelity remotely sensed active fire dataset fused from over 20 satellites. Second, we develop region-specific ML-based 3-7 day wildfire hazard prediction models for South America, Australia, and Southern Europe. The different models cover pixel-wise, spatial and spatio-temporal architectures, and utilize weather, fuel and location data. We evaluate the models using time-based cross-validation and can show superior performance with a PR-AUC score up to 44 times higher compared to the baseline FWI model. Using explainable AI methods, we show that these data-driven models are also capable of learning meaningful physical patterns and inferring region-specific wildfire drivers. Climate Impact Boreal forests are the largest terrestrial carbon sink, storing more than one-third of all terrestrial carbon [ 45]. Wildfires are a serious threat to them; for example, between March and July 2023, hundreds of fires burned out of control in Canada, consuming more than 3% of the country’s total forest area [ 6,7,26]. These wildfires can turn forests from a carbon sink to a carbon source if vegetation regrowth cannot compensate, further accelerating climate change [ 2,14,20,40,45]. At the same time, climate change itself is altering fire regimes worldwide. Regions with ecologically beneficial wildfires are experiencing extreme drought, often leaving insufficient flammable vegetation to support regular fire regimes; Other regions are experiencing more frequent and catastrophic wildfires [ 4,14,22]. The timely and accurate prediction of wildfire hazard is a critical element in limiting the negative impacts of wildfires by supporting the efficient deployment of firefighting resources. It can also help improve early warning systems that protect communities, ecosystems, and critical infrastructure. Machine learning models have proven to be a valuable tool for this prediction [1, 15, 31, 33]. In this paper, we present a high-quality dataset of active fires that has been compiled and harmonized from more than 20 different satellites. We demonstrate its potential for wildfire hazard modeling by building models for up to 1 week in advance wildfire prediction based on weather and fuel data. The models outperform widely used hazard indices such as the Fire Weather Index (FWI) over the entire precision-recall curve. We utilize explainable AI methods to verify that the models use physically plausible patterns. We also discuss how the models can be used to support practical decision making and highlight remaining challenges. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.1 Dataset In this paper, we selected three study regions with very different fuel and weather characteristics [9, 18,27]:Australia,Brazil, and Greece. We use data from October 2019 - October 2022 aggregated to daily values at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degree ( ≈11 km). Fire Hazard We approximate the hazard by predicting the occurrence of wildfires. We curated the fire event ground truth data product in our company by assimilating over 20 satellite products from both LEO and GEO satellites1, employing a spectrum of instruments encompassing infrared and multi-spectral visual sensors to create our active fire satellite data product. A detailed description can be found in Table 1. We chose active fire data over burned area data, due to its real-time nature, ensuring immediate and accurate representation of ongoing fire dynamics. Burned area data often lags by several days, introducing inaccuracies, especially for smaller fires that might be underestimated or missed entirely [ 5]. The data sources are retrieved from the respective operator/data provider through different terrestrial and satellite-based links. Subsequently, they are standardized in terms of format and type to ensure compatibility for future processing steps. Hotspots representing thermal anomalies are generated in the first processing stage, either by derivation or direct ingestion as third-party data products. The hotspots, along with auxiliary data like Fire Radiative Power (FRP) and brightness temperature, are processed and aggregated along with third-party fire products into active fires clusters. We then employ advanced clustering methods to filter out persistent heat sources (e.g., factories, volcanoes), reflections (e.g., water, solar panels, steel roofs), and false positives through correlation with environmental datasets to enhance the precision of our final active fire satellite data product. Each cluster is assigned a confidence value based on the count of satellites and fire detection algorithms linked to the hotspots within a given cluster. For this study, clusters with a confidence level exceeding 0.5 were included to account for a reasonable degree of certainty. Hazard Factors Two critical wildfire hazard factors are weather, used by virtually all approaches including physical [ 25], statistical [ 17], and AI-based [ 11,21], and available fuel. In our approach, we combine both: We incorporate weather data from the ERA5-Land dataset, aggregating hourly measurements to daily at a spatial resolution of 0.1 degrees [ 12,16,36].
