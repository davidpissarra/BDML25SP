We combine radar and optical hyperspectral imagery, with a physical climate parameter of SIF-based GPP. Validation results show that a masked variation of UNet has the lowest validation RMSE of 37.93 ±1.36 Mg C/ha, as compared to 52.30 ±0.03 Mg C/ha for random forest algorithm. Furthermore, models that learn from SIF-based GPP in addition to radar and optical imagery reduce validation RMSE by almost 10% and the standard deviation by 40%. Finally, we apply our model to measure losses in AGB from the recent 2021 Caldor wildfire in California, and validate our analysis with Sentinel-based burn index. 1 Introduction Aboveground carbon biomass (AGB) is an important component to monitor carbon cycle on the local [ 1,2] and global scale [ 3,4]. A recent state-of-the-art light detection and ranging (LiDAR) mission from NASA’s Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) generates a global yet non-continuous sparse measurements of vegetation parameters, including AGB estimates with a 60-meter along-track and 600-meter across-track gaps between footprints [ 5]. Here, we apply a Physics-informed deep network to generate a 30-meter resolution, wall-to-wall continuous AGB estimate in CONUS for the summertime (June-August) 2021 period. The model is trained on more than one million GEDI footprints using a combination of radar and optical imagery [6]. In addition, we incorporate a measure of photosynthetic intensity as captured by solar-induced fluorescence (SIF)-based gross primary production (GPP). SIF-based GPP is one of the key physical parameters regulating AGB [ 7,8]. We validate our results using field-based AGB observations and evaluate their consistency across climate zones. Finally, we use our high resolution AGB map to assess the impact of wildfire, in terms of how much carbon biomass had been lost to the environment. ∗Corresponding author (jn2808@columbia.edu) Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.2 Methodology This section provides a detailed description of the data, models, and evaluation metrics used, and are summarized in Figure 1.

The modeling process is iterated across different data setups (SIF/S1/S2, S1/S2, and S2-only) in an ablation study. 2.1 Data Processing GEDI is one of the current state-of-the-art spaceborne LiDAR missions to capture a detailed measure of ecosystem structure [ 9]. However, the data generated is spatially sparse. Therefore, we attempt to produce a dense 30-meter resolution AGB estimate using multiple input features including radar and optical hyperspectral imagery from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, as well as SIF-based GPP from the OCO-2 mission [ 7]. We use the vertical co-polarization (VV) and vertical/horizontal cross- polarization (VH) band of Sentinel-1, and the entire 12 bands of Sentinel-2. Furthermore, we produce near-cloud-free optical imagery by taking the median value of non-cloudy pixel as defined by the scene classification layer (SCL) of Sentinel-2. Finally, we perform grid cell geospatial matching to combine the dataset together. The validation sites are situated in the Northwestern America [ 10] and New England [11]. 2.2 Model and Experimental Setup We benchmark our deep network model against linear regressor (LR), random forests (RF) [ 12], and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) [ 13] algorithms due to their reported robustness in climate- related tasks [ 14]. Specifically, we implement a masked variation of UNet [ 15] due to the sparsity of our target AGB variable [ 16]. The models are optimized using a randomized grid search and a k-fold cross validation (k=5) approaches. We split the data into a 90-10 training-testing set, where set here refers to pixels for ML-based models and tiles for deep networks. We use Adam optimizer [ 17] with a learning rate of 0.01 and root-mean-squared error (RMSE) as our loss function. For the deep network, we use a size 32 batching and implement a collection of image augmentations including\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
