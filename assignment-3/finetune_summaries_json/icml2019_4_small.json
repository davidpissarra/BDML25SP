Fo- cus learning model learns location and appearance of target at ﬁrst frame of video with auto-encoding fashion, and then, learned feature is fed into track- ing model to follows the target in consecutive time frames. Extensive experiments show that the proposed tracking framework signiﬁcantly outper- forms against state-of-the-art tracking algorithms. 1. Introduction Tracking climate events are pressing and challenging prob- lems that humanity has faced for a long time. Traditionally, most conventional approaches have been built upon human expertise based on scientiﬁc intuition and related physics variables (Lorenc, 1986). Recently, computer vision com- munity has made signiﬁcant progress by applying various pattern recognition techniques in visual object tracking, a task to locate a target object in a video, maintaining its iden- tity and yielding its individual trajectory, given its initial location in the ﬁrst frame. Extreme climate event tracking is similar to visual object tracking, but it has unique and challenging aspects: 1.Climate events may be dependent on longer-term and wider-range spatio-temporal dynamics (known as ‘but- terﬂy effect’) between multiple scientiﬁc variables than *Equal contribution1Lawrence Livermore National Labo- ratories, Livermore, CA, USA2Korea University, Seoul, Ko- rea3google, Mountain view, CA, USA4Lawrence Berke- ley National Laboratories, Livermore, CA, USA.

This fact makes it difﬁcult to associate an object of interest with the correct one in consecutive frames. Because of these unique properties, a conventional tracking- by-detection method, which detects the object mainly by its appearance but relatively neglects spatio-temporal dy- namics, is less suitable to this problem. An ideal climate event tracker needs to effectively take long-term and wide- range dynamics into account, capturing subtle differences among events from sparsely collected training data. In this work, we propose a simple but robust end-to-end model, suitable for the climate event tracking problem utilizing ConvLSTM. Speciﬁcally, the proposed model consists of two sub-modules, (1) the focus learning module to learn where and what to focus, and (2) the tracking module to track what we focused on. The focus learning module is designed to extract the latent feature of the target event from the ﬁrst frame, given spatio-temporal data and the initial location of the target. Given the representation of the tar- get event, the tracking module localizes the learned feature of a target object in the subsequent frames, predicting its location. 2. Related Work Conventional extreme climate event detection and track- ing methods rely on numerical simulation-based methods, including an ensemble of multiple prediction models or multi-scale prediction systems (Weber, 2003; Elsberry et al., 2008; Sippel & Zhang, 2008; Poroseva et al., 2010; Ma- jumdar & Finocchio, 2010; Snyder et al., 2010; Tien et al., 2012; Qi et al., 2014; Thanh et al., 2016; Dong & Zhang, 2016).
