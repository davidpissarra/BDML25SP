To better decipher these DNA signals, we propose a multi-task learning approach that uses deep learning and feature attribution methods to identify DNA sequence signals that control gene expression in the methanotroph M. buryatense.

If successful, this work would enhance our ability to build gene expression tools to more effectively engineer M. buryatense into an efﬁ- cient biomolecule factory that can divert methane pollution into valuable, everyday materials. 1. Introduction Globally, human societies are consuming ﬁnite resources at unsustainable rates. Transitioning away from our depen- dencies on non-renewable resources and towards a cycli- cal, sustainable use of natural products is critical for re- ducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving Earth’s most threatened ecosystems, and securing longer term economic stability.

Metabolic engineering: a process to engineer microor- ganisms into biological factories that convert renewable inputs into more-sustainably sourced products. renewable feedstocks (e.g., sugar cane) or waste streams (e.g., methane emissions, industrial waste-gas) into essen- tial products like biofuels, medicines, and a wide range of biologically-derived materials ( 31,28,12). In order for mi- crobial metabolic engineering to succeed as an alternative platform for producing valuable molecules that are other- wise sourced unsustainably, the process must be economi- cally viable. From a biological engineering standpoint, this means that the microbial factories must be genetically op- timized to produce the target molecules efﬁciently and at high yields (44). Increasingly, automation and predictive modeling have been essential for accelerating the ability of metabolic en- gineering platforms to compete with industries rooted in petroleum, fossil fuels, or other unsustainable practices (27,24). Many facets of metabolic engineering pipelines have improved with machine learning, such as metabolic network prediction ( 14,30), bioreactor and fermentation process optimization ( 34,6), and protein engineering ( 3,19). Organism engineering – in particular reliably predicting bi- ological outcomes from newly installed DNA parts – is another area of metabolic engineering that could beneﬁt from machine learning. Organisms execute genetic pro- grams using complex systems of signals that are encoded as DNA sequence patterns. The combination and orientation of these DNA patterns intricately regulate gene expression, or the timing and strength at which each gene turns on or off. While various approaches are being pursued ( 13,46,10), the precise rules of these “genetic grammars” are still poorly understood and the task of predicting gene expression output in engineered microorganisms remains difﬁcult. Deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural net-A multi-task learning approach to enhance sustainable biomolecule production in engineered microorganisms works (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are well-suited to DNA sequence pattern discovery tasks: they are particularly adept at learning important features without prior knowledge, ﬁnding relevant patterns within larger con- texts, and considering non-linear or longer-term dependen- cies between learned features ( 22,16). We propose using a multi-task deep learning approach to elucidate genetic grammar rules in microorganisms with potential to serve as metabolic engineering platforms. Speciﬁcally, by 1) using deep learning model architectures to predict gene expression strength across a variety of growth conditions directly from DNA sequences and 2) applying feature attribution methods to identify meaningful patterns within the DNA inputs, we can use these discovered patterns to develop genetic tools re- quired to optimize microbes to produce valuable molecules efﬁciently, sustainably, and at large scales. 2. Background 2.1. Sustainable Biomolecule Production Humans rely on many biologically-derived molecules: fuels for transportation, ﬁbers in clothing, medicinal molecules from plants. Molecules naturally found in organisms are typically produced via some metabolic pathway, or a se- ries of chemical conversions carried out by enzymes that can transform inputs, like sugars, into other molecules organisms need to survive. Organisms store instructions for building metabolic pathway enzymes in DNA. Since DNA is a common language between all organisms, genetic instructions are potentially transferable between species.

Introduction\n\nHuman societies are consuming finite resources at unsustainable rates. Transitioning away from non-renewable resources and towards a cyclical, sustainable use of natural products is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving ecosystems, and securing economic stability. Metabolic engineering aims to address sustainability concerns by engineering microorganisms into biological factories that convert renewable inputs into sustainable products.\n\nMetabolic engineering involves converting renewable feedstocks or waste streams into essential products like biofuels, medicines, and biologically-derived materials. For this process to be economically viable, microbial factories must be genetically optimized to produce target molecules efficiently and at high yields. Automation and predictive modeling have accelerated the ability of metabolic engineering platforms to compete with industries rooted in petroleum and fossil fuels.\n\nMachine learning has improved various aspects of metabolic engineering, including metabolic network prediction, bioreactor and fermentation process optimization, and protein engineering. However, predicting biological outcomes from newly installed DNA parts remains a challenge. Organisms execute genetic programs using complex systems of signals encoded as DNA sequence patterns. The combination and orientation of these patterns regulate gene expression, but the precise rules of these \"genetic grammars\" are poorly understood.\n\nDeep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are well-suited to DNA sequence pattern discovery tasks. We propose using a multi-task deep learning approach to elucidate genetic grammar rules in microorganisms that can serve as metabolic engineering platforms. By predicting gene expression strength directly from DNA sequences and applying feature attribution methods, we can identify meaningful patterns within the DNA inputs and develop genetic tools to optimize microbes for efficient, sustainable, and large-scale production of valuable molecules.\n\n2.
