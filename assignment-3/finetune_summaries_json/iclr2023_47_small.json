This can be attributed to their ability to effectively model long-range dependencies in spatio-temporal data through computationally ef- ficient global convolutions. However, the use of discrete Fourier transforms (DFTs) in FNOs leads to spurious artifacts and pronounced dissipation when applied to spherical coordinates, due to the incorrect assumption of flat geometry.

Modeling Earth’s complex weather and climate accurately, in a computationally efficient manner, has wide-ranging implications for science and society across the enterprise of climate prediction, mitigation, and adaptation. Weather and climate modeling has traditionally relied on principled physics- and process-based numerical simulations that solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) governing the fluid dynamics, ther- modynamics, and other physics of the Earth system. These equations are discretised and solved on a grid, but the wide range of spatial and temporal scales, as well as complex nonlinear interactions across these scales, necessitate fine grids and high resolution making these computations extremely expensive. Machine learning (ML) provides alternative approaches to modeling weather and climate, and more generally spatio-temporal dynamics, by describing the time evolution of the system as a learned transition map between states of the time-discretized physical system exclusively from raw data. While this enables a unified treatment of the full system, the physics is deduced from data alone without imposing the strong inductive bias of aforementioned physics-based models. Hence, purely data-driven ML-based methods have struggled to faithfully represent the dynamics of physical systems, especially those with long-range correlations in space and time. Fourier Neural Operators Li et al. (2020) and their variants Guibas et al. (2021); Wen et al. (2022) possess the advantage of learning mappings between function spaces, which act globally on the entire domain. This is in contrast to other architectures, which employ local operations such as convolutions and use hierarchies to model non-local interactions Falk et al. (2019); McCormick (1987).
