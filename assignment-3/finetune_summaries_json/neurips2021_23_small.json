In this work, we propose machine learning approaches for these longer lead-times as an important new application area in the energy domain. We demonstrate the poten- tial of several deep sequence learning techniques for both point predictions and probabilistic predictions at these longer lead-times. We compare their performance for subseasonal forecasting (forecast lead-times of roughly two weeks) using the SURFRAD data set for 7 stations across the U.S. in 2018. The results are en- couraging; the deep sequence learning methods outperform the current benchmark for machine learning-based probabilistic predictions (previously applied at short lead-times in this domain), along with relevant baselines. 1 Introduction Renewable energy resources such as wind and solar are abundantly available in nature and have the potential to reduce society’s dependence on fossil fuels. However, these resources are variable and uncertain, posing challenges for integration into a power system which is predicated upon dispatchable supply. There is therefore a growing need for accurate renewable energy forecasting to enable reliable integration into electric grids. Solar photovoltaics (PV) systems are experiencing exponential growth in deployment and the output of PV systems is highly dependent on solar irradiance [ 1]. A number of physical and statistical models have been used for making solar forecasts at different timescales from intra-hour to a few days-ahead [ 18,21]. Statistical methods have been shown to perform well at forecasting at very short time horizons, with numerical weather prediction models (NWP) outperforming them in the hours to days-ahead timeframe [18]. The works in [ 1,13,9,6] show the potential of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) for solar energy forecasting.

Temporal CNNs have recently been applied to forecasting day-ahead PV power output, outperforming both LSTMs and multi-layer feed forward networks [ 12]. In this work, we study a signiﬁcantly longer forecast horizon, and compare Temporal CNNs, Temporal CNNs with an added attention layer [16], and the Transformer model [19], against LSTMs. Probabilistic forecasting provides a distribution over the prediction, this additional knowledge of uncertainty estimates is an advantage over point forecasting. Knowing about future time peri- ods of low and high uncertainty in advance can be very useful in planning [ 23]. Until recently, probabilistic forecasting for solar energy had not received as much attention as for other renew- able energy sources, as observed in [ 7], which introduces probabilistic benchmarks to evaluate probabilistic methods, which we will utilize in this work. Recently, [ 23] show how probabilis- tic models such as Gaussian processes, neural networks with dropout for uncertainty estima- tion, and NGBoost [ 8] compare when making short-term solar forecasts. They explored post hoccalibration techniques for improving the forecasts produced by these models. We now con- sider NGBoost, i.e., Natural Gradient Boosting algorithm [ 8] with a Gaussian output distribution, to be a machine learning benchmark in this domain, since it showed superior performance for intra-hour and hourly resolution forecasting [ 23]. Deep learning-based probabilistic prediction models are, however, yet to be fully explored [ 21]. In this paper, we extend the deep learning point prediction models mentioned above to yield predictions at multiple quantiles (see Figure 1) as quantile regression is a non-parametric approach to obtain probabilistic forecasts [ 21,16]. Figure 1: Fan plot showing the best performing (Trans- former) model’s prediction intervals from 5% to 95% percentile on three March days at the Boulder station.Most physical models in this domain are based on NWP simulations that traditionally provide more accurate forecasts at hours to days-ahead lead times [ 18]. However, due to their computa- tional expense, NWP model outputs are updated less frequently and with coarser resolution at longer prediction lead times, such as week(s) ahead. This motivates the need for data-driven machine learning models that can provide fore- casts at longer periods in advance at a ﬁner (1 hour) resolution (as opposed to e.g., 12 hour resolution in the case of European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) model predictions). We train and test only on daylight hours (for relevance to the domain, as in [ 7]), and our forecasts are made at 168 daytime hours ahead.
