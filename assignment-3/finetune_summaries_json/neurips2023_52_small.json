The recent advancements in satellite imagery and deep learning allow the development of affordable and powerful CD solutions. The breakthroughs in computer vision Foundation Models (FMs) bring new opportunities for better and more flexible remote sensing solutions.

With the high rate of city development and deterioration of the natural environment, the importance of CD is higher than ever before [ 15]. CD plays an important role in environmental and surface change monitoring [8], urban planning [7], disaster evaluation [17], agriculture [7], among many other applications. In bi-temporal change detection, given two input images, the pre-event image It1∈RN2×Cand the post-event image It2∈RN2×C, of the same place taken at two different times t1andt2where N andCare the spatial and spectral dimensions of the images. The binary CD refers to detecting the accumulated change, δ˜t∈ {0,1}N2, during the period ˜t=t2−t1. Some examples of CD image pairs, from the LEVIR-CD dataset [5], are shown in Figure 1. The complexity of satellite imagery data makes CD a challenging task. However, the recent advances in foundation models (FMs) [ 10,16,6] bring new opportunities. Recently prompt learning in computer vision [ 14] is gaining the attention of the researchers as an alternative to transfer learning and fine-tuning. It becomes possible due to the emergence of efficient self-supervised [ 10], and model-in-the-loop training procedures [16].

The pairs are from LEVIR-CD dataset. The idea of prompt learning is to freeze the parameters of the foundation model and prompt it with new learnable features. Another powerful approach is adaptation [ 6], where a new module (adapter) is attached to the frozen foundation model and training is performed on the adapter parameters only. Among the recently developed FMs is the Segment Anything Model (SAM) [ 16], which has demon- strated a great ability in zero-shot image segmentation of different modalities. Benefiting from the powerful capabilities of SAM, in order to solve the CD problem, has not been explored before and this article presents the first SAM-based CD model. 2 Related Work The main scheme of solving CD follows the typical techniques used in dense prediction ( e.g.semantic segmentation) where an encoder, with a convolutional neural network (CNN) [ 19],e.g. a ResNet [11] or Transformer [ 2] backbone, is used to extract features from the pre and post-event images. The features, from both images, are then fused to form a change latent space. This space is then ingested by a decoder module to predict the change masks. Regarding training, transfer learning is the most common training procedure for CD models, where the backbone layers are trained (or fine-tuned) alongside the change fusion and decoder layers. Siamese neural networks are currently the most successful architectures [ 3,18], and diverse feature fusion methods have been developed. Multi-scale fusion methods are developed in [ 5,18] to enrich the change latent space. In [ 4] relation and scale-aware modules are developed to capture interactive information of the change in both images. Auxiliary losses can guide feature fusion and improve the quality of the detected masks [ 19]. The wide field of view, offered by Transformer backbones, is shown to improve the context of the change features [ 2], making it easier to capture long-range dependencies of the change features within the same image (using self-attention) and between the pre and post-event images (with cross-attention). 3 SAM-CD SAM was created to segment an input image using a prompt [ 16]. It can take multiple sparse (points and bounding boxes) and/or dense prompts (binary masks). It was trained with model-in-loop with 1 billion masks.
