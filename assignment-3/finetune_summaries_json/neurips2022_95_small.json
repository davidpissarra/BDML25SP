Data on the number of such individuals residing in a given area is limited. This study proposes a load disaggregation model to predict the number of medical devices behind an electric distribution feeder. This data can be used to inform planning and response. The proposed solution serves as a measure for climate change adaptation. 1 Problem and motivation Over 4.4 million people in the U.S. rely on electricity-dependent in-home medical devices and services [ 1]. Extreme weather events that cause power outages can lead to increased mortality rates [2,3] in such individuals or to additional stress for hospitals, shelters, and emergency services [ 4â€“6]. Unfortunately, there have been several disaster emergencies that corroborate this (see Appendix A for examples). Energy resilience for home healthcare is a largely unexplored problem and needs proactive approaches to meet the needs of this vulnerable community [7]. Climate change is driving more intense and frequent extreme weather events, which put pressure on an aging power grid infrastructure. Power outages tied to extreme weather have doubled across the U.S. in the last two decades, and the frequency and length of outages are at their highest [ 8]. Also, the lack of comprehensive data on medically fragile individuals hinders effective planning and response. We propose performing load disaggregation on electric distribution feeder data to identify the number of in-home medical devices downstream of a feeder. Our solution does not depend on precise location or number of individuals, therefore respecting personal privacy. We also propose creating a dataset of power data measurements for in-home medical devices. Our method can be used to estimate the number of medically fragile individuals in an area and improve preparedness for power outages. * These authors contributed equally. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 20222 Related approaches and datasets Traditional methods to find the number and locations of such individuals rely on private patient data, either on lists by healthcare providers or electric utility medical baseline programs (e.g., from PG&E [9]), where customers can self-register if they use in-home medical devices. However, this is relevant only for countries with centralized healthcare and it can lead to incomplete and inaccurate data, as shown by a 2018 survey on New York City residents [10]. The HHS emPOWER map [ 1] has improved on utility baseline programs by using Medicare insurance data to estimate the number of people who rely on in-home medical devices at zip code level. The map covers Medicare beneficiaries but it is estimated that millions more rely on electricity-dependent medical technology in the U.S., including over 180,000 children [ 11]. The proposed study aims to build upon and expand the emPOWER map. We found only one method in the literature that uses energy consumption data to address a facet of this problem. Bean et al. [12] assume prior knowledge of the houses with in-home medical devices, and use smart meter voltage data to identify their supply phase. Our approach is based on energy disaggregation at the feeder level. Load disaggregation has been reviewed in [ 13,14] and most related work addresses disaggregation at the household level. Ledva et al. [15] perform feeder-level disaggregation, using real-time feeder values to separate the demand of air conditioners and of other loads. Such non-intrusive load monitoring (NILM) techniques have also recently grown in popularity across different use cases, such as estimating solar PV generation for a given feeder [ 16]. However, these methods rely on real-time feedback for forecasting, which does not apply to our problem. Further discussion on related approaches can be found in Appendix B 3 Proposed methodology The input for the proposed model is power data from an electric distribution system feeder. As shown in Figure 1, a distribution substation has many feeders, and each feeder has multiple customers downstream. The predictor of the model is power data measured at the feeder, and the predictand is the number of medical devices present downstream of that feeder. Figure 1: Distribution systemWe propose partnering with 10-20 households using in-home medical devices and gaining consent to mon- itor their device usage. This range is large enough for a proof of concept, while being small enough to be feasible to locate within a feeder and onboard for our data collection. However, this may change at the time of implementation. Monitoring would be through smart meters at the medical device level, with a sam- pling rate of the order of 1Hz. These measurements would be used mainly to record whether each device was on or off for each timestamp, given some thresh- old. We will get a time series of the number of such devices running at a time to be used as ground truth data for training, and this would not be required at the time of model inference. The set of in-home medical devices is vast [ 17], and we propose starting with a single device as a proof of concept. We propose choosing the in-home ventilator [ 18] as the device\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
