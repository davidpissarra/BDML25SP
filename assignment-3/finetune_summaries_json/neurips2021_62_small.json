In this proposal, with our preliminary work, it is shown that Machine Learning tools like Optical Character Recognition and Natural Language Processing can aid in screening and selection of injection sites for CO 2storage, facilitate identiﬁcation of possible CO 2leakage paths in the subsurface, and assist in locating a depleted gas/oil well suitable for CO 2 injection and long term storage. The automated process based on ML tools can also drastically decrease the decision making cycle time in the site selection and assessment phase by reducing human effort. In the longer term, we expect ML tools like Deep Neural Network can also be utilized in CO 2storage monitoring, injection optimization etc. By injecting CO 2into a trapping geological underground formation in a safe and sustainable manner, the oil and gas industry can contribute substantially in reducing global warming and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement by the end of this century. 1 Introduction According to Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report [ 1], 14 percent of the global greenhouse gas emissions reductions needed by 2050 can be achieved through carbon capture. Speciﬁcally in the industrial sector (fuel burning power plants, Oil & Gas reﬁnery, etc.), carbon capture is the only viable way to achieve full decarbonization. Various carbon capture technology (physical, membrane and Cryogenic, etc.) are under active development [ 2]. Once captured, the carbon dioxide can be put to productive use in enhanced oil recovery, manufacturing fuels, and building materials in limited quantities. Most of captured CO 2will have to be stored in underground geological formations such as a structural trap. As shown in Fig. 1, the geological structure trapping mechanism is exactly the same as for gas and oil reservoirs. Therefore, the oil & gas industry is well positioned to handle this CO 2sequestration challenge, based on years of experience in hydrocarbon exploration/extraction/injection from various underground geological formations (oil/gas trapping). With the possibility of implementation of carbon tax regulations in the near term, the economic incentives for the oil and gas industry to work on carbon sequestration projects will increase. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021Figure 1: illustration showing structural traps for storing CO 2in underground geological formations. Gas and oil reservoirs share exact same trapping mechanisms. Image is retrieved from DOE Carbon Storage Program [3]. Carbon sequestration is generally separated into four pillars: Capacity, Transport & Injection, Containment, and ﬁnally Monitoring & Corrective Measures. Capacity is the very ﬁrst step which evaluates the storage capacity at a certain sequestration site, depending primarily on the geological formation at the sequestration site. Five types of underground formations for geologic carbon storage are currently under active investigation: saline formations, oil and natural gas reservoirs, un-mineable coal seams, organic-rich shales, and basalt formations [ 3]. Among these options, depleted oil/gas reservoir is the most economically viable sites to store CO 2, provided the depleted reservoirs have suitable properties: a geological trap with good seal to avoid leakage in long term. Therefore, choosing a proper site for carbon storage is crucial in realizing both the near and long term goal of carbon sequestration. To do this, geologists have to manually read through hundreds (sometimes thousands) of drilling & completion reports, and abandonment status reports (some can be dated back to late 1930s and written by hand) and extract relevant information in the Region of Interest (ROI), then summarize and synthesize all the ﬁndings and evaluate the over-all quality of storage potential for each CO 2injection site. Then an estimation of potential storage capacity can be made for this ROI, followed by a feasibility study and decision to either further develop the ROI or abandon it if it is not practical. Machine Learning (ML) technologies like Boosted Decision Tree [ 4], and Deep Neural Network (DNN) [ 5] have been used in various O&G applications, such as rock type determination [ 6,7], geophysical work ﬂows like well tie [ 8] or salt picking [ 9], reservoir property analysis [ 10], and ﬁeld offset well pressure data analysis [ 11]. In this study, we propose to apply Optical Character Recognition (OCR) [ 12] and Natural Language Processing (NLP) [ 13] ML tools to the carbon sequestration problem, speciﬁcally, in the sequestration site assessment process. The goal for OCR is to automate the reading process for hundreds of well reports, and automatically extract textual information from those well logs. Following this, NLP will be used to tokenize and extract relevant informations like abundant status, casing, cementing\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
