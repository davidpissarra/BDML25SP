This proposal explores the problem of fresh-water access in northern Kenya and measures being taken to safeguard water access despite these harsh climatic changes. We present an integrated water man- agement and decision-support platform, eMaji Manager, that we developed and deployed in ﬁve ASAL counties in northern Kenya to manage waterpoint access for people and livestock. We then propose innovative machine learning methods for understanding waterpoint usage and repair patterns for sensor-instrumented waterpoints (e.g., boreholes). We explore sub-sequence discriminatory models and recurrent neural networks to predict waterpoint failures, improve repair re- sponse times, and ultimately support continuous access to water. 1 I NTRODUCTION Achieving sustainable access to fresh water for low- and middle-income countries with an ever- expanding population requires multifaceted approaches, particularly in arid and semi-arid lands (ASALs). Resilience to climate variability and change in ASALs is greatly dependent on sustainable access to groundwater Taylor et al. (2013). Changes in climatic patterns are likely to increase the spatio-temporal variability in precipitation rates and surface water that makes it difﬁcult to rely on these sources of water. Mitigating solutions such as rainwater harvesting, while important, may not be sustainable in ASALs which are often characterized by prolonged spells of drought followed by rainstorm ﬂash ﬂoods that cause heavy loss of life and property Lin (1999). Kenya has experienced a rise in the frequency of drought and ﬂoods in recent years. An analysis done in the country by Glew et al. (2010) indicates that climate change will likely increase drought incidences, temperatures, and water scarcity in northern Kenya which can exacerbate the poverty levels in a region that depends on rangeland grazing of livestock for their livelihood. Consequently, this region needs to adapt and manage its limited groundwater resources differently. However, to date, policy- and decision-makers lack the necessary tools for improved evidence-based decision support necessary for the planning and management of groundwater resources. Fortunately, recent advancements in technologies such as remote sensors and IoT (Internet of Things) devices combined with new deep learning methods can be leveraged to understand challenges and generate insights pertaining to access and use of groundwater. We present a novel water supply management and decision-support platform using a case study of ﬁve counties in northern Kenya. We then propose two key areas for machine learning to provide new insights into waterpoint management and decision-support: (1) the use of discriminatory sub- sequence mining of waterpoint data to detect recurrent behaviours or unknown trends on deployed waterpoint sensors, and (2) waterpoint failure prediction using long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Figure 1: Sensors dashboard in eMaji Manager indicating sensor and site information. 2 EMAJIMANAGER PLATFORM :INVENTORY,ISSUE REPORTING AND REMOTE SENSING FOR WATERPOINTS The eMaji Manager is an integrated mobile and web waterpoints management system that has been implemented across 5 counties in northern Kenya through the KRAPID (Kenya Resilient Arid Lands Project for Integrated Development Project) initiative mwa. One of the goals of KRAPID is to improve water access in the 5 northern counties of Kenya from 37% to more than 50%. Before the start of the project, county water ofﬁcials relied on a community leader to inform them about an issue at a waterpoint such as a pump failure at a borehole. A team from the county would then conduct a site visit to conﬁrm the issue and plan for repair. The repair work would then commence, and once completed and the waterpoint is functional, the issue was closed. This process would take weeks to months for a single waterpoint and could involve multiple waterpoints spread out in different geographical locations. As a result, many communities were often left without continuous access to water. To mitigate such technical water inaccessibility challenges, KRAPID aims at using technology to signiﬁcantly reduce the time of reporting and repair of waterpoints. The eMaji Manager ensures efﬁciency and transparency in the management and operation of water- points. The platform has the following key capabilities: ticketing and issue tracking for monitoring and repair of boreholes; descriptive analytics for reporting at the county and sub-county levels; and visualization and analytics for decision support. For each waterpoint, the platform captures informa- tion about the waterpoint name, geolocation, functional status, cost of water for livestock and people, and infrastructural details. Additionally, we collect time-series data from sensor-instrumented bore- holes such as operating hours, yield, and operational status. The data from the sensors is visualized on a dashboard that is used by county government ofﬁcials for monitoring. Thus far, \".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
