In order to better understand the relation- ship between climatic factors and almond yield, an automated machine learning framework is used to build a collection of machine learning models. The prediction skill is assessed using historical records. Future projections are derived using 17 downscaled climate outputs. The ensemble mean projection displays almond yield changes under two different climate scenarios, along with two technology development scenarios, where the role of technology development is highlighted. The mean projections and distributions provide insightful results to stakeholders and can be utilized by policymakers for climate adaptation. 1 Introduction California is the most significant almond-producing region in the world. Eighty percent of the almonds consumed globally and all commercially sold in the United States are produced in California. Almonds were California’s most profitable agricultural export product and the second-largest com- modity overall in 2020 [ 1]. Previous studies have shown that climate factors can influence almond growth [ 2,3], and when these climate factors change due to global warming, the yield of almonds will inevitably suffer. Thus, a precise projection is necessary for both scientific research and climate adaptations. Because of the difficulty in simulating the growth process of perennial crops, very few process-based crop models can be utilized to investigate the relationship between climatic variables and almond Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.yields. Data-driven approaches, including machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, have gained popularity in Earth system modeling since the emergence of artificial intelligence due to their capacity to fit nonlinear functions. Many studies have applied ML and DL models for various tasks, such as hydrology projection, air quality analysis and severe weather forecasting [ 4,5,6]. The ML and DL models can be designed in an end-to-end manner to examine the relationship between input and output variables. While this strategy is often effective, a proper model architecture is required, which often involves specialized knowledge. Automated machine learning (AutoML) frameworks are designed to save these efforts and to facilitate the use of ML models by researchers without a background in computer science, as is frequently the case for climate studies. The goal of this study is to build an AutoML framework that creates pipelines from California’s climatic variables to estimate almond yields. Section 2 introduces the data sources and AutoML model. In section 3, the model is trained and tested with observational records, and future projections are in section 4. 2 Data and Machine Learning Model 2.1 GridMET and Almond Yields Climate variables were derived from the GridMET climate dataset, which provides high-resolution (1/24th degree) daily meteorological data for the contiguous United States from 1979 to the present [7]. Instead of simply using monthly or seasonal averaged climate variables, we extracted climate data from GridMET based on the phenology of almond, such as the specific humidity of the bloom period and chill hours of dormancy. Gridded climate variables were averaged or summed based on the historical location of almond orchards from the CropScape geospatial Cropland Data Layer (CDL) product developed by the United States Department of Agriculture, which maintains the consistency between climate variables and almond yield and improves the accuracy of our analysis [ 8]. Figure 1 depicts the location of almond orchards in California over the past 15 years. Climate data inputs were normalized by removing their mean values and dividing them by their standard deviation. Previous studies have revealed quadratic relationships between climate variables and perennial crops yields in California [ 2]. Therefore, we include a total of 13 phenology-climate variables and their squares as features to the ML model. The county-level almond yields (ton/acre) and planted areas (acre) were reported by the California County Agricultural Commissioners and available on the website of USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) for the period of 1980 to 2020 [ 9]. To account for advancements in farming practices and technological improvements, we include a linear trend variable for each county. In addition, the county names (16 counties) were used as a categorical predictor in our analysis to represent the differences in static factors such as soil properties and agricultural policies among counties.
