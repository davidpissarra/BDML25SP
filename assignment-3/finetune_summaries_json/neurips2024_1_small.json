Here we endeavor to study the problem of detecting disruptions — i.e. plasma instabilities that can cause significant damages, impairing the reliability and efficiency required for their real world viability. Machine learning (ML) prediction models have shown promise in detecting disruptions for specific tokamaks, but they often struggle in generalizing to the diverse characteristics and dynamics of different machines. This limits the effectiveness of ML models across different tokamak designs and operating conditions, which is a critical barrier to scaling fusion technology. Given the success of data augmentation in improving model robustness and generaliz- ability in other fields, this study explores the use of a novel time series viewmaker network to generate diverse augmentations or \"views\" of training data. Our results show that incorporating views during training improves AUC and F2 scores on DisruptionBench tasks compared to standard or no augmentations. This approach represents a promising step towards developing more broadly applicable ML mod- els for disruption avoidance, which is essential for advancing fusion technology and, ultimately, addressing climate change through reliable and sustainable energy production. 1 Introduction One of the most current notable efforts to get an idea from physical sciences into commercializable reality is nuclear fusion. Nuclear fusion has long been considered a “holy grail” in providing carbon- free energy without significant waste or land demands [Giuliani et al., 2023, Spangher et al., 2019]. A leading approach to generating fusion in laboratory plasmas is magnetic confinement via tokamak machines. However, the commercial viability of tokamaks hinges on developing their capability to accurately predict plasma disruptions: losses in plasma stability which may damage a tokamak and take it offline for months at a time. Disruption are difficult to predict with first principles or physics-only models. Thus, a significant focus within the nuclear fusion community has been on the development of machine learning (ML) Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.models for disruption prediction. ML models are already in production at major tokamaks, including random forest predictors and simple neural networks [Rea et al., 2019, Hu et al., 2021, Pautasso et al., 2002], and research into various deep learning architectures has established the state of the art in disruption prediction capabilities [Zhu et al., 2020, Arnold et al., 2023, Spangher et al., 2023a, Zhu et al., 2020]. However, because the characteristics and physical dynamics of a tokamak can change dramatically depending on the machine’s design [Granetz et al., 2018], and over time as the machine is upgraded [Kallenbach et al., 2017] or modified [Greenwald et al., 2014], it is imperative that prediction models can generalize to these different sources of data. Data augmentation is one way to improve model generalizability [Iwana and Uchida, 2021] and robustness [Hong and Travis, 2022]. Since tokamak data is comprised of multivariate time series, common augmentation strategies can include jittering, slicing, and warping [Um et al., 2017, Wen and Keyes, 2019]. However, naively applying these techniques can lead to augmentations that fail to mimic plausible plasma behavior, impairing the model’s ability to learn patterns relevant for disruption prediction [Fu et al., 2020]. Previously, a Stutent t process based approach has been used for tokamak data [Katharina et al., 2022], however it’s direct impact on post-hoc models was not evaluated. In this work, we explore the use of “Viewmaker Networks” [Tamkin et al., 2021], models which learn to generate augmentations through adversarial learning. We hypothesize that viewmaker augmentations, or “views\", are a solution for incorporating realistic yet diverse augmentations of disruption data which can improve the robustness of models toward disruptive discharges, and we demonstrate that using views in training which improve model AUC and F2 on DisruptionBench [Spangher et al., 2024] tasks over multiple disruption prediction models when compared to training on standard augmentations such as those present in the tsaug library or training without augmentation. The novelty of our paper is as follows: (1) We present an original adaptation of the image-based viewmaker network for time series augmentation and benchmark against other time series augmentation techniques. (2) We are the first to rigorously test generative augmentation methods in the context of nuclear fusion datasets. 2 Background Disruption benchmarks: DisruptionBench [Spangher et al., 2024] is the first disruption prediction benchmark aimed at assessing model generalizability across tokamaks. The data is comprised of roughly 30k trials (referred to here as “discharges”) from three tokamaks: General Atomics’ DIII-D, MIT’s\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
