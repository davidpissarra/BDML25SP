The report confirms that warming in  the climate system is unequivocal, with many of the observed changes  unprecedented over decades to millennia: warming of the atmosphere  and the ocean, diminishing snow and ice, rising sea levels and increas - ing concentrations of greenhouse gases. Each of the last three decades  has been successively warmer at the Earth’s surface than any preced - ing decade since 1850.  These and other findings confirm and enhance our scientific under - standing of the climate system and the role of greenhouse gas emis - sions; as such, the report demands the urgent attention of both policy - makers and the general public. As an intergovernmental body jointly established in 1988 by the World  Meteorological Organization (WMO) and the United Nations Environ - ment Programme (UNEP), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate  Change (IPCC) has provided policymakers with the most authorita - tive and objective scientific and technical assessments. Beginning in  1990, this series of IPCC Assessment Reports, Special Reports, Tech - nical Papers, Methodology Reports and other products have become  standard works of reference.  This Working Group I contribution to the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment  Report contains important new scientific knowledge that can be used  to produce climate information and services for assisting society to act  to address the challenges of climate change. The timing is particularly  significant, as this information provides a new impetus, through clear  and indisputable physical science, to those negotiators responsible for  concluding a new agreement under the United Nations Framework  Convention on Climate Change in 2015. Climate change is a long-term challenge, but one that requires urgent  action given the pace and the scale by which greenhouse gases are  accumulating in the atmosphere and the risks of a more than 2 degree  Celsius temperature rise. Today we need to focus on the fundamentals  and on the actions otherwise the risks we run will get higher with  every year.  This Working Group I assessment was made possible thanks to the  commitment and dedication of many hundreds of experts worldwide,  representing a wide range of disciplines. WMO and UNEP are proud  that so many of the experts belong to their communities and networks.  We express our deep gratitude to all authors, review editors and expert  reviewers for devoting their knowledge, expertise and time.
