The advent of smart meters and smart grids provide an unprecedented advantage in realizing an optimised supply of thermal energies through proactive techniques such as load forecasting. In this paper, we propose a forecasting framework for heat demand based on neural networks where the time series are encoded as scalograms equipped with the capacity of embedding exogenous variables such as weather, and holiday/non-holiday. Subsequently, CNNs are utilized to predict the heat load multi-step ahead. Finally, the proposed framework is compared with other state-of-the-art methods, such as SARIMAX and LSTM. The quantitative results from retrospective experiments show that the proposed framework consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline method with real-world data acquired from Denmark. A minimal mean error of 7.54% for MAPE and 417kW for RMSE is achieved with the proposed framework in comparison to all other methods. 1 Introduction In the current global scenario, the world is focused on gaining momentum in minimizing its carbon footprint. In 2020,90% of the global heat supply was fueled by fossil fuels, and although significant technological advances have been made, the global energy requirement for space and water heating has been stable since 2010 [1], [2]. With an increasing urgency for conscious energy utilization, a reliable approach to predicting heat demand is imperative. The nature of the heat consumption data is in the form of a time series which is a set of data samples that provide information as a consequence of their sequential nature. Time series forecasting is the process of predicting target values at a future time period from observed historical data. The complexity of heat demand forecasting arises owing to its non-linear nature induced by human behavioral patterns, dependency on weather [3], working/non-working days [4], building properties [5], etc., imparting daily, weekly and seasonal patterns. Such complex dependencies make the heat demand forecasting problem multi-dimensional. State-of-the-art heat forecasting methods can be categorized into three groups - statistical mod- els, machine learning, and deep learning models. Statistical methods that are regression-based include Auto-regressive Moving Average (ARMA), Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Seasonal ARIMA with eXogenous factors (SARIMAX), Auto-regressive Conditional *These authors contributed equally to this work Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and their variants [6], [7]. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) are also used in the context of time series forecasting as standalone and or as hybrid models with statistical models [8], [9], [10]. Deep learning methods are currently at the forefront of time series forecasting as a consequence of their ability to learn non-linear functions through universal function approximators. Architectures such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and its progressive variants leverages the sequential nature of time series data to forecast future target values [11], [12], [13], [14]. An overlooked aspect of forecasting is the frequency component of the time series. Many real-life data are a complex aggregation of disparate components. With advances in signal processing, such time series signals can be transformed into a time-scale representation in the form of a scalogram using Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT). A scalogram is analogous to an image that represents the coefficients of CWT in time and scale as its two spatial coordinates with detailed time-frequency resolution compared to a spectrogram which is limited with fixed window size, thus enabling a multi- resolution feature analysis of the time series. The scales are inversely proportional to frequencies. This essentially shifts the domain from time series to computer vision where Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are employed for image classification, and object recognition among others. We leverage this image-like representation of the time series to learn localised time-frequency features, discerning different frequencies at different points of time [15], [16]. Considering the multi-faceted forecasting challenge, we propose a framework contributing the following: (1) A deep learning based forecasting model for short-term 24 hours ahead heat demand at a district level; (2)A multi-resolution representation (Scalogram) based framework capturing localized non-linear time-frequency features of heat demand with exogenous variables; (3) Capacity of the framework to forecast in different seasons and evaluate its performance with existing standard deep learning and statistical method. 2 Method Overview The core methodology of our framework (Figure 1) relies upon multi-step sequence-to-sequence prediction with the ability to process multi-resolution representation\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
