These methods are cost prohibitive for developing countries, and are not globally standardized, leading to inaccurate emissions reports from nations and companies. I developed a low-cost solution via an end-to-end deep learning pipeline that utilizes observations of emitted smoke plumes in satellite imagery to provide an accu- rate, precise system for quantifying power plant GHG emis- sions by segmentation of power plant smoke plumes, classi- fication of the plant fossil fuels, and algorithmic prediction of power generation and CO 2emissions. The pipeline was able to achieve a segmentation Intersection Over Union (IoU) score of 0.841, fuel classification accuracy of 92%, and quan- tify power generation and CO 2emission rates with R2val- ues of 0.852 and 0.824 respectively. The results of this work serve as a step toward the low-cost monitoring and detection of major sources of GHG emissions, helping limit their catas- trophic impacts on climate and our planet. Introduction Fossil-fuel power plants are one of the largest emitters of Greenhouse gasses, accounting for 73% of the U.S.’ GHG emissions and 65% of global GHG emissions (on Cli- mate Change and Edenhofer 2014). The pollutants produced by these emissions serve as major contributors to the climate crisis and have had devastating impacts on air quality and the environment. GHG emissions cause 8.7 million deaths per year and have increased the frequency of natural disas- ters such as wildfires and powerful storms five fold (Smol 2012). These public health and environmental impacts cost billions in annual damages. Preventing the permanent effects of climate change and air pollution requires identifying the sources and distribu- tions of GHG emissions on a precise scale. However, keep- ing track of GHG emissions from all global power plants is difficult, as the quality of emissions data varies depending on Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

For example, in a developed country such as the United States, every major power plant has on-site Continuous Emissions Monitoring Systems (CEMS) that reports data to the Envi- ronmental Protection Agency. But these systems are very ex- pensive, costing over $500,000 for installation and $20,000 annually for maintenance (US EPA 2016), making them im- practical for use in many lesser-developed countries. Ad- ditionally, the lack of reliable infrastructure causes many countries to provide vague, inaccurate, and outdated esti- mations of their GHG emissions. An examination of GHG emission reports from 196 countries found gaps in nation’s declared emissions versus estimates by the United Nations totalling to 10.6 billion tons of globally under-reported emis- sions per year (Mooney et al.). These issues require new, low-cost alternatives to estimate and report GHG emissions on a more precise scale. In recent years, the use of satellite data has emerged as a potential candidate to monitor the progression of climate change and global warming (Boesch et al. 2021). Equipped with an array of sensors and instruments to measure various atmospheric conditions, spectrometer satellites have helped inform our understanding of the dynamics of changes in Earth’s tem- perature. Launched in 2009 and 2014, spectrometer satellite missions Greenhouse Gasses Observing Satellite (GOSAT) and Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2) have provided carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission data on a global and national level (Eldering et al. 2017). However, spectrometer satellite instruments are imprecise and low-resolution ( ≥10 km res- olution), and cannot identify the granular emissions ( ≤2km) of individual power plants (Apte et al. 2017). When active, fossil-fuel burning power plants emit a smoke plume as a byproduct of the electricity generation process. These plumes can be captured by optical satellite imagery and fed into a deep learning model to produce accu- rate estimates of the plant’s GHG emissions (Cusworth et al. 2021). Pairing deep learning with high-resolution optical satellite imagery serves as a promising method to estimate power plant GHG emissions with accuracy rates near spec- trometer measurements, while simultaneously maintaining the ability to monitor emissions on a global scale. More- over, this method does not require huge investments or elab- orate infrastructure, serving as a low-cost alternative to fill-ing long existing gaps in emissions data around the world. In this work, I present an end-to-end deep learning pipeline to estimate CO 2emissions, the most dominant greenhouse gas in the atmosphere, at an individual power-plant scale.
