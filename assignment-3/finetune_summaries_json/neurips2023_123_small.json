Significant investment into renewable energy infrastructure from the past decade has dramatically increased the amount of wind and solar deployed on grids around the world from 630 TWh in 2012 to over 3,400 TWh in 2022 [8]. However, as renewable generation increases, the amount of energy curtailed due to oversupply during certain hours also increases. Figure 1: Median (solid line) and 25%-75% range (shaded) of curtailment values, aggregated by time of day, for SPP (primarily wind curtailment) and CAISO (primarily solar curtailment).As intermittent renewable energy generation be- comes increasingly prevalent, the risk of curtail- ment grows significantly [13]. Curtailment is a key challenge facing the world where power grids are decarbonized. For example, 5-15% of the renewable energy generated is curtailed in Europe and China respectively [2]. In the US, in 2022, SPP curtailed over 11,000 GWh of wind energy, which was more than 10% of all wind energy produced in the region [16]. CAISO curtailed almost 2,450 GWh of renewable en- ergy which was almost 7% of all solar energy produced [9], as illustrated in Figure 1. The curtailment is happening frequently as well, oc- curring at some location in CAISO over 30% of all time steps in 2021, and over 60% of all times in ERCOT and SPP. The frequent occurrence of curtailment means that there is opportunity for greater emissions reductions through careful load management. Historically, dispatchable fossil resources were matched to electricity demand from consumers. We now have the opportunity to reverse that paradigm and match demand to variable renewable energy supply to sop up the excess clean energy. Flexible loads, like electric vehicle charging, hot water heating with heat pumps, and delay-tolerant computation in datacenters [1, 11, 14] can be scheduled to take advantage of this low emissions electricity. For example, managed EV charging can reduce associated emissions by up to 65% [4]. But to take advantage of this curtailed renewable energy, we need to accurately predict when and where curtailment occurs â€” a challenging problem due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy production. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2 ML for Curtailment Prediction Understanding when and where renewable energy curtailment occurs provides a massive opportunity for emissions reductions. When renewable energy is oversupplied, or is constrained by transmission capacities, it is curtailed. If users could increase load at the times and near places where curtailment occurs, electricity usage is increased without the associated emission overhead, having near-zero marginal emissions during that time. For example, managed EV charging can reduce associated emissions by up to 65% [4]. In addition to lowering carbon emissions, reducing curtailment increases revenues for renewable energy owners and reduces the overall system costs for grid consumers. As renewable development continues, the opportunity to reduce emissions through load flexibility will increase in magnitude, frequency and location. Temporal and spatial granularity of the models are crucial to detect andforecast the curtailments accurately. Temporal Granularity: Curtailment can vary significantly from one 5-minute settlement period of the Independent System Operators (ISO)1. See Appendix Figure 3 for an example five minute-level time series and Figure 4 for an example of seasonal trends. This means that a successful curtailment prediction model needs to operate at a granularity finer than hourly. Spatial Granularity: While curtailment can be a widespread phenomenon, it is most frequently localized to a subsection of the ISO grid due to transmission constraints. This means that the geographic granularity needs to be smaller than at the ISO level. Fortunately, there is a growing resource of ground-truth data about curtailment available now. Many ISOs publish ground truth curtailment data with varying time delays, typically 30 to 90 days, although some may be as soon as a day or up to a year delay. The data can have different levels of spatial granularity. Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of the ISO-specific datasets. Unfortunately not all ISOs provide nodal level granularity. However we propose using locational marginal pricing (LMP) data to serve as a replacement for granular ground truth data. 2.1 Detecting Curtailment Using Nodal Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) Data While detailed information of where curtailed energy is not always available, many ISOs provide detailed nodal locational marginal pricing (LMP) data realtime. Not all markets globally use nodal LMP for dispatch, however all major ISOs in the US have moved to a nodal LMP structure.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nDecarbonizing electricity grids in a reliable and cost-effective manner is crucial for a clean energy future. Over the past decade, significant investment in renewable energy infrastructure has led to a substantial increase in wind and solar deployment on grids worldwide, from 630 TWh in 2012 to over 3,400 TWh in 2022. However, as renewable generation increases, so does the amount of energy curtailed due to oversupply during certain hours. \n\nAs intermittent renewable energy generation becomes more prevalent, the risk of curtailment grows significantly. Curtailment is a major challenge facing the world as power grids are decarbonized. For instance, 5-15% of renewable energy generated is curtailed in Europe and China, respectively. In the US, in 2022, the Southwest Power Pool (SPP) curtailed over 11,000 GWh of wind energy, which was more than 10% of all wind energy produced in the region. The California Independent System Operator (CAISO) curtailed almost 2,450 GWh of renewable energy, which was almost 7% of all solar energy produced.\n\nCurtailment occurs frequently, with instances happening at some locations in CAISO over 30% of all time steps in 2021, and over 60% of all times in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) and SPP. The frequent occurrence of curtailment presents an opportunity for greater emissions reductions through careful load management. Historically, dispatchable fossil resources were matched to electricity demand from consumers. Now, we have the opportunity to reverse this paradigm and match demand to variable renewable energy supply to absorb excess clean energy.\n\nFlexible loads, such as electric vehicle charging, hot water heating with heat pumps, and delay-tolerant computation in data centers, can be scheduled to take advantage of this low-emissions electricity. For example, managed EV charging can reduce associated emissions by up to 65%. To take advantage of curtailed renewable energy, we need to accurately predict when and where curtailment occurs, a challenging problem due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy production.\n\nUnderstanding when and where renewable energy curtailment occurs provides a massive opportunity for emissions reductions. When renewable energy is oversupplied or constrained by transmission capacities, it is curtailed. If users could increase load at the times and locations where curtailment occurs, electricity usage can be increased without the associated emission overhead, resulting in near-zero marginal emissions during that time. In addition to lowering carbon emissions, reducing curtailment increases revenues for renewable energy owners and reduces the overall system costs for grid consumers.\n\nAs renewable development continues, the opportunity to reduce emissions through load flexibility will increase in magnitude, frequency, and location. Temporal and spatial granularity of models are crucial to detect and forecast curtailments accurately.

We propose using locational marginal pricing (LMP) data as a replacement for granular ground-truth data. LMP data is available in real-time from many ISOs, and it can be used to detect curtailment.\n\nDetecting curtailment using LMP data is a promising approach. While detailed information about where curtailed energy is not always available, many ISOs provide detailed nodal LMP data in real-time. Since the majority of curtailment in current markets is localized, LMP data can be used to identify areas where curtailment is occurring."
