To address this issue, we propose a double machine learning approach to obtain unbiased, spatially-explicit estimates of the effect of the built environment on travel-related CO 2emissions for each neighborhood by controlling for residential self-selection. We examine how socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes moderate the effect and how it decomposes across the 5Ds of the built environment. Based on a case study for Berlin and the travel diaries of 32,000 residents, we find that the built environment causes household travel-related CO 2emissions to differ by a factor of almost two between central and suburban neighborhoods in Berlin. To highlight the practical importance for urban climate mitigation, we evaluate current plans for 64,000 new residential units in terms of total induced transport CO 2emissions. Our findings underscore the significance of spatially differentiated compact development to decarbonize the transport sector. 1 Introduction The built environment plays a critical role in facilitating or hindering the decarbonization of urban transport [ 1]. The location and compactness of new residential development shape and constrain residents’ future travel behavior. As such, they limit the mitigation potential of mobility-related lifestyle changes and potentially lock in transport-related emissions for decades [ 2]. Urban sprawl and suburban development, in particular, have been widely criticized for increasing car dependence and travel demand, hindering the decarbonization of urban transport [ 3]. Many studies have observed that residents of urban (central, higher-density, mixed-use) neighborhoods tend to drive less and instead walk [ 4,5,6,7], bike [ 4], and use public transit more [ 8,9] than residents of suburban (non-central, lower-density, single-use residential) neighborhoods. Yet, it is ambiguous to what extent these differences can be attributed to the built environment itself, as opposed to pre-existing differences in travel preferences between residents of urban and suburban neighborhoods. These differences are a result of a process known as residential self-selection [ 10], in which people choose their place of residence based on, among other things, locally available transport options matching their pre-existing travel preferences. Failing to account for residential self-selection and the resulting differences in travel preferences among residents of different neighborhoods can lead to falsely Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.attributing observed differences in travel behavior to the built environment alone, overestimating its impact and drawing biased conclusions [11]. Two strands in literature aim to uncover the built environment’s influence on travel behavior, one focusing on the nonlinearity of the relationship using machine learning methods, in particular decision tree ensembles [ 12,13], the other focusing on disentangling the influence from the confounding effect of residential self-selection using statistical methods such as statistical control, propensity score matching, and sample selection [14]. We aim to bring both approaches together. We explore the potential of the causal inference method double machine learning (DML) [ 15] to examine the non-linear effect of the built environment on travel behavior from mobility survey data while accounting for confounding factors. We assess the built environment’s impact across multiple, continuous dimensions, specifically the 5Ds [ 16], density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance from transit, which all are presumed to have independent effects on travel behavior [ 11]. We control for the non-linear influence of socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes that are responsible for residential self-selection [ 14]. We examine the impact on travel behavior in terms of travel-related emissions to account for changes in both, travel distances and mode choice, allowing for a comprehensive assessment of the climate-related impacts of the built environment. We demonstrate our approach using the city of Berlin, Germany, as a case study and discuss local implications for low-carbon urban planning. Our research questions are the following: 1.What is the isolated effect of the built environment on travel behavior and induced CO 2 emissions when accounting for residential self-selection for each neighborhood in Berlin? 2.How does the effect decompose into the 5Ds and how is it moderated by socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes? 3.What are the induced transport CO 2emissions of currently planned housing projects in Berlin and how can the spatial allocation be improved to most effectively reduce emissions? 2 Methods 2.1 Preprocessing Data sources. Representative travel behavior per neighborhood is obtained from travel diaries of the German national mobility survey \"Mobilität in Städten – SrV 2018\" [ 17], which includes more than 100,000 trips for Berlin. To describe the built environment, we use only publicly available data from OpenStreetMap [ 18] on the street network and points of interest, from the public transit operator VBB on transit accessibility (GTFS data) [ 19] and from Berlin’s open data portal [ 20] on population density, land-use, street greenery, street space allocation\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
