Balaji Schmidt Futures, IPSL Abstract Climate General Circulation Models (GCMs) constitute the primary tools for cli- mate projections that inform IPCC Assessment Reports. Calibrating, or tuning the parameters of the models can significantly improve their predictions, thus their scientific and societal impacts. Unfortunately, traditional tuning techniques remain time-consuming and computationally costly, even at coarse resolution. A specific challenge for the tuning of climate models lies in the tuning of both fast and slow climatic features: while atmospheric processes adjust on hourly to weekly timescales, vegetation or ocean dynamics drive mechanisms of variability at decadal to millenial timescales. In this work, we explore whether and how History Matching, which uses machine learning based emulators to accelerate and automate the tuning process, is relevant for tuning climate models with multiple timescales. To facilitate this exploration, we work with a climate model of interme- diate complexity, yet test experimental tuning protocols that can be directly applied to more complex GCMs to reduce uncertainty in climate projections. 1 Introduction General Circulation Models (hereafter GCMs), widely used to produce simulations of the past, present and future climate, which subsequently inform the IPCC [1,2], include parameters that are more or less constrained by theory or observations (for example snow albedo). Some of these parameters are introduced as the physical equations are discretized to enable numerical computation, for example related to unresolved or ill-resolved processes which effects are parameterized (for example horizontal diffusion in the ocean). Even when direct measurements of these parameters are available, they may not be optimal for a given model as the latter remains one imperfect mathematical representation of the Earth system. Calibration of climate model parameters, aka tuning, is driven by two motivations. First, it allows increased performances on specific prediction tasks: it is the Fitness-for-Purpose paradigm [2]. Climate model simulations will gain importance in the years to come with the need for accurate predictions of climate change to guide adaptation, which constitute climate services [3]. Secondly, tuning the models can also help quantifying their uncertainties [2], in the process of improving Earth modelling as well as understanding the causes of climate change to inform mitigation policies. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.GCMs are state-of-the-art in climate modelling: the 2021 Nobel prizes in Physics even honored some of the pioneering work done to support the development of GCMs [4]. However they come with a computational price: running a GCM for a hundred years prediction can take up to several weeks on the top High-Performance Computing centers. This makes traditional tuning-by-hand techniques too costly. Extensive grid search [5] techniques are also near impossible in practice which call for more intelligent techniques based on surrogate modeling. History Matching (HM) is a well established technique [6,7] that can improve and accelerate this tuning, and that recently attracted attention in the climate modeling community. HM makes use of an emulator to replace the climate model in the exploration of the parameters’ space. For example, Lguensat et al. [8] applied HM to tune a classical toy model, Lorenz–96, coupling slow and fast variables as a simple analogy to an ocean-atmosphere model, they highlight the challenges induced by the multiple timescales. In this work, we consider iLOVECLIM [9], an Earth system Model of Intermediate Complexity (EMIC), which presents way more complex physical processes than a simple toy model. Following Loutre et al. [10], Shi et al. [11], we explore the parameters’ sensitivity of iLOVECLIM for present-day climate simulations, we then perform a HM-based tuning of this model and present our conclusions. 2 Materials and Methods Model, choice of parameters and ground truth We consider the iLOVECLIM Earth system model, derived from the LOVECLIM model by Goosse et al.
