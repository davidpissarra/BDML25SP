However, due to the extremely high computational cost required, this simulation-based approach can only be run for a limited amount of time within a limited area. To address this, we developed new models using emerging machine learning approaches that leverage a plethora of satellite observations providing long-term global spatial coverage. In particular, our machine learning models are capable of capturing the key process of precipitation formation which greatly control cloud lifetime, namely autoconversion rates – the term used to describe the collision and coalescence of cloud droplets responsible for raindrop formation. We validate the performance of our models against simulation data, showing that our models are capable of predicting the autoconversion rates fairly well. 1 Introduction Climate change represents one of the most pressing challenges afflicting our societies, with gov- ernments worldwide, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders placing increasing emphasis on measures to successfully tackle and mitigate its adverse effects. A pressing scientific challenge relates to the need to understand aerosol-cloud interactions because these currently rep- resent one of the major sources of uncertainty in determining the radiative forcing responsible for climate change projections (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2021 - IPCC [2021]). While aerosols directly affect climate through scattering and absorbing the solar radiation, they also affect climate indirectly through altering the properties of clouds which impacts Earth’s energy budget. In particular, increases in aerosol concentrations can lead to a decrease in the cloud droplet radii which increase the albedo of clouds (radiative forcing due to aerosol-cloud interactions, RFaci - Twomey [1974]). Simultaneously, the smaller size of cloud droplets will hence reduce precipitation efficiency and increase the lifetime of cloud (one important adjustment to RFaci - Albrecht [1989], Gryspeerdt et al. [2019], Bellouin et al. [2020]). Understanding the complex interactions within the Earth (i.e., the interaction between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation) is possible through climate models. However, considering the complexity of the climate system, it is unfeasible to explain all processes occurring on Earth simultaneously. Climate Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.models numerically solve the differential equations describing the fluid dynamics of the atmosphere and ocean on a discrete grid. Processes that are smaller than the grid-scale of the model cannot be solved directly and are thus poorly represented (IPCC [2021]). Therefore, in order to better represent small-scale processes in the atmosphere, there has been a shift towards developing high-resolution models with smaller grid cells. Newest developments allow for very-high-resolution simulations in realistic, weather prediction mode, albeit over limited spatial domains and for short time periods only. One of the high-resolution simulations that can be used to simulate small-scale processes in the atmosphere is the ICON-LEM (Dipankar et al. [2015], Heinze et al. [2017]). However, to run such a model for 1 simulated hour, it would take 13 hours on 300 computer nodes, costing about EUR 100,000 per simulated day (Costa-Surós et al. [2020]). Due to its large computational costs, it is impractical to run such a model in larger spatial domains or for a longer period of time. Meanwhile, the use of machine learning in climate science has not yet been fully explored, despite its tremendous revolutionary impact on many fields of research (Rolnick et al. [2019]). The availability of large datasets coupled with increased computing power has accelerated the development of machine learning, leading to impressive results in solving various challenging problems (Reuther et al. [2019]). It is conjectured that these recent advances in machine learning will enable climate science to make big leaps forward, specifically to better understand the impact of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions on climate. The overarching objective of this study is therefore to contribute to our understanding of aerosol- cloud-precipitation-climate interactions by leveraging emerging machine learning approaches. In particular, we developed machine learning models capable of capturing one aspect of precipitation formation that leverage a plethora of satellite observations – which offer global spatial coverage up to several decades – in order to estimate the autoconversion rates. There have been a variety of parameterizations of autoconversion rates developed in the past, such as Berry [1967], Kessler [1969], Manton and Cotton [1977], Baker [1993], Khairoutdinov and Kogan [2000], Liu and Daum [2004], Seifert and Beheng [2006], among numerous others. Attempts to predict autoconversion rates by using machine learning have also been widely undertaken in the last few years, such as Seifert and Rasp [2020], Chiu et al. [2021], Alfonso and Zamora [2021], etc. Existing studies are primarily concerned with estimating autoconversion rates in climate models, whereas our study estimates\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nClimate change represents one of the most pressing challenges facing our societies, with governments, non-governmental organizations, and other stakeholders emphasizing measures to mitigate its adverse effects. A key scientific challenge is understanding aerosol-cloud interactions, which are a major source of uncertainty in climate change projections. Aerosols affect climate directly by scattering and absorbing solar radiation, and indirectly by altering cloud properties, impacting Earth's energy budget. Increased aerosol concentrations can lead to smaller cloud droplet radii, increasing cloud albedo and reducing precipitation efficiency, while also increasing cloud lifetime.\n\nClimate models can explain complex interactions between aerosols, clouds, and precipitation, but the complexity of the climate system makes it difficult to simulate all processes simultaneously. High-resolution models with smaller grid cells can better represent small-scale processes, but are computationally expensive and can only be run for short periods over limited areas. The ICON-LEM model, for example, requires 13 hours on 300 computer nodes to simulate one hour, at a cost of approximately EUR 100,000 per simulated day.\n\nTo address this challenge, we developed machine learning models that leverage satellite observations for long-term global coverage. Our models can capture key processes, such as autoconversion rates, which describe the collision and coalescence of cloud droplets responsible for raindrop formation.

Recent studies have also used machine learning to predict autoconversion rates, such as Seifert and Rasp [2020] and Chiu et al. [2021]. Our study differs from existing work by estimating autoconversion rates using machine learning models that leverage satellite observations for global spatial coverage."
