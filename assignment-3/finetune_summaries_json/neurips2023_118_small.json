However, ex- cessive and unregulated sand mining in the Global South has high socio-economic and environmental costs, and amplifies the effects of climate change. Sand mines are characterized by informality and high temporal variability, and data on the location and extent of these mines tends to be sparse. We propose to build custom sand-mine detection tools by fine-tuning foundation models for earth observation, which leverage self supervised learning - a cost-effective and powerful approach in sparse data regimes. Our preliminary results show that these methods outper- form fully supervised approaches, with the best performing model achieving an average precision score of 0.57 for this challenging task. These tools allow for real-time monitoring of sand mining activity and can enable more effective policy and regulation, to inform sustainable development. 1 Introduction Sustainable sand mining is one of the main ecological challenges of the 21st century[ 1–3]. Driven by rapid urbanization and economic growth1, sand mining activity has tripled over the last 20 years, and accounts for 85% of all mineral extraction[ 4]. The demand for sand is expected to increase many-fold, given the key role of sand-intensive infrastructure in aiding the transition to a low-carbon society2[5] and development. Across the Global South, much of this sand is mined from riverbeds and riverbanks, and has acute socio-economic and environmental costs. In particular, it threatens to amplify the impacts of climate change by accelerating flooding, erosion and biodiversity loss[ 1,6]. Despite these adverse consequences, sand mining remains nearly unregulated in most parts of the world, especially in India where the rate of extraction already far exceeds sustainable levels [ 7–9]. Thus, urgent action is vital to prevent a global sand crisis [10]. The highly pervasive nature of sand mining makes physical monitoring near impossible, given the scale of the task and the dangers involved [ 2,11]. While the use of satellite imagery to detect 1Sand constitutes 70-85% of concrete and asphalt, critical for construction, roads, and other infrastructure 2Demand is expected to increase from municipal infrastructure, utilities, social infrastructure and buildings.

As a result, sand mines are commonly unrepresented in general purpose mine detection tools, most of which focus on metal extraction. We propose to address these challenges by using self-supervised learning (SSL), in combination with open-access medium-resolution satellite imagery, and a new dataset of hand-crafted labels to build a custom sand mine detection tool. The overarching goal of our project is to produce, and enable the continued production of high-resolution, real-time maps of sand mining activity. Thus far, a small body of literature has examined the use of satellite imagery and machine learning to map global distributions of sand deposits [ 16–19]. This project expands on these ideas, and contributes to the research on the use of satellite imagery and machine learning to monitor mining activity [ 12,14,20]. In particular, we leverage advances in SSL methods that have recently seen success in the context of earth observation (EO) [ 21–26]. Here, a global corpus of unlabeled multispectral remote sensing datasets are used to learn semantic representations of the planet’s surface from freely available satellite imagery. These pre-trained models, often referred to as foundation models for earth observation (FMEO), have shown impressive performance on downstream tasks such as object detection and image segmentation [ 23]. Most importantly, FMEOs typically exploit all available multi-spectral bands of optical imagery, and some additionally use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. From existing work on mapping sand and gravel using remote sensing [ 16,18,27–29], we know that RGB, shortwave infrared, thermal bands, and SAR comprise the bands of importance, underscoring the importance of FMEOs in this transfer learning paradigm. Our approach will test the ability of these models to generalize to sand mine segmentation, a novel and perhaps more challenging task than these models have been tested on previously. In the process we build an understanding of the best practices required to fine tune these models, especially under distribution shifts. In our analysis, we compare and contrast the performance of FMEOs with that of fully-supervised approaches. 2 Data and Methods Figure 1: Mining signatures and seasonal variability: Both panels show a section of the river Betwa, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India.
