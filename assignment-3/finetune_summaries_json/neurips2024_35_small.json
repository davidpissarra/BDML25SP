Inertial confinement fusion (ICF) experiments trigger nuclear reactions by firing lasers at a fuel target, typically composed of deuterium and tritium. These experiments are costly and require complex optimization of the laser pulse shape across multiple shots to maximize energy yield. Even though Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been commonly used to optimize such expensive scientific experiments, vanilla BO methods do not leverage prior knowledge of the function from simulations or past experiments and fail to achieve high sample efficiency. In this work, we adapted and explored BO meta-learning techniques for ICF that either meta-learn the BO surrogate model, the acquisition function, or both from simulations. Our results demonstrate that the three meta-learning tech- niques we investigated, Meta-Learning Acquisition Functions for BO (MetaBO), Rank-Weighted Gaussian Process Ensemble (RGPE), and Neural Acquisition Pro- cesses (NAP), drastically reduce the number of experiments needed to achieve a satisfactory yield in ICF simulations.

ICF experiments are complex and exceptionally costly because of the extreme conditions needed to achieve nuclear fusion. The high expenses and the limited number of ICF facilities lead to very few opportunities for experimentation, often just a few times a year. So the development and study of ICF optimization techniques that can utilize data in a sample-efficient manner is critical. To our knowledge, this work is the first to study the application of meta-learning BO techniques in ICF, augmenting BO from previous experiments or simulations. We specifically study three classes of BO meta-learning techniques: •MetaBO (V olpp et al., 2020) which meta-learns the acquisition function using Reinforcement Learning (RL). •Rank-Weighted Gaussian Process Ensemble (RGPE) (Feurer et al., 2022) which uses an ensemble of Gaussian Processes as the surrogate model. •Neural Acquisition Process (NAP) (Maraval et al., 2023) which simultaneously meta-learns the surrogate model and the acquisition process in an end-to-end manner. We show that meta-learning improves the performance of BO by increasing the effectiveness of the optimization process in ICF. Figure 2: NAP’s meta-learned surrogate predictions: (left) without any context points; (middle) after three context points; (right) the optimization target function. NAP achieves rapid adaptation with high sample efficiency, which is ideal for the limited ICF experiments possible on a shot day, given only a few shot days occur annually. For clarity, two of the five dimensions are plotted here. 2 Background 2.1 ICF Figure 3: An example laser pulse shape used in ICF experiments. The shape is controlled by 5 parameters.
