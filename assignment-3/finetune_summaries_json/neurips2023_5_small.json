Measurement of GHG emissions associated with products is crucial to quantify the impact of GHG emission abatement actions. Life cycle assessment (LCA), the scientific discipline for measuring GHG emissions, estimates the environmental impact of a product. Scaling LCA to millions of products is challenging as it requires extensive manual analysis by domain experts. To avoid repetitive analysis, environmental impact factors (EIF) of common materials and products are published for use by experts. However, finding appropriate EIFs for even a single product can require hundreds of hours of manual work, especially for complex products. We present Flamingo, an algorithm that leverages neural language models to automatically identify an appropriate EIF given a text description. A key challenge in automation is that EIF databases are incomplete. Flamingo uses industry sector classification as an intermediate layer to identify when there are no good matches in the database. On a dataset of 664 products, Flamingo achieves an EIF matching precision of 75%. 1 Introduction Life cycle assessment (LCA) is a standard method used to estimate GHG emissions associated with an activity or a product. These emissions are often referred to as its carbon footprint, and are reported in terms of global-warming potential in units of mass of carbon dioxide equivalent [ Gao et al.(2014) ]. LCA estimates emissions in each stage of a product: raw material extraction, manufacturing, trans- portation, use, and disposal/reuse. The effort to acquire direct measurements for each aspect can be prohibitively expensive [ Tasaki et al.(2017) ], and therefore, domain experts use the outputs of existing LCA studies to estimate emissions of common materials, products, and activities associated with the life cycle of their subject [ Wernet et al.(2016) ]. E.g., an LCA on the \"production of a cotton t-shirt\" might rely on the results of LCAs focused on \"cotton production\" or \"transport by truck\". We Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Environmental impact factor (EIF) selection is a key aspect of product carbon footprinting. Flamingo automates selection of an EIF using pre-trained neural language models. It uses industry sector codes to identify when an EIF is not available in the database. refer to the outputs of these reference LCA studies as environment impact factors (EIFs). Databases such as Ecoinvent [Wernet et al.(2016)] collate these EIFs for use by LCA practitioners. There is a lack of automation tools that integrate with EIF datasets. Often, EIFs are shared as spreadsheets, and experts use string matching or explicit rules to match an activity to an appropriate EIF [ Rovelli et al.(2022) ]. It can take hundreds of hours to match EIFs for LCA of even a single product [ Meinrenken et al.(2012) ]. To mitigate manual overhead, we propose using natural language processing (NLP) based machine learning (ML) methods to perform this matching. To our knowledge, we are the first to study use of neural ML based EIF matching. A simple approach is to use neural language models trained on web data for semantic textual similarity [ Reimers and Gurevych(2019) ], where the EIFs can be matched based on the distance between the embedding of the query and the EIF texts. A major advantage of this approach is that no training data is required, as off-the-shelf pre-trained models can capture synonyms and conceptual relationships. A key characteristic of the EIF matching problem is that the databases are incomplete. Many products such as mushrooms or socks do not have an EIF, because either no LCA study exists or the published LCAs have not been ingested into the database. LCA experts search across multiple databases for a match, and use an approximate value with higher uncertainty when no match exists, e.g., average EIF of vegetables as a proxy for red bell peppers [ Clark et al.(2022) ]. However, pre-trained ML models are not trained to identify when an appropriate match does not exist. We present a novel zero-shot ML algorithm, called Flamingo, that introduces an intermediate classifi- cation layer in semantic search to identify when an EIF is missing, and improves the performance of EIF matches. Flamingo classifies the input query text to a standard industry code, and uses semantic text matching to identify the closest EIFs within the industry code. When there are no EIFs available for an industry code, Flamingo predicts that no appropriate match exists. We use an industry sector classification called the Harmonized System (HS) code [ Chaplin(1987) ], which is specifically de- signed for categorizing products based on their material composition and manufacturing complexity. HS codes are hierarchically organized, are used globally for import/export taxes, and are refreshed by the World Customs Organization every 5\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
