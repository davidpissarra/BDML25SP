This work proposes CityTFT, a data-driven UBEM framework, to accurately model the energy demands in urban environments. With the empowerment of the underlying TFT framework and an augmented loss function, CityTFT could predict heating and cooling triggers in unseen climate dynamics with an F1 score of 99.98 % while RMSE of loads of 13.57 kWh. 1 Introduction Urbanization is one of the greatest challenges of modern society. Almost one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions come from buildings and 70% of energy is consumed by urban. As of the latest available data in 2021, the global population stood at over 7.8 billion individuals [ 1]. Projections indicate that in 2050 [ 2], the world’s population may surpass 9.7 billion, reflecting a substantial demographic expansion over the intervening years. To address the long-term challenge posed by urbanization effectively, urban building energy modeling emerges as an imperative and requisite approach in academic research and urban planning endeavors. The fundamental purpose of urban building energy modeling is to simulate and analyze the intricate dynamics of energy consumption within urban environments. Compared to building energy modeling, UBEM simulates while considering building height, surface coverage, and spatial arrangement, probing their interactions and discerning their collective influence on energy dynamics at the urban scale. Swan and Ugursal [ 3] set a tone in reviewing urban modeling of the residential sector, subdividing the modeling methodologies into top-down and bottom-up approaches. Specifically, bottom-up physic-based UBEM methods have garnered attention in recent times [ 4]. Robinson et al. developed CitySim to assist urban settlements with sustainable planning and also simulate the energy use of a few buildings ranging from tens to thousands. Those UBEM methods are reasonably accurate in simulating the performance of almost any building combination systems [ 6]. However, customized urban projects, and optimization problems involving many UBEM evaluations, are time-consuming and labor-intensive, and based on the scalability, the simulation runtime can be exponentially high if a broad set of design variations is analyzed. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Overview of CityTFT. CitySim and CityTFT apply the same weather input while CityTFT uses simplified building parameters. Here, we propose a surrogate data-driven approach to accelerate the simulation process in UBEM. Compared to similar previous works [ 7–9], we based our work on the extensively used forecasting model, Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) [ 10]. We extract the static covariate encoder and variable selection network from the TFT structure while adding a small neural network to model the probability of triggering heating and cooling needs. The major improvements are: 1.) Sequential input has been applied in a transformer-based model to improve the temporal accuracy. 2.) A training strategy that models from weather dynamics and urban interactions to energy demands simultaneously with a customized loss function. 3.) Improved generalizability for the proposed surrogate model. Urban planners or Energy Sectors could benefit from urban-level energy demand estimations by the proposed approach to enhance the decision-making process. 2 Methods Data Prepration As a surrogate model, this work aims to duplicate the ability of physic-based UBEM models, CitySim [ 5], to simulate urban building energy. Two major inputs of UBEM are urban geometries and weather data. This study utilized the university campus geometries and the calibrated building parameters from [ 11] which contains 114 buildings in a wide variety. 13 variables are extracted from the building geometries to represent the static building covariates. The detailed transformation method can be found in the appendix. The other requirement of CitySim is weather information. This study collects 21 Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) files in different climate zones globally by Meteonorm [ 12] to obtain fruitful weather dynamics. 12 environmental variables are served in climate files as the temporal covariates while one additional variable, hour of year, is added to improve the temporal identification. Those variables are listed in Table 3. The ideal hourly heating and cooling demands are simulated through CitySim solver for each building which concludes a dataset with roughly 17 million samples. The sequence length in our training process is 24. All the building variables, weather data, and electricity loads have been normalized for preprocessing.
