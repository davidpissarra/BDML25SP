Our results demonstrate significant improvements in emission rate accuracy compared to previous methods [11]. By leveraging this enhanced approach, we can enable near real-time, precise quantification of major CO 2emission sources, supporting environmental protection initiatives and informing regulatory frameworks. 1 Introduction Over the past two decades, greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from burning fossil fuels by electricity industry has increased its carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions by 53% worldwide [13]. Experts expect that more than half of all future carbon emissions will come from this sector [15]. Understanding power plant emissions (\"super emitters\"), especially in regions where proper accounting mechanisms are lacking, is crucial for identifying sources and quantifying emissions to support carbon-neutrality pathways. Estimation of carbon emissions to the atmosphere has generally been performed using two complementary approaches: “bottom-up” and “top-down” methods [6]. Bottom-up methods aggregate source-specific CO 2flux estimates to form a total emission inventory based on activity data and emission models [8]. These inventories can be highly resolved in both space and time, but they are prone to systematic errors, and their uncertainties are not well known [1] and their time lags for more than years with respect to real time is another concern. Top-down methods infer quantitative information on surface CO 2fluxes from variations in atmospheric CO 2concentration observations through inverse modeling with atmospheric tracer transport models [16]. Recently, there has been an increase in atmospheric observations through satellite observations [3], driven by the growing number of dedicated satellites, advancements in sensor technology, and improved spatial resolution. This has heightened interest in using atmospheric observations to derive CO 2emissions. Traditional inverse modeling systems, often relying on Lagrangian Particle Dispersion Models (LPDMs), are a popular approach to quantify CO 2emission rates using atmospheric observations [7]. However, increased volume of atmospheric observations strained the computational capacity of these traditional methods along with challenges remain in the spatial allocation of emissions due to uncertainties in prior fluxes and atmospheric transport models. In recent years, efforts have been made to use data-driven learning approaches to detect plumes and their shapes, and then invert CO 2plumes from major emission sources. However, many studies rely on simulated data to learn the complex concentration-to-flux conversion, and there are very Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.few studies exploring similar techniques using observed data from satellites [11]. To enhance the current data-driven understanding, three main challenges must be addressed: (1) Observed data from satellites, such as carbon dioxide concentration (XCO 2) measurements, are often limited, with only 10% of the data being clean and temporally very sparse [12]. (2) The robustness and generalizability of data-driven approaches are limited when only simulated data are used, due to inconsistencies in emission distributions and the lack of data representing diverse power plant profiles. Additionally, CO2plumes are notoriously difficult to invert due to various factors such as missing data and signal- to-noise ratio (SNR) issues. (3) Super emitters, like power plants, do not report emissions in a timely manner or at a fine temporal frequency, which poses a labeling challenge for supervised learning models aimed at learning emission rates at finer temporal resolutions. In this work, we aim to address (a) the sparsity of satellite observation data by employing a machine learning approach, (b) create a novel dataset by merging simulated data with satellite observations, and finally (c) customize a U-Net model for learning CO 2concentration-to-flux conversion for power plant emission rates. 2 Model to Estimate Emission Rate We have employed two distinct deep learning architectures to estimate CO 2emission rates for power plants: the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and the U-Net regression model. Each architecture is tailored to capture spatial patterns and relationships within the input data, aiming to enhance the accuracy of emissions predictions. We briefly summarize these models below: Baseline Model - CNN: The CNN model as adapted from [11] uses a multi-layered architecture consisting of convolution layers that detect features, max-pooling for dimensionality reduction and retaining key features, batch normalization for training stability and dropout to prevent over-fitting. The final dense layer with Leaky ReLU activation produces the predictions. This model serves as the baseline for our performance evaluation.
