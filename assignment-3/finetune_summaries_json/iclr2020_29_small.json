The research questions we want to  address are: how have  the patenting activities changed over time in CCMT   patents? And who are the technological leaders? The investigation of these  questions can offer the technological landscape in climate change related  technologies at the international level. We propose a hybrid Latent Dirichlet   Allocation (LDA) approach for topic modelling and identification of relationships  between terms and topics related to CCMT, enabling better visualizations of  underlying intellectual property dynamics. Further, we propose predictive  modelling for CCTT and competitor analysis to identify and rank countries with  a similar patent landscape. The projected results are expected to facilitate the  transfer process associated  with existing and emerging climate change  technologies and improve technology cooperation between governments.   1 INTRODUCTION   The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines te chnology transfer (TT) as \"a  broad set of processes covering the flows of know -how, experience, and equipment for mitigating  and adapting to climate change among different stakeholders such as Governments, private sector  entities, financial institutions, n ongovernmental organizations (NGOs) and research/educational  institutions.\"(IPCC, 2000).  Schnepp et al. (1990) define technology transfer as ‘‘A process by which  expertise or knowledge related to some aspect of technology is passed from one user to anothe r for  the purpose of economic gain’’. In the case of the transfer of CCMT, the economic benefits  include   the reduction of the future costs associated with climate change and othe r benefits to the co untries   involved i n the transfer process.  Technology transfer is not only about the exchange of device or  know -how across national or international frontiers, but also about the complicated processes of  sharing knowledge and adapting technology to meet local scenarios.   1.1. NEED FOR CCTT   Agenda 21 that resulted from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development  recognizes that “there is a need for favourable access to and transfer of environmentally sound  technologies, in particular to devel oping countries, through supportive measures that promote  technology cooperation and that should enable transfer of necessary technological know -how as  well as building up of economic, technical, and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and  furthe r development of transferred technology” (United Nations, 1992). The Johannesburg Plan of  Implementation (JPOI) that resulted from the World Summit on Sustainable Development calls  upon governments and relevant regional and international organizations to t ake action on  development, dissemination and deployment of affordable cleaner energy, energy efficiency and  energy conservation technologies and the transfer of these technologies to developing countries  (DSD, 2015). Figure 1 highlights Intellectual proper ty landscape in the field of climate change  technologies. Drawing upon new extractions from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database  (PATSTAT), The International Energy Agency (IEA) and Organisation for Economic Co -operation   2 and Development  (OECD) have f ound that while patenting of innovations in climate change  mitigation technologies (CCMT) related to power generation, transport, buildings, manufacturing,  and carbon capture and storage (CCS) had generally been increasing much faster than other  technologi es in the period up to 2011 -2012 (IEA, 2019).

The rate of global patenting on the climate chan ge mitigation technologies is  essential for dissemination of knowledge globally.  For analysing  climate change  patents transfer  data we propose a step by step methodology as represented in Figure 2.

Investigating these questions can provide insights into the technological landscape of climate change-related technologies at the international level.\n\nWe propose a hybrid Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) approach for topic modeling and identification of relationships between terms and topics related to CCMT, enabling better visualizations of underlying intellectual property dynamics. Additionally, we propose predictive modeling for CCMT and competitor analysis to identify and rank countries with a similar patent landscape. The projected results are expected to facilitate the transfer process associated with existing and emerging climate change technologies and improve technology cooperation between governments.\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) defines technology transfer (TT) as \"a broad set of processes covering the flows of know-how, experience, and equipment for mitigating and adapting to climate change among different stakeholders\" (IPCC, 2000). Schnepp et al. (1990) define technology transfer as \"a process by which expertise or knowledge related to some aspect of technology is passed from one user to another for the purpose of economic gain.\" In the context of CCMT, the economic benefits include the reduction of future costs associated with climate change and other benefits to the countries involved in the transfer process.\n\nTechnology transfer is not only about the exchange of devices or know-how across national or international frontiers but also about the complex processes of sharing knowledge and adapting technology to meet local scenarios.\n\n**1.1. Need for Climate Change Technology Transfer (CCTT)**\n\nAgenda 21, resulting from the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, recognizes the need for favorable access to and transfer of environmentally sound technologies, particularly to developing countries, through supportive measures that promote technology cooperation and enable the transfer of necessary technological know-how and the building up of economic, technical, and managerial capabilities for the efficient use and further development of transferred technology (United Nations, 1992). The Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPOI) calls upon governments and relevant regional and international organizations to take action on the development, dissemination, and deployment of affordable cleaner energy, energy efficiency, and energy conservation technologies and the transfer of these technologies to developing countries (DSD, 2015).\n\nFigure 1 highlights the intellectual property landscape in the field of climate change technologies. Drawing upon new extractions from the Worldwide Patent Statistical Database (PATSTAT), the International Energy Agency (IEA), and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) have found that patenting of innovations in climate change mitigation technologies (CCMT) related to power generation, transport, buildings, manufacturing, and carbon capture and storage (CCS) had generally been increasing much faster than other technologies in the period up to 2011-2012 (IEA, 2019). However, there has been a notable drop-off in the number of these patents since 2015, as represented by Figure 1.\n\n**Figure 1: Global patent applications for climate change mitigation technologies**\n\n**2. Methodology**\n\nStudies indicate that most technology transfer takes place among developed countries (Stewart, 1992). The rate of global patenting on climate change mitigation technologies is essential for the dissemination of knowledge globally. For analyzing climate change patents transfer data, we propose a step-by-step methodology, as represented in Figure 2.\n\n**2.1. Step 1: Data Collection**\n\nThe patent documents related to climate change technologies will be collected from the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO)'s online database. The data source is appropriate for exploring technological trends because it is a representative patent database containing an enormous number of patents from all over the world and covers the most advanced technologies (Kim & Lee, 2015).
