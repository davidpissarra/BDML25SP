Here we propose a novel, scalable, nonstationary GP model based upon discrete wavelets, and evaluate them on toy and real world data. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change poses a major challenge in which probabilistic modelling has a lot to offer. The governing physical equations are well-studied, giving a powerful source of prior knowledge, but are typically nonlinear and often chaotic, so that uncertainty in initial conditions, boundary values, or parameters compound rapidly and limit the capability to generalise over both space and time, particularly for resolving on small spatial scales or forecasting. Incorporating data-based modelling methods, the core of modern machine learning techniques, is critical to correct for these mismatches in either model or initialisation. Reasoning quantitatively about uncertainty is crucial, both for weighting data against prior physical knowledge, and for feeding into downstream applications, for example to optimise sensor place- ment, or make risk-aware forecasts of renewable energy generation. These methodologies are even more important in regions where measurements are relatively scarce (such as remote mountainous regions), or systems are particularly sensitive to seasonal or climatic variations (such as river systems predominantly fed by glacial melt). Research in recent years on improving the performance of machine learning models, enhancing their performance at scale, and incorporating prior (physical) knowledge into their training and predictions has been both intensive and fruitful. In particular, spatial or spatiotemperal modelling methods have made rapid recent progress, and there are many performant methods readily available to use, and interest in applying these methods to real-world problems has been growing (Prudden et al., 2021; Lalchand et al., 2022; Ekanayaka et al., 2022; Gahungu et al., 2022; Cuomo et al., 2022; Berlinghieri et al., 2023; Jiang et al., 2024). Gaussian processes offer a particularly compelling tool for probabilistic regression, with a long history of use in geospatial modelling (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006). Recent work on improving the speed of learning in the conjugate setting (Gaussian measurement noise) has shown considerable potential for scaling up in the low dimensional, geospatial setting (Hensman et al., 2017; Dutordoir et al., 2020; Cunningham et al., 2023; Cheema & Rasmussen, 2023; Wu et al., 2022; Tran et al., 2021; Wilson & Nickisch, 2015). However, often these methods require the Gaussian process’s covariance function to be stationary– that is, invariant to translations. However, many climatic phenomena are highly nonstationary, and 1Figure 1: Comparing predictions on 1D toy data. No training data is used within the black lines. suitable nonstationary covariance functions have not been well-studied (Lalchand et al., 2022; Prud- den et al., 2021). When stationary models are applied to highly non-stationary data, they tend to fail in one of two ways. Either they fit the low frequency trends, and ignore the high frequency parts (Figure 1), or they learn globally low lengthscales to fit the high frequency part, and suffer from rapid reversion to the prior in regions of missing data (Figure 2). Both failure modes lead to problematic poor predictions. High performing non-stationary GP models exist, but are computationally expensive to train. In this work we propose a GP prior with independent wavelet components. This provides a non- stationary prior, which also has the noteworthy property that fine-scaled behaviour is independent of coarse-scaled behaviour, common in climatic systems (Prudden et al., 2021). Additionally, we provide an efficient learning algorithm comparable to those for stationary covariance functions. The performance approaches that of state of the art non-stationary GPs, but with far better scalability. 2 G AUSSIAN PROCESS REGRESSION The conjugate setting for GP regression is the generative model yn=f(xn) +σρnn∈ {1 :N}f∼ GP (0, k) (1) where k:RD×RD→Ris a (positive definite, symmetric) covariance function or kernel, yn, ρn∈ R, σ∈R≥0,x∈RD, and each ρnhas an independent standard normal distribution. 2The posterior p(f|x1:N, y1:N)and marginal likelihood p(y1:N)are Gaussian and available in closed form (Rasmussen & Williams, 2006).
