While genetic methods typically only target one particular aspect of plant development, a combination of ecological factors can inﬂuence development as a whole. While both approaches are complementary, we focus on the latter. Suc- cessful and sustainable ways of improving yield under lim- ited environmental resources will impact agriculture, and thus humanity, on a global scale. As an example scenario, consider the case of a prolonged regional drought, where irrigation becomes necessary to keep the land arable. The amount of water that can be sup- plied might be limited, and a ﬁxed amount might need to be smartly distributed over the full life cycle of an organism. Similarly, the amount of fertilizer applied throughout the life cycle of a plant should be kept to a minimum to protect the environment. It is not clear, however, what the best timing for application would be: Is it best to apply a high con- centration at germination, should small amounts be applied continuously, or should application rates increase with ma- turity of the plant? While best-practice knowledge naturally exists among farmers, it is not clear how or whether speciﬁc protocols transfer well to new scenarios, such as droughts, extreme temperature or precipitation, shifted seasons, etc. In general, it is not clear whether speciﬁc protocols are optimal in that they provide the best possible conditions for a plant, or whether more sophisticated application schedules could lead to better results. Moreover, in modern agriculture, any treatment is typically applied to the whole ﬁeld, based on some average assessment. However, it is likely that different parts of a population, or even individual organisms, would beneﬁt from individualized treatment, such as provision of speciﬁc nutrients, based on their actual individual condition, rather than the average state of the culture.

Deep Learning methods deliver better-than-human performance in various tasks, such as image analysis, game-playing, and control (LeCun et al., 2015; Mnih et al., 2015). It is to be expected that similarly, in agriculture, such methods can be used as decision support systems and smart controllers, which rival human performance.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nCertain parameters, such as yield and environmental impact, can be optimized in an automated way. Specifically, we propose using reinforcement learning to autonomously explore and learn ways of influencing the development of certain types of plants, controlling environmental parameters, such as irrigation or nutrient supply, and receiving sensory feedback, such as camera images, humidity, and moisture measurements. The trained system will be able to provide instructions for optimal treatment of a local population of plants, based on non-invasive measurements, such as imaging.\n\nUnlike genetic methods for plant development optimization, which typically target one or at most a few aspects of the development process, machine learning methods can take into account a large number of high-dimensional variables. We expect both greenhouse and outdoor production environments to benefit considerably from such fine-grained control systems. In particular, a learned model may be used to achieve yield maximization under challenging environmental conditions, such as limited space, extreme temperature, or water supply limitations.\n\nThe upcoming agricultural challenges demand innovation both at the genetic level (determining crop productivity and robustness to environmental stress) and the ecological level (determining conditions that lead to optimal plant development).

We focus on the latter.\n\nSuccessful and sustainable ways of improving yield under limited environmental resources will impact agriculture and humanity on a global scale. For example, consider a prolonged regional drought where irrigation becomes necessary to keep the land arable. The amount of water that can be supplied might be limited, and a fixed amount might need to be smartly distributed over the full life cycle of an organism. Similarly, the amount of fertilizer applied throughout the life cycle of a plant should be kept to a minimum to protect the environment.\n\nIt is unclear what the best timing for application would be: whether to apply a high concentration at germination, apply small amounts continuously, or increase application rates with the maturity of the plant. Best-practice knowledge exists among farmers, but it is unclear how or whether specific protocols transfer well to new scenarios, such as droughts, extreme temperatures, or shifted seasons.
