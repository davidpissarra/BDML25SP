This can signiﬁcantly reduce the number of iterations to converge to optimality. 1. Introduction Optimization methods are increasingly being used for plan- ning and operations of complex systems such as electricity grids. A central part of daily planning and operations of elec- tricity grid operators (Tong, 2004) is to dispatch generation in order to meet demand at minimum cost, while respecting reliability and security constraints. This is done by solving a constrained optimization problem, often referred to as Optimal Power Flow (OPF). The OPF problem is in general challenging because, 1) it is a non-convex and non-linear constrained optimization problem that can also be mixed integer in its full form, and 2) it is computationally expen- sive due to the large size of power grids and high number of constraints. In order to reduce the time complexity of the OPF problem the general practice is to use an approximate form that is convex and has a reduced number of variables and constraints. However, the solution to this simpliﬁed problem is known to be far from the optimal one and can lead to inefﬁciencies in grid operations (Ilic et al., 2006). According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (epa, 2019), electricity production contributed to 27.5% of the total U.S. greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2017 placing this sector in the second place among GHG producers. With increasing concerns over climate change, multiple studies have suggested that reducing overall emis- sions from generation should be taken into account in OPF 1Invenia Labs, Cambridge, UK 2University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK(Gholami et al., 2014), which makes the problem more com- plex. Further, the integration of renewable energy sources such as wind and solar add other complications to OPF due to the volatility of these resources. To deal with this volatil- ity, OPF should be solved as near to real-time as possible, which would require improvements to OPF convergence times and robustness. 2. Proposed Methodology Non-linear and non-convex constrained optimization prob- lems can be solved by interior-point methods such as IPopt (W¨achter & Biegler, 2006). They can take as input a given initialization (called warm-start). A good initialization is important for two reasons: 1) it can help avoid poor local minima and reach the global minimum, and 2) it can speed up convergence to this global minimum. We propose an algorithm that outputs the initialization for interior-point solvers, through meta-optimization. This algorithm can be trained by using a loss metric as the number of iterations needed to solve the problem. This approach is inspired by recent work in the meta-learning literature, including (Ravi & Larochelle, 2017) and (Finn, 2017). Our model is trained not to optimize a single instance of an OPF problem, but a family of them. It takes as input a formulation of the problem, and outputs an initialization. Advantages of this method include: 1) leveraging already well-established constrained optimization solvers, and 2) getting guaranteed solutions to the true problem.
