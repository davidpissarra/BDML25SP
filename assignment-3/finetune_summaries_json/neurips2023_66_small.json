Yet, significant gaps exist in the literature regarding the influence of changes in environmental conditions on disease spread over time and across different regions and climates making it chal- lenging to obtain reliable forecasts. This paper aims to propose an approach to pre- dict malaria incidence over time and space by employing a multi-dimensional long short-term memory model (M-LSTM) to simultaneously analyse environmental in- dicators such as vegetation, temperature, night-time lights, urban/rural settings, and precipitation. We developed and validated a spatio-temporal data fusion approach to predict district-level malaria incidence rates for the year 2017 using spatio-temporal data from 2000 to2016 across three South Asian countries: Pakistan, India, and Bangladesh. In terms of predictive performance the proposed M-LSTM model results in lower country-specific error rates compared to existing spatio-temporal deep learning models. The data and code have been made publicly available at the study GitHub repository: https://github.com/usmanweb/CITY-at-LUMS. 1 Climate Impact Statement Climate change has been linked with acceleration and aggravation of the spread of infectious diseases; consequently worsening the risk to human health. Pathogens responsible for diseases such as malaria, cholera, Zika virus and others are known to spread more easily amidst extreme environmental changes such as heatwaves, floods, droughts, and wildfires caused by globally rising temperatures. Moreover, the spread of infectious diseases varies geographically, and this variability is connected to changes in the local environment. In the context of the South Asia use-case presented in this study, malaria incidence was predicted for each district in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh for the year 2017 using geo-spatio-temporal data from 2000 to2016. The proposed approach integrates environmental factors and historical malaria data, offering the ability to make localised temporal predictions. This fusion of spatial and historical information, generalisable to other infectious diseases affected by the environment, has the potential to contribute significantly to country and regional level malaria early warning systems, providing valuable insights for proactive and targeted interventions against a rapidly changing climate. 2 Introduction Malaria remains one of the leading communicable causes of death Gelband et al. (2020); Cowman et al. (2016). Approximately half of the worldâ€™s population is considered at risk, predominantly in 37th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2023), Louisiana, United States.African and South Asian countries Rosenthal et al. (2019). Although malaria is preventable, spatio- temporal heterogeneity in climatological, sociodemographic, and environmental risk factors make outbreak prediction challenging. Data-driven approaches accounting for spatio-temporal variability may offer potential for region-specific malaria predicting tools. Production of accurate models is complicated on two fronts. Firstly, tracking malaria incidence can present challenges, particularly in resource-limited settings. Often, these measurements are extrapolated from household surveys that are small in scale and expensive, and therefore prone to mis-estimation. Secondly, while environmental factors have been found to play a role in influencing the life cycle of the malarial parasite Gaudart et al. (2009), the fluctuation of outbreak patterns across different regions and time periods, and their dependence on multi-dimensional factors, make modelling these impacts complex. Various methodologies have been developed to address this challenge in a data-driven manner. Machine learning and deep learning techniques have gained prominence in recent years for their ability to analyze complex spatio-temporal data. For instance, the use of classification techniques such as KNN, Naive Bayes, and Extreme Gradient Boost have proven effective in examining the relationship between historical meteorological data and records of malarial cases Kalipe et al. (2018). Additionally, the integration of spatio-temporal earth observation measurements, e.g. sea surface temperature variability, has shown promise in machine learning approaches for predicting malaria outbreaks Martineau et al. (2022). We propose a deep learning method (M-LSTM) to analyze historical environmental data with the aim to provide insight into how the combination of such factors can contribute to the development of early warning systems. 2.1 Contributions We derived a bespoke dataset on environmental indicators such as nighttime lights directly from satellite imagery. We then linked this bespoke dataset with publicly available environmental indi- cators datasets and malaria incidence datasets. Subsequently, we implemented a meticulous data segmentation process, dividing the data based on both spatial locations and time, providing precise and localized insights. This enabled us to leverage a comprehensive set of 43features for each spatial location for each year included in the study. Together, these contributions resulted in improved predictive performance as well as a detailed dataset for the use of the wider research community.
