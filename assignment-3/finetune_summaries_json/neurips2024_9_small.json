A challenge to increasing regenerative agriculture practices is cheaply measuring SOC over time and understanding how SOC is affected by regenerative agricultural practices and other environmental factors and farm management prac- tices. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-driven Soil Organic Carbon Copilot that automates the ingestion of complex multi-resolution, multi-modal data to provide large-scale insights into soil health and regenerative practices. Our data includes extreme weather event data (e.g., drought and wildfire incidents), farm management data (e.g., cropland information and tillage predictions), and SOC predictions. We find that integrating public data and specialized models enables large-scale, localized analysis for sustainable agriculture. In comparisons of agricultural practices across California counties, we find evidence that diverse agricultural activity may mitigate the negative effects of tillage; and that while extreme weather conditions heavily affect SOC, composting may mitigate SOC loss. Finally, implementing role-specific personas empowers agronomists, farm consultants, policymakers, and other stakeholders to implement evidence-based strategies that promote sustainable agriculture and build climate resilience. 1 Introduction The agricultural sector faces the simultaneous challenges of addressing climate change and feeding a growing population. As a result, we must concurrently enhance agricultural productivity, minimize environmental impact, and adapt agriculture to be resilient to a changing climate Walke et al. (2022). Previous research demonstrates the potential of regenerative agricultural practices for higher, more nutritious yields, improved soil health, and carbon sequestration capabilities Lal (2004). Though soil Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.is a complex living medium, we can leverage remote sensing and machine learning to predict SOC, a proxy measurement for soil health Sharma et al. (2023a,b). Soil science research has demonstrated while regenerative practices, including composting and cover cropping, may improve soil, several other external factors, like extreme weather conditions, may lead to SOC loss. With the many factors influencing soil health, there is the opportunity to utilize AI-driven data insights to inform sustainable agriculture decisions. Data-driven insights not only have the potential to help farmers directly but also to inform policymakers who develop grants to help fund regenerative agriculture. For example, the California Department of Food and Agriculture has a Healthy Soils Program to fund farms to implement regenerative agriculture practices. It is important to note that there is skepticism about fair access to and effectiveness of funding, among other concerns Barbato, C.T., Strong, A.L. (2023). Despite the opportunity of adopting AI for regenerative agriculture, some barriers include speed, scalability, and accessibility. Further, the agriculture industry encompasses a range of stakeholders, including smallholder farmers, large corporations, agronomists, consultants, and policymakers, each with distinct needs and priorities. Stakeholder diversity poses challenges in developing universally effective and flexible solutions. Related work has shown that large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address the challenges mentioned previously, as well as reach various stakeholders A et al. (2023); Kuska et al. (2024); Tzachor et al. (2023). In this paper, we present a SOC copilot, an AI soil analyst, that enables large-scale analysis of the effects of extreme weather events and land management practices on soil health for a range of agricultural stakeholders to support agriculture and environmental decision-making. 1.1 Contributions Our AI-enabled SOC Copilot makes significant advancements in data-driven agriculture by enabling serveral new use cases through large-scale data analysis. The copilot automates the complex process of ingesting comprehensive multi-resolution, multi-modal data from public sources, complemented by specialized machine learning models. Our contributions include: Enhanced Large-scale Data Accessibility Aggregating and enhancing existing datasets with AI-driven insights enables large-scale soil health analysis. This capability is crucial for advancing regenerative agricultural practices and understanding their impact on SOC. We demonstrate the capabilities of the copilot by generating SOC prediction data for the state of California, USA, for the years 2016 and 2023. Tillage Detection at Scale Tillage plays a vital role in influencing changes in SOC. However, obtaining this data is often challenging. We conduct extensive pixel-based tillage detection across California with Coherent Change Detection (CCD) Preiss and Stacy (2006). To our knowledge, this is the first study to undertake large-scale tillage detection. Personalized Stakeholder Engagement We provide tailored personas within the SOC Copilot, enabling customized, data-driven advice for various agricultural stakeholders. This personalized approach ensures that the tool meets the needs of different users, enhancing its utility and effectiveness. 1.2 Opportunity for Impact The SOC Copilot leverages LLMs to address critical challenges in regenerative agriculture and climate resilience, offering tangible benefits for agricultural practice and policy development. Improved Accessibility and Social Equity The SOC Copilot may improve accessibility for diverse stakeholders, including those from economically disadvantaged communities. By offering flexible model configurations, the copilot provides an financially viable solution for farmers from vulnerable communities, such as small\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
