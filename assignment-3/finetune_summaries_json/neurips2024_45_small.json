To bridge this gap, we propose a novel method that combines the strengths of both approaches by estimating the water use and the crop sensitivity to water scarcity at the pixel level. This approach enables yield loss estimation grounded in physical principles by sequentially solving the equation for crop yield response to water scarcity, using an enhanced loss function.

Additionally, it provides interpretable and physical consistent outputs, supporting industry, policymakers, and farmers in adapting to extreme weather conditions. 1 Introduction RNN PB RNN RNN PI-RNN PB PB (a) Physics-Informed Model 0 10 20 30 400 10 20 30 40 50 60ground truth (0.37 %) 0 10 20 30 400 10 20 30 40 50 60prediction (0.43 %) 0.0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 target (%)0.00.10.20.30.40.50.60.7prediction (%)prediction over target (subfield, pixels) 0 10 20 30 400 10 20 30 40 50 60relative error (clipped) 0 10 20 30 400 10 20 30 40 50 60relative error (full range) histogram prediction and target prediction target 0.20.30.40.50.60.7 yield (%) 0.20.30.40.50.60.7 yield (%) 100 75 50 25 0255075100 relative yield error (%) 41.5 0.0243.9 relative yield error (%) (b) Prediction, target and yield loss distribution. Figure 1: (a) Framework for physics-informed yield loss forecasting. Data modalities, including Sentinel-2 imagery and climate variables, are used to train an RNN that predicts biophysical properties for each time point (actual water use ( ETa), and the crop susceptibility to water scarcity ( Ky)). A simulation model predicts the maximum water use ( ETx). The predicted biophysical properties are used to calculate the actual yield loss ( Yl). We leverage prior knowledge describing the relationship between water use and the relative yield loss. (b) Performance plots for visual inspection of a single field.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.In response to climate change, closing the gap between potential and actual yields is an urgent task to sustain food security [ 7]. Extreme weather conditions like droughts and floodings are pressing challenges in the agricultural sector, directly affecting productivity, and causing yield losses [ 2,15]. Digital agriculture has emerged as a key strategy to address these challenges, providing tools for timely, informed decision-making by policymakers, industry stakeholders, and farmers [ 19]. The response of crop yields to water availability has been a central focus of research for decades, serving as a critical parameter in assessing crop resilience under extreme climate conditions [ 17]. Traditionally, simulation models, also known as process-based models, have been employed to capture this relationship. These models build upon biological and physical principles to offer high explainability, supporting decisions in areas such as irrigation, fertilization, pest management, and disease control. However, crop simulation models often struggle with high-resolution, multidimensional data, are computationally intensive, and require calibration, rendering their applicability to high spatial resolution (pixel-level) unfeasible. Furthermore, they are often simplified representations of reality, relying on approximations to maintain computational efficiency [ 12], oftentimes resulting in inaccurate performances [ 13]. Therefore, machine learning (ML) models are increasingly utilized for crop productivity estimation [21]. Recent studies demonstrate impressive scalability and accuracy, even at pixel resolution [9,16], by handling complex and multidimensional data [ 14]. However, ML models are often criticized for their black-box characteristics, limiting their interpretability [ 4]. Additionally, ML are seldomly designed to follow underlying physical principles of plant growth [ 8], thereby hardly ever providing meaningful intermediate outputs, which are essential for tracking crop responses to changing environmental conditions over time. There is a growing demand to integrate the strengths of data-driven ML approaches with the interpretability of simulation models [ 5,12].
