Introduction Aerosols are atmospheric particles that inﬂuence the Earth’s energy budget both by scattering radiation directly (direct ef- fect) [ 8], and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that modulate cloud droplet number and radiative proper- ties (indirect effect). Aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) con- tribute the largest uncertainty to the projection of anthro- pogenic climate change, in part due to the poor estimates of the abundance and vertical distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere [4]. While ﬁeld measurement campaigns provide detailed aerosol data, these are spatio-temporally sparse [1, 13] and provide insufﬁcient constraints on aerosol global distribu- tion. In contrast, satellite observations offer long term global records, but they are typically limited to measurements of aerosol optical properties [12].

We propose initial solutions for the aggregate output regression problem and demonstrate their potential on climate model data.\n\n1. Introduction\n\nAerosols are atmospheric particles that influence the Earth's energy budget by scattering radiation directly and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei that modulate cloud droplet number and radiative properties. Aerosol-cloud interactions contribute the largest uncertainty to the projection of anthropogenic climate change, partly due to poor estimates of aerosol abundance and vertical distribution in the atmosphere. Field measurement campaigns provide detailed aerosol data, but these are spatio-temporally sparse and provide insufficient constraints on aerosol global distribution. In contrast, satellite observations offer long-term global records, but they are typically limited to measurements of aerosol optical properties.\n\nA widespread proxy for aerosol concentration or cloud condensation nuclei is Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), defined at a given wavelength as:\n\nAOD(λ) = ∫bext(λ, h) dh\n\nwhere bext is the extinction coefficient and the integral is taken over the height of the atmospheric column. While AOD is useful as a measure of total aerosol load within the column, it does not provide information on the vertical distribution of aerosols, which strongly influences both the magnitudes and even the sign of the aerosol direct and indirect effects.\n\nFor example, both modeling and observational studies find AOD to be inadequate for assessing aerosol-cloud interactions over vast subtropical ocean areas, which play a key role in determining the radiation balance of the Earth. However, vertically resolved aerosol extinction coefficient bext shows significantly higher correlations with cloud condensation nuclei or its proxies.\n\nWe investigate the reconstruction of aerosol vertical profiles using meteorology and chemistry covariates as inputs.
