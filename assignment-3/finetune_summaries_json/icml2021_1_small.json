Large-scale ship-track data are at the nexus of environmental policy, cli- mate physics, and maritime shipping industry: they can be used to study aerosol-cloud interac- tions, the largest uncertainty source in climate forcing; to evaluate compliance and impacts of environmental policies; and to study the impact of signiﬁcant socioeconomic events on maritime shipping.

Introduction Ship tracks appear as semi-linear features and were ﬁrst identiﬁed as “anomalous cloud lines” in satellite images (Conover, 1966). They are frequently found within stra- tus /stratocumulus cloud ﬁelds that are capped by moder- ate to strong temperature and humidity inversions (Figure 1). Ship-tracks are produced by aerosols affecting cloud physics: particles formed from ship exhaust increase droplet concentration in clouds, resulting in smaller but more nu- merous cloud droplets, and increase total reﬂected sunlight. This effect is particularly evident for spectral bands in the shortwave and midwave infared spectral regions, such as 2.1 and 3.7 µm bands (Platnick, 2003). Ship tracks are also used to study the response of total cloud liquid water to aerosols. Both effects, more numerous droplets and more cloud liquid water, can lead to more reﬂected solar radiation back to space, producing a cooling effect on the climate. Figure 1. An example of a MODIS scene with multiple ship-tracks visible. It is in the Northern Paciﬁc south of Alaska. In this example, ship-tracks are easily noted in the visible wavelength, which is not the case in general. This is for illustration purpose. This cooling effect, known as aerosol indirect forcing, is a key climate driver. The aerosol indirect forcing is a re-Nexus of Environmental Policy, Climate Physics, and Maritime Shipping sult of anthropogenic pollution in general affecting cloud properties and changing reﬂected solar radiation. It remains the most uncertain component of human-induced radiative forcing to the climate and predicted future warming depends sensitively on its magnitude (Stocker & et al., 2013). Ship tracks provide ideal settings to study aerosol indirect ef- fects because of the clear separation between dynamics and aerosol effects and between control and perturbed clouds. Cloud responses to aerosols from ship exhaust provide im- portant observational constraints for estimating aerosol indi- rect forcing. Manual segmentation of ship-tracks is expensive and the amount of data to process is large. A consequence is limited ship-track samples for analysis while the aerosol indirect effects depend sensitively on background conditions, which requires large samples. For example, it has been 55 years since the discovery of ship-tracks and no global maps of ship-tracks have been produced. Research progress is thus slowed. Here we develop ensemble deep segmentation models to de- tect ship-tracks automatically and demonstrate a connection among environmental policy, climate physics and maritime shipping activity through ship-tracks. In section 2, we dis- cuss the data and method used to detect ship-tracks as well as data for validation, environmental policy and maritime shipping. In section 3, we present insights from analyzing large amount of data. We conclude in section 4. 2. Data and Model 2.1.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nIn the past, research progress has been limited by the lack of a global map of ship-tracks. Here, we present the first global map of ship-tracks produced by applying deep segmentation models to large satellite data. Our model generalizes well and is validated against independent data. Large-scale ship-track data are at the intersection of environmental policy, climate physics, and maritime shipping industry. They can be used to study aerosol-cloud interactions, the largest uncertainty source in climate forcing; to evaluate compliance and impacts of environmental policies; and to study the impact of significant socioeconomic events on maritime shipping.\n\nBased on twenty years of global data, we show that cloud physics responses in ship-tracks strongly depend on the cloud regime.

The 2.1 µm reflectance data are the input for the segmentation model because they are most sensitive to perturbations in cloud droplet sizes due to ship exhaust and are not affected by other factors.\n\nShip tracks appear as semi-linear features and were first identified as \"anomalous cloud lines\" in satellite images (Conover, 1966).
