To do so successfully in resource-constrained low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), increasing operational efficiency is key. Such efficiency demands evolving knowledge of the grid’s state, of which topology—how points on the network are physically connected—is fundamental. In LMICs, knowledge of distribution topology is limited and established methods for topology estimation rely on expensive sensing infrastructure, such as smart meters or PMUs, that are inaccessible at scale. This paper lays the foundation for topology estimation from more accessible data: outlet-level voltage magnitude measurements. It presents a graph-based algorithm and explanatory visualization using the Fielder vector for estimating and communicating topological proximity from this data. We demonstrate the method on a real dataset collected in Ac- cra, Ghana, thus opening the possibility of globally accessible, cutting-edge grid monitoring through non-traditional sensing strategies coupled with ML. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change mitigation is a twin challenge: decarbonizing energy production and globally meet- ing energy needs. Electric grids play a central role in addressing this challenge, and must adapt to deliver electricity between new generation technologies and increasing consumer demand. Es- pecially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)—where per capita energy consumption is expected to grow dramatically despite far less investment in grid infrastructure—this growth will require new levels of efficiency and responsiveness in grid operations. This new operating approach should maximize the longevity of existing infrastructure and precisely target costly upgrades. Figure 1: The proposed algorithm reconstructs grid topology using voltage measurements from sen- sors placed on the edge of the network, and produces a Fiedler vector-based heatmap visualization. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Efficient operation of an electrical grid requires evolving knowledge of the grid’s state, of which topology—how points on the network are physically connected, including on which of three phases—is a key piece. Knowledge of grid topology can enable loss reduction by identifying con- nections for phase re-balancing, locating lossy equipment, and targeting load re-distribution to pro- long equipment life. Topological awareness can help localize the root causes of outages for quicker restoration and reduced use of polluting backup generation. Unfortunately knowledge of distribution grid topology is often poor or erroneous, especially in urban areas of LMICs. Existing solutions for topology estimation demand advanced sensing, such as smart meters or PMUs (Yuan et al. (2022); Cavraro & Kekatos (2018); Yu et al. (2017)); such devices are expensive to purchase, install, and operate and therefore largely absent from LMIC distribution networks. This work demonstrates topology estimation in LMICs by lowering the necessary sensing requirements. By proposing a modification of the transformation in Bariya et al. (2021) and a new visualization, we uncover rich topological information about the proximity of grid nodes from lower-cost, less- precise voltage magnitude sensors at the network edge (Klugman et al. (2021)). To our knowledge, this work presents the first real-world demonstration of topology estimation in the distribution grids of a LMICs from such an accessible data source. We present an initial evaluation of the proposed method in three selected case studies. The latter case studies expand upon our base method by adding creative sensor deployment strategies and fusing auxiliary data types from the same sensor, including event-triggered point-on-wave snapshots. These case studies lay a promising foundation for topology estimation from low-cost sensor deployments that are designed for the constraints of LMIC grids. 2 D EPLOYMENT AND DATA Our topology estimation method is validated on a dataset from 1,276 PowerWatch sensors deployed in Accra, Ghana. The PowerWatch sensors cost <1 % of commercially available PMU sensors that are traditionally used in topology estimation, and have been deployed at scale to monitor grid reliability in LMIC contexts (Klugman et al. (2021)). PowerWatch sensors plug into customer wall outlets and report voltage magnitude, frequency, and power state every two minutes. Due to limited GPS availability indoors, data is only provided with second-level timestamps, which precludes the use of topology algorithms that require precise time-synchronization across sensors. The sensors are deployed in groups of generally 3 but up to 20 sensors called “sites” to monitor a single transformer. As several hundred customers can be served by a transformer, this is an enormous but necessary undersampling, reflecting a reality for topology estimation in LMICs: comprehensive sensing of the distribution network is essentially impossible. We present four case studies in Accra: two at densely deployed sites—named 59and78—with 15 and 20 sensors respectively, a third at many sites spread along Aburi Road, and a fourth at two sites around Darkuman Road. In the latter case studies, voltage magnitude data is compared with two other data types—outage data and point-on-wave (POW)—to demonstrate the value of data fusion for topology recovery.
