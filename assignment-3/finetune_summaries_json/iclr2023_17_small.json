In this paper, we propose an automatic mobile computer vision method to estimate the DBH of a tree using a single depth map on a smartphone, along with our created dataset DepthMapDBH2023. We successfully demonstrated that this dataset paired with a lightweight regression convolutional neural network is able to accurately estimate the DBH of trees dis- tinct in appearance, shape, number of tree forks, tree density and crowding, and vine presence. Automation of these measurements will help crews in the field who are collecting data for forest inventories. Gathering as much on-the-ground data as possible is required to ensure the transparency of carbon credit projects. Access to high-quality datasets of manual measurements helps improve biomass models which are widely used in the field of ecological simulation. The code used in this paper is publicly available on Github and the dataset on Kaggle. 1 I NTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATION Creating forest inventories is a key component of carbon accounting as it is used to estimate forestry indices like forest growing stock, basal area, biomass, and carbon stock. The tree diameter at breast height is one of the variables used in allometric models [1, 2, 3, 4] to estimate tree carbon seques- tration. In a typical ground forest inventory survey, a field worker must wrap a measuring tape [5] around a tree trunk to measure the diameter of a tree at ”breast height” (1.3 meters). A measuring tape can be difficult to use in the field depending on diverse ecological and environmental factors [6]. Furthermore, measuring the DBH of trees with tape may require two people for larger trees, and is time intensive, making the work cost prohibitive. In this paper, we propose an automatic approach to estimate the DBH of a tree using a single depth map. This process can be easily integrated into a mobile application that saves field crews hours when creating forest inventories. It will also allow them to cover more surface and collect more data to optimize the carbon simulation/prediction models. 2 R ELATED WORK Researchers have been working on estimating DBH using LiDAR remote sensing data [7] or using mobile LiDAR scanning systems [8]. Some research has been done on the use of smartphone camera images to calculate dense point clouds for the estimation of a tree’s DBH [9, 10]. Similar research to our own, estimation of tree DBH with the use of depth information from consumer mobile devices, has been conducted. However, this research requires multiple steps as it involves the extraction of depth maps from RGB images of the trees using a depth extraction model before calculating the DBH [11]. 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2023 The novel solution we propose here, which includes the combination of a light deep learning ap- proach and a single depth map, can be used for ground data collection and is meant to be used directly and easily on a smartphone. This single-pass neural network model provides a more acces- sible solution for forest inventory crews when integrated into a smartphone application. Convolutional neural networks [12] have been used for regression tasks to estimate dimensions [13] successfully which encouraged our efforts to pursue this work. 3 D ATASET In this section, we will present the dataset DepthMapDBH2023 that we have created for this project. We will explain the data collection process, data features, and challenges encountered while collect- ing the dataset. The dataset is currently available on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ datasets/earthshot/depthmapdbh2023. 3.1 D ATA COLLECTION We have gathered 1008 trees’ RGB pictures along with their corresponding 192x192x1 depth maps and tape-measured DBH values. Figure 1: Dataset structure We designed a separate test set (164 samples) with different physical trees of diameters ranging from 0 cm to 109 cm. Figure 2: Plots of the distribution of the dataset (a) Dataset (b) Separate Test set We focused our data gathering on collecting DBH values between 0 and 120 cm in a relatively even distribution. Our final DBH value distribution for the datasets is illustrated in Figure 2. 2Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2023 3.2 C HALLENGES In order to generate the depth maps required for our research, we created a special iOS application for LiDAR iPhones. The application captured the necessary information needed for building this dataset. The values in the depth maps collected are in meters (float) but a conversion to decimeters was advantageous to distribute the values more evenly in the 0-255 float space. Our goal to create a robust model that was effective in a wide range of settings required carefully collecting a diverse variety of images that modeled the real-world scenarios in which the application could potentially be used.
