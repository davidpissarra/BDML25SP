This is an area where Large Language Models (LLMs) can play a key role. However, there is currently no benchmark dataset to evaluate the performance of LLM-based solutions. Here, we introduce the Aggregate Transaction Ledgers for Accounting Sustainability dataset or, ATLAS, and the initial evaluation results of four models using ATLAS. ATLAS is the first spend classification benchmark and is comprised of 10,000 synthetic, labeled spend items reflecting the distribution of corporate expenditures. We evaluate four baseline models, with the best model achieving a top-1 accuracy of 57.3% and a top-3 accuracy of 72.2%. ATLAS enables systematic evaluation of LLMs for spend classification. Our results provide a starting point for advancing automated carbon accounting and sustainability reporting for spend- based emissions. 1 Introduction 75% of the corporate emissions reported to CDP was from Scope 3 [1], which covers the upstream and downstream value chains [2]. Companies that report their Scope 3 emissions rely on third-party provided datasets, called emissions factors (EFs), to calculate their environmental impact [3]. The most prevalent estimation method utilizes EFs derived from Environmentally Extended Input Output (EEIO) models such as the USEEIOv2 [4]. These EFs convert expenditures on goods and services into estimated kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalents (kgCO2e), providing a crucial link between spend data and environmental impact. Applying the spend-based EFs to spend line items requires a mapping of spend line items to the EFs called “spend classification”. Beyond its role in estimating scope 3 emissions, spend classification is also essential for other corporate sustainability objectives, such as public reporting in line with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP), developing reduction strategies through supplier engagement, and managing expenditure to meet sustainability goals, as shown in Figure 1. ∗andrew.dumit@watershedclimate.com †sangwon@watershedclimate.com Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Figure 1: Processing steps involved in estimating carbon emissions from spend data. Spend classifi- cation task is highlighted for emphasis. BEA: Bureau of Economic Analysis. However, spend classification has its challenges. This step is particularly complex because it requires company-specific context of financial ledgers and the purposes of various expenditures, domain knowledge of carbon accounting principles, and a comprehensive understanding of the possible EFs. Should two companies apply different spend classification approaches to identical expenditures, their calculated carbon footprints may vary considerably. Further complicating the process is the sheer scale of the task—large corporations often manage thousands of spend accounts and millions of line items. LLMs have emerged as a promising solution to streamline this spend classification process. Several studies have proposed assistive or automated tools for spend classification. Balaji et al. [5] proposes a vector similarity based approach that achieves 75% EF matching precision on a dataset of 664 products. Jain et al. [6] evaluates zero-shot and supervised fine-tuning on a dataset of 2,162 financial ledger investments achieving 21% and 83% F1 industry-level classification respectively. However, to the best of our knowledge, no benchmark dataset of spend classification exists that allows systematic inter-comparison of different modeling approaches. In this study, we introduce ATLAS, the first spend classification benchmark dataset, along with the performance metrics of four baseline models. 2 ATLAS: Aggregate Transaction Ledgers for Accounting Sustainability The ATLAS dataset comprises 10,000 synthetic spend classifications spanning 9 macro industries and 8 countries. These labels encompass 295 unique classes, with 294 corresponding to Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) codes and one designated for non-emissive spend. The 294 codes cover 73% of the approximately 400 codes used by the BEA to classify economic activity. Since the BEA codes form the foundation of prominent EEIO models like USEEIO that account for 48% of EEIO usage in scope 3 emissions measurement [3], the ATLAS dataset also uses BEA codes for the labels. Non-emissive spend refers to transactions recorded in a company’s ledger that do not leave the company’s financial boundary or are not exchanged for goods or services [2]. Of the total mappings, 1,765 (17.6%) are classified as non-emissive. The ATLAS dataset is available for academic purposes upon request to the corresponding author. We generate the synthetic mappings based on metadata about each BEA sector A.3 using Claude 3.5 Sonnet [7] to match the label distribution of an internal private dataset of de-identified company spend accounts. We then modify the account names with rules observed in the private dataset. We review the synthesized account names for accuracy to the target label and ensure they reflect realistic inputs relative to the private dataset. Finally, we compare the performance of ATLAS against the private benchmark and observe that ATLAS is faithful to the difficulty and composition of the private\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
