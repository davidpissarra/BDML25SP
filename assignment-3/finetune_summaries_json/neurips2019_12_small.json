Supervised machine learning methods have the potential to overcome these issues, but their application to retroﬁt analysis has been limited. This paper serves as a novel showcase for how multivariate time series analysis with Gated Recurrent Units can be applied to targeted retroﬁt analysis via two case studies: (1) classiﬁcation of building heating system type and (2) prediction of building envelope thermal properties. 1 Introduction A growing body of research conﬁrms that retroﬁtting residential buildings provides a net reduction in carbon and energy use, as well as monetary savings [ 9][18][17][24]. The ﬁndings of these studies are reﬂected in international policies regarding building retroﬁts [ 17]. The development of large-scale computational approaches to building performance analysis are essential to the success of such retroﬁtting programs. Modern techniques for building assessment often involve expensive in-situ measurements and on-site appraisal [ 19][11][4][2], but researchers have started investigating the use of big data to scale this process [ 3] [22][23][10][15]. Supervised machine learning methods, however, are not typically applied to building retroﬁt analysis, in part because there is a lack of data with useful labels. Sensing technologies such as smart meters and thermostats are becoming increasingly ubiquitous, but they are most commonly used for time series forecasting, load proﬁle analysis or benchmarking, rather than prediction of particular building properties [ 20]. It is not clear what types of building characteristics can be predicted based only on time series measurement data. With all of these considerations in mind, the contributions of this paper are threefold: \u000fThe introduction of a deep learning approach that targets residential buildings for retroﬁt. \u000fA showcase of the types of building metadata that can be derived from multivariate time series data. \u000fHelping to overcome the data scarcity in the Civil Engineering domain by introducing a novel methodology for dataset generation. To accomplish these objectives two case studies will be presented - heat pump classiﬁcation and R-value prediction. Each of these cases focuses on a particular retroﬁtting strategy that will be 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.discussed in more detail in the following section. The remainder of this paper includes a description of the deep learning methods and model architecture, preliminary ﬁndings and a discussion of next steps. 2 Methodology 2.1 Case Studies Heat Pump Classiﬁcation: Load reduction measures in building retroﬁts involve upgrading me- chanical equipment such as appliances and HV AC systems [ 16]. Heat pumps are a particularly efﬁcient HV AC technology, and government programs already exist to encourage system upgrades [1]. The ability to target homes that do not have heat pumps would be highly beneﬁcial to these types of programs. R-Value Prediction: Thermal resistance, R (\u000eK W) is a material property that describes the effec- tiveness of insulation; the higher the R-value, the more effective the insulator. The area weighted average of R-values for all external surface provides a proxy for the quality of the building envelope. Envelope measures in building retroﬁts aim to increase the R-value by improving the constructions. An effective program should target buildings with relatively low values, but quantifying R is not trivial and the results can be difﬁcult to experimentally validate [19]. In this paper we propose a novel approach for predicting R using whole building simulation software. In our approach, computational physical modelling is used to simulate building behaviour based on inputs such as geometry and construction deﬁnitions. Unlike typical building assessment methods which use measurement data to deduce quantities about a building, our method uses building simulations to generate synthetic time series data. We postulate that one could build a predictor for R by training a deep learning model on this synthetic data. The model could then be used predict the R-value for a real building from measured data. The work in this paper focuses on the creation of the synthetic dataset and the model training; future work will validate the use of this approach on real buildings. 2.2 Data The dataset used for heating system classiﬁcation is acquired from ecobee’s Donate Your Data program1. This dataset consists of smart thermostat time series data measured at 5 minute increments as well as metadata describing household attributes. A detailed description of this dataset can be found at [ 14]. For the problem at hand indoor temperature, outdoor temperature and heating system runtimes are the input variables and presence of heat pump is the output variable. For the purpose of this study, only homes in Ontario and New York were considered. Of this subset there was a disproportionate number of homes with heat pumps.
