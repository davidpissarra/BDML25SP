Unlike other natural disasters, droughts have a slow onset and depend on various external factors, making drought detection in climate data difficult. In contrast to existing works that rely on simple relative drought indices as ground-truth data, we build upon soil moisture index (SMI) obtained from a hydrological model. This index is directly related to insufficiently available water to vegetation. Given ERA5-Land climate input data of six months with landuse information from MODIS satellite observation, we compare different models with and without sequential inductive bias in classifying droughts based on SMI. We use PR-AUC as the evaluation measure to account for the class imbalance and obtain promising results despite a challenging time-based split. We further show in an ablation study that the models retain their predictive capabilities given input data of coarser resolutions, as frequently encountered in climate models. 1 Introduction Drought is one of the most widespread and frequent natural disasters in the world, with profound economic, social, and environmental impacts [ 10]. Unlike other natural hazards, droughts are a gradual process, often have a long duration, cumulative impacts, and widespread extent [ 2]. Climate change is expected to increase the area and population affected by soil moisture droughts and also the probability of extreme drought events comparable to the one of 2003 across Europe [ 24,23]. Therefore, it is a critical scientific task to understand better possible changes in drought frequency and intensity under varying climate scenarios [ 11]. Drought is commonly classified into four categories: meteorological, agricultural, socioeconomic, and hydrological. In this study, we focus on agricultural drought since it has a considerable impact on human population evolution [ 16]. Agricultural droughts can be quantified as a “deficit of soil moisture relative to its seasonal climatology at a location” [ 26]. A low Soil Moisture Index (SMI) in the root zone is a direct indicator of agricultural drought and inhibits vegetative growth, directly affecting crop yield and therefore food security [ 10].

However, recently, machine learning (ML)-based methods have demonstrated their ability to capture hydrological phenomena well, e.g., rainfall-runoff [ 12] and flood [ 14]. ML has also been applied to drought detection but relied on relative indices as labels due to the lack of ground truth data [ 1,25,8]. Using such statistically derived labels can lead to unreliable detection of droughts in climate model projections and, accordingly, an inaccurate estimation of the impacts of future climate change [ 29]. Therefore, we compare several ML algorithms in their ability to classify droughts based on agriculturally highly relevant soil moisture.
