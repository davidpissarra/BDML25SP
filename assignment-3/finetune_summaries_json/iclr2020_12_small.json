We show that our trained model can generate realistic CRFs from the corresponding meteoro- logical observations, which represents a step towards a data-driven framework for stochastic cloud parameterization. 1 I NTRODUCTION Global Climate Models (GCMs) are one of the most important tools available to understand and anticipate the consequences of climate change, including changes in precipitation, increases in temperatures, and acceleration in glacial melting [ 22]. One of the key physical principles these models rely on is the Earth’s energy balance [ 14]: in short, the difference between how much energy the earth receives and how much it emits. In this context, it is paramount to model clouds accurately as they both reﬂect energy coming to the Earth and the infrared radiations it radiates [ 18]. However, as physical processes at play in cloud composition and evolution typically range from 10\u00006to106m, direct simulation of their behavior can consume up to 20% of a GCM’s computations - depending on their time and spatial scales [ 1,4,21]. Various efforts have tried to address this challenge. This includes traditional approaches that incorporate domain knowledge to build and validate model hypotheses using observations as well as sub-grid cloud modeling (known as super-parameterization). Alternatively, recent machine learning approaches use meteorological variables to model sub-grid clouds, thereby reducing the computational cost of super-parameterization [3, 19, 16, 25]. In this paper, we extend [ 25], a data-driven approach to contribute to cloud modeling, focusing on one of the main features used in energy balance calculations: reﬂectance ﬁelds. We use Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks [ 11] to generate these reﬂectance ﬁelds conditioned on meteorolog- ical variables1. We suggest using these generated images to extract important cloud parameters such as optical depth. We believe our approach is a step towards building a data-driven framework that can reduce the computational complexity in traditional cloud modeling techniques. Our goal is to model reﬂectance ﬁelds, which in turn could be used as a proxy for cloud optical depth, a major component of GCMs’ energy balance computations [ 9,5].

One key physical principle these models rely on is the Earth's energy balance: the difference between the energy the Earth receives and the energy it emits. Accurate modeling of clouds is crucial as they both reflect energy coming to the Earth and radiate infrared radiation.
