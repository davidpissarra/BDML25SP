In this study, we employed TomoSense, a 3D tomographic dataset, which utilizes a stack of single-look complex (SLC) images, a byproduct of SAR, captured at different incidence angles to generate a three-dimensional representation of the terrain. Our research focuses on evaluating multiple tabular machine-learning models using the height information derived from the tomographic image intensities to classify eight distinct tree species. The SLC data and tomographic imagery were analyzed across different polarimetric configurations and geosplit configurations. We investigated the impact of these variations on classification accuracy, comparing the performance of various tabular machine-learning models and optimizing them using Bayesian optimization. Additionally, we incorporated a proxy for actual tree height using point cloud data from Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) to provide height statistics associated with the model’s predictions. This comparison offers insights into the reliability of tomographic data in predicting tree species classification based on height. 1 Introduction and Methodology Tree classification is critical for preserving forests, protecting endangered species, and assessing carbon sequestration, among other ecological benefits Fassnacht et al. [2016]. This study lever- ages 3D tomographic images derived from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, generated by TomoSense—an experiment funded by the European Space Agency (ESA) Tebaldini et al. [2023]. These images have undergone comprehensive preprocessing, including co-registration, geometric correction, image alignment, and noise reduction. In anticipation of the ESA’s Biomass Satellite launch next year, which will operate in full tomographic mode for an entire year, this work explores the potential of tomographic images for accurate tree species classification. We utilized a manually classified dataset comprising eight distinct tree species within our area of interest, as outlined in Table 3, to serve as our ground truth. To achieve optimal classification results, we applied a range of tabular machine learning models, utilizing tabular data and enhancing performance through Bayesian optimization combined with Preprint.

This work establishes a framework for future large-scale forest inventories, potentially enhancing forest management, biodiversity assessments, and carbon stock estimations. 1.1 Scope and Related Work Tree species classification in forests typically involves a combination of morphological, physiological, and genetic methods to accurately identify and categorize different species Zhang et al. [2023]. Morphological methods rely on visible characteristics such as leaf shape, bark texture, tree height, and branching patterns. These features are often complemented by phenological observations, including flowering and fruiting times. Physiological methods can include analyzing the biochemical properties of tree tissues, such as leaf pigments or resin composition. Additionally, genetic methods, such as DNA barcoding and molecular markers, provide precise identification by analyzing the genetic material of the trees. In practice, these methods are often used in conjunction to improve accuracy, with field observations typically serving as the first step, followed by laboratory analysis when necessary. Advanced technologies, like remote sensing and machine learning, as employed in this work, are increasingly being integrated into species classification to enhance efficiency and precision, as well as enable global analysis Pu [2021]. The main stakeholders involved in tree species classification in forests, as in Pelyukh et al. [2021] include forestry professionals, conservationists, government agencies, researchers, and local commu- nities. Forestry professionals and government agencies rely on accurate classification for sustainable forest management, policy-making, and regulatory compliance. Conservationists use species data to prioritize areas for protection and restoration, aiming to preserve biodiversity. Researchers are involved in advancing scientific understanding of forest ecosystems, contributing to climate change models and ecological studies. Local communities, especially indigenous groups, ar stakeholders as they often possess traditional knowledge of species and rely on forests for their livelihoods, making their involvement essential for culturally and ecologically sensitive management practices. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data is increasingly being used to address the challenges of tree species classification in forests due to its ability to provide high-resolution, all-weather, and day- and-night imaging capabilities. Traditional methods of species classification, while effective, are often limited by accessibility, weather conditions, and the sheer scale of forested areas. SAR data overcomes these limitations by penetrating cloud cover and capturing detailed surface information, including tree structure and biomass, which are critical for distinguishing between species Ren et al. [2024]. This remote sensing technology allows for more comprehensive and frequent monitoring of forests, making it a valuable tool for stakeholders who require accurate and timely data for conservation, forest management, and ecological research. By integrating SAR data with other classification methods, the accuracy and efficiency of species identification are significantly enhanced, providing a robust solution to the challenges posed by traditional techniques. In the context of utilizing SAR data for tree species classification in forests, AutoGluon Erickson et al.
