Naturally this has a severe impact on a major percentage of the population inhabiting coastal land zones [18], with a recent study [12] placing 110 million people living below the local high tide line. Of all the different coastline types, sandy shores, forming 31% of the world’s beaches [14], undergo major erosion and accretion changes and hence are of special focus in this paper. Because of these reasons, it is paramount to regularly monitor the coastline changes across the world for better understanding, and to create necessary preparation and mitigation strategies. 1.1 Status Quo: Coastline Monitoring via Satellite Imaging Majority of remote-sensing datasets created in the past have been sourced from Sentinel and Landsat satellites (10m and 30m resolution respectively), across a timespan of many decades. As an example Luijendijk et al. [14] uses images from 32 years of capture since 1988. On top of this, when traditional image processing techniques are applied over single images to estimate shorelines it results in errors due to misalignment and time of capture. To address this issue, a moving average based composite image approach presented by Hagenaars et al. [4] reduces the error margin to a half-pixel precision value. Few other factors promoting the usage of remote sensing data are the ever-improving sources of data both in terms of resolution and frequency of capture, and in-situ approaches like land surveys being very difﬁcult and expensive to achieve. A recent review paper by Toure et al. [20] categorizes the shoreline detection algorithms into: \u000fSegmentation based approach: Using index like NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) orSWI (Superﬁne Water Index), followed by supervised and unsupervised approaches for pixel-based classiﬁcation. A recent work by Yang et al. [23] has utilized deep learning architecture for sea-land segmentation on Landsat images within a single geography. \u000fEdge Detection based approach: These approaches work at a ﬁner level to discern the precise shoreline. Heene et al. [5] have utilized Canny edge detector followed by post-processing to get the ﬁnal shorelines, whereas Kass et al. [9] have proposed an active contour approach, named Snake, to obtain initial set of edges that are further post-processed. \u000fBand Thresholding methods: Aedla et al. [1] have proposed adaptive thresholding and its variants, while Jishuang et al. [8] have used a threshold based morphological approach. However, due to the availability of better modeling approaches, these are running out of favor.

It consists of three classes, Land, Sea and Water-runup which have been colour coded.(best viewed in colour) Source: Google Earth, 2020. 1.2 Our Goal In order to estimate accurate shorelines, we use high-resolution (HR) Airbus SPOT imagery (1.5-2.5m resolution), this enables us to focus on the visible key indicators like the white foam created by waves hitting the shore and wet dark sand suggesting the maximum runup of the waves. For our dataset, we create a separate water-runup class, in addition to the usual sea and land classes. We convert the problem of shoreline detection to ﬁne-grained segmentation along the coast. We employ state-of-art deep learning algorithms to model this problem. Training and validation is conducted on individual images and further tested on few hotspot shoreline regions to showcase the observed change in a time-wise fashion. By doing so, we present a case for automated systems using HRsatellite imagery to monitor shoreline trends for high impact regions of the world. 2 Dataset The dataset is created using high-resolution ( HR) satellite imagery sourced from Airbus SPOT 5, 6 and 7 satellite constellation capturing the globe since 2003 with the panchromatic resolution of 1.5m and 2.5m. As already mentioned in section 1, sandy beaches are of high importance because of high population density, and loose soil texture resulting into heavy erosion and accretion phenomena. Another criteria taken into consideration for selection of regions is to diversify in order to accommodate variations incorporated by change in geographies.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy data removed:\n\nThe impact of Antarctic glacier melting has severe consequences for the population living in coastal areas. A recent study estimates that 110 million people reside below the high tide line. Among the various types of coastlines, sandy shores, which account for 31% of the world's beaches, undergo significant erosion and accretion changes. Therefore, it is essential to regularly monitor coastline changes worldwide to develop effective preparation and mitigation strategies.\n\n1.1 Status Quo: Coastline Monitoring via Satellite Imaging\n\nMost remote-sensing datasets have been sourced from Sentinel and Landsat satellites, with resolutions of 10m and 30m, respectively, over several decades. For instance, Luijendijk et al. used images from 32 years of capture since 1988. However, traditional image processing techniques applied to single images can result in errors due to misalignment and time of capture. To address this issue, a moving average-based composite image approach reduces the error margin to a half-pixel precision value.\n\nThe use of remote sensing data is promoted by the increasing availability of high-resolution and frequent data sources, as well as the difficulty and expense of in-situ approaches like land surveys. A recent review paper categorizes shoreline detection algorithms into three main approaches:\n\n1.  Segmentation-based approach: This involves using indices like NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) or SWI (Superfine Water Index), followed by supervised and unsupervised approaches for pixel-based classification. Yang et al. have utilized deep learning architecture for sea-land segmentation on Landsat images within a single geography.\n2.  Edge detection-based approach: These approaches work at a finer level to discern the precise shoreline. Heene et al. have used the Canny edge detector followed by post-processing to obtain the final shorelines, while Kass et al. have proposed an active contour approach, named Snake, to obtain an initial set of edges that are further post-processed.\n3.  Band thresholding methods: Aedla et al. have proposed adaptive thresholding and its variants, while Jishuang et al. have used a threshold-based morphological approach. However, due to the availability of better modeling approaches, these are less favored.\n\n1.2 Our Goal\n\nTo estimate accurate shorelines, we use high-resolution (HR) Airbus SPOT imagery (1.5-2.5m resolution), which enables us to focus on visible key indicators like the white foam created by waves hitting the shore and wet dark sand suggesting the maximum runup of the waves. For our dataset, we create a separate water-runup class, in addition to the usual sea and land classes. We convert the problem of shoreline detection to fine-grained segmentation along the coast. We employ state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms to model this problem. Training and validation are conducted on individual images, and further tested on a few hotspot shoreline regions to showcase the observed change in a time-wise fashion.\n\n2 Dataset\n\nThe dataset is created using high-resolution (HR) satellite imagery sourced from Airbus SPOT 5, 6, and 7 satellite constellation, capturing the globe since 2003, with a panchromatic resolution of 1.5m and 2.5m.
