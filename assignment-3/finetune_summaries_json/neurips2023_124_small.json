The analysis unveils a notable accuracy enhancement in the con- volutional neural network-based approach against the random forest model used for comparison. Our findings emphasize the potential of sophisticated machine learning methodologies in advancing LULC mapping accuracy, an essential stride towards data-driven, climate-relevant land management and policy decisions. 1 Introduction Earth observation and satellite remote sensing enable the mapping of global land use land cover (LULC) in a spatially explicit manner that informs policy and land management decisions aimed at reaching sustainable development goals [ 1]. However, despite the advances in technology and techniques used to create these maps, the accuracy of the segmentation of certain geographic areas remains an issue [ 2,3]. One of the main reasons is the quality and resolution of the satellite imagery used to create the maps. Also, some algorithms may not perform well in certain regions due to the complexity of the landscape or the presence of unique features that are not well represented in the training data used to develop the algorithms [ 4] [5]. For example, if the training data used to develop the algorithms is primarily collected from temperate regions and is then applied to a tropical region, the algorithms may not perform well in the tropical region due to the different types of vegetation and land cover present. With the advances in machine learning (ML) algorithms and cloud computing platforms for Earth observation, like Google Earth Engine (GEE) [ 6] and openEO [ 7], the Sentinel satellites have enabled the mapping of LULC maps at a 10 m resolution [ 8]. In this study, we focus on two LCLU products, (Esri and WC), annually updated. Esri is developed from a convolutional neural network model trained over 5 billion manually annotated Sentinel-2 pixel batches from 24k individual image tiles (510 x 510 pixels each) distributed worldwide. On the other hand, WC comes from an random forest model trained on manually labeled pixels in 100 x 100 m grids at 141k unique locations distributed worldwide. WC involves both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data as predictors as well. Given the importance of global LULC maps for several applications and the need for a full under- standing of how accurate a LULC product can be, this work aims to address the following key points: i) Evaluate two different LCLU products based on ML selecting a suitable ground truth available for 2 different locations., and ii) Propose a metric considering differences in ground truth due to location and highlight possible limitations of traditional reported accuracy.

Bias can arise due to factors such as differences in the quality or availability of data sources for different regions or land cover types. By selecting different geographic areas, researchers and map users can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of LULC maps and identify specific areas where improvements are needed particularly in regions that might have been underrepresented. In this study we select a representative country for the global north and south, Ecuador and Germany respectively. The Geo-Wiki (called before Global) [ 9] dataset is proposed to be the ground truth as it is a global reference dataset on cropland that was collected through a crowdsourcing. For comparison, while not too different in area for Ecuador there are only 846 data points related to croplands, while in Germany there are 11635 data points. Moreover, each sample unit is a frame-pixel of roughly 300 m x 300 m subdivided into 25 grid cells. Further examining the dataset we identified a difference in resolution within the dataset. Germany uses a resolution of roughly 20 x 30 m, but in Ecuador, the resolution is roughly 33 x 33 m. On the other hand, for Esri map, the pixel (grid cell) resolution is around 5 m x 5 m, while for WC the resolution is 7 m x 7 m.Thus, to account for the differences in\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
