Heating for homes and businesses accounts for over 75% of the energy used in the Arctic region. However, the lack of thorough and precise heating load estimations in these regions poses a significant obstacle to the transition to renewable energy. In order to accurately measure the massive heating demands in Alaska, this research pioneers a geospatial-first methodology that integrates remote sensing and machine learning techniques. Building characteristics such as height, size, year of construction, thawing degree days, and freezing degree days are extracted using open-source geospatial information in Google Earth Engine (GEE). These variables coupled with heating load forecasts from the AK Warm simulation program are used to train models that forecast heating loads on Alaska’s Railbelt utility grid. Our research greatly advances geospatial capability in this area and considerably informs the decarbonization activities currently in progress in Alaska. 1 Introduction Compared to the global average, global warming is occurring almost four times as fast in the state of Alaska [ 10]. In colder climates like those of Alaska and other arctic regions, heating homes and commercial buildings is a major contributor to global warming. In 2020, Alaska had the second highest petroleum usage, specifically for electricity needs, in the nation [ 12]. In addition, Alaska has high per capita energy consumption compared to the rest of the United States [ 12], which is often attributed to the energy needs due to the harsh climate. In order to decarbonize Alaska, domain experts require accurate, fine-grained estimates for heating loads at the neighborhood level. Here we provide these estimates at the building level. While providing these estimates at the building level yields privacy concerns (one reason our current estimates are not publicly available), in future work, building level estimates provide an opportunity for optional public participatory refinement of the heating load estimates. Researchers in Alaska need these heating load estimates to inform grid modernization, diversify energy sources, and advise retrofitting and other energy efficiency update programs in the state. All of which will directly assist in decarbonizing Alaska. Not only do researchers need these heating load estimates, but these ∗megaumer@uw.edu Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.estimates are also in demand at multiple levels of government. This proposal undertakes a proof of concept work to show it is possible to obtain these estimates through a top-down approach that is in direct contrast to the micro-level approaches currently used by researchers. 2 Previous Work The main limitation of current Alaskan heating load estimation work is its micro-level scale. This work often consists of invasive methods like visiting homes and installing various fuel use monitoring apparatuses, such as the PuMA pump [ 1]. These methods can have high levels of variation in fuel estimates between identical stove models because of variation in the mechanisms and sensitivity to pump placement. While these approaches can provide some estimations of household fuel use, they only do so at a small scale because of the labor intensive nature of the approach. It is impractical to visit each of the approximately 230,000 buildings in Alaska’s railbelt to install fuel use monitoring apparatuses or attempt other micro-level approaches to generate heating load estimates. While these projects do not yet provide us with an adequate sample of heating estimates for our machine learning approach, in the future, they provide an interesting opportunity for cross validation of our methods. In 2014, the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation published two regression relationships between the decade a home was built and the average energy use per square foot [ 2]. One of these relationships was for homes built in the Fairbanks Northstar Borough, and the other was for homes built in the Municipality of Anchorage. These regression relationships use input features from a comprehensive heating loads database coming from retrofitting efforts in Alaska that is currently in the process of becoming open source and heating load estimates from AK Warm, the standard software used for modeling heat in Alaska. This synthetic data and the corresponding regressions were not set up to be used for predictive purposes and do no generalize to the entire state of Alaska. Since the comprehensive heating loads database coming from retrofitting efforts in Alaska is not yet publicly available, we chose to assign buildings in Anchorage and Fairbanks BTU estimates coming from these two respective regression relationships, the only public version of this data at this time, to get preliminary results on our overall methods. 3 Methods 3.1 Data and Data Sampling In this project, we used Google Earth Engine [ 6], a tool used for open source geospatial big data analysis, to extract features from satellite data that we then passed to our model. All seven of the datasets used in this project are from Google Earth Engine’s public archive and consist of satellite images captured across time as well as geometries of building outlines in Alaska.
