Simulations are then done to verify the predicted performance of the new designs. Overall result suggests that ML based search can be used to discover new polymers optimized for carbon capture. 1 Introduction Global warming and associated climate change is one of the most pressing and challenging problems we are facing today [ 50]. Reduction in anthropogenic CO2 emissions is a critical in our efforts to \"prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with climate systems\"1. One of the main strategies for mitigating CO2 emissions is carbon capture. [ 7,24,42]. Membrane based separation methods are a major contender for energy efficient and flexible carbon capture technologies [24, 8] While polymeric membranes have been shown to be effective for seperation for small molecules [ 4], including CO2 [ 19,46], the current efficiency of these polymers is not enough for developing truly cost-efficient and flexible carbon capture systems [ 9,31]. One needs high CO2 permeable membranes with atleast moderately high CO2/gas selectivity. Increasing CO2 permeability and selectivity of mem branes are crucial for increasing the overall process throughput, reducing energy costs, and achieving removal of greater amounts of CO2. However, there exists a well-known negative correlation between these properties, which makes increasing both selectivity and permeability difficult [ 36,13]. This is often expressed in terms of the Robeson upper bound [ 36], which represents the frontier of this trade-off. Contribution Our objective in this work, is to develop a ML-driven approach to tackle the problem of designing polymer membranes focused on CO2 separation from air. As N2 and O2 are the dominant component of the atmosphere (comprising more than 99% of gases); high membrane selectivity for CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 pairs is important for this task; and so we focus on these metrics. From experimental data, we train an ensemble multi-task ML model to predict a polymer’s permeability for all three gases - CO2, N2, and O2 as well as its CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 selectivity. Then, we employ a RL based search algorithm to design new polymers and evaluated their performance with respect to the Robeson upper bounds using these machine learning models. Using this framework we were able to identify new polymer membranes that are promising for both CO2/N2 and CO2/O2 separations. 1https://unfccc.int/resource/ccsites/zimbab/conven/text/art02.htm Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.102 101 100101102103104105 Permeability P (for CO2)101102Selectivity  Robson Upper Bound(a) CO2/N2 102 101 100101102103104105 Permeability P (for CO2)101Selectivity  Robson Upper Bound (b) CO2/O2 Figure 1: Double logarithmic plots of selectivity versus CO2 permeability for gas pairs a) CO2/N2 and b) CO2/O2 from a database of existing molecules (e.g. PolyInfo[ 32],PI1M[ 27]). The Robeson upper-bound is marked in black line 2 Background and Related Work Robeson Bound The efficacy of gas seperation via a membrane is determined by two important factors a) permeability i.e. the rate at which a gas can pass through a membrane, and b) selectivity i.e. the ability of the membrane to selectively transport one gas while rejecting others. In the context of gas separation membranes, there is often a tradeoff between permeability and selectivity [ 36]. In Figure 1, we plot the selectivity and permeability of various polymers, and we can clearly see the general decreasing trend. While there are physical reasons for existence of this tradeoff [ 13], the Robeson bound is more an empirical bound than an intrinsic one [ 37,40]. Identifying new materials that break this upper bound has driven and continues to drive material research. Since Robeson’s initial work, improvement in polymer sciences have pushed outward this ’empirical’ Robeson bound [ 35,11]. Indeed, for many gas pairs the effective upper bounds was updated in 2019 [ 11]. In Figure1, we have plotted the empirical Robson bound from Comesaña-Gándara et al. [11] which can be considered to be a Pareto frontier of selectivity permeability tradeoff. ML-aided Polymer Design The accurate and efficient property prediction is essential to the design of polymers in various applications[ 26]. Traditionally, chemists and polymer scientists have relied on physical simulation to study and predict properties of various molecules. These simulations while accurate, are compute-intensive. On the other hand deep-ML models provide a quick inference method, which has led to them their rising popularity in the field of property prediction [14,1,22,10,29,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
