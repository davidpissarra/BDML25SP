In this paper, we propose a cascade framework to reduce this cost: we apply a small MLP on precomputed embeddings of each image patch to serve as a preliminary filter, identifying key patches that warrant further examination by more resource-intensive deep models. Our approach reduces per-task inference runtime by 5x with a <1% impact on accuracy. By reducing inference cost, our method enables nonprofits and other organizations with limited resources to scale monitoring efforts to more environmental and conservation applications. 1 Introduction Remote sensing methods have been developed to provide invaluable insights for environmental applications, including for tracking deforestation to preserve carbon sinks [ 1,2], detecting illegal fishing to protect marine ecosystems [ 3,4], and monitoring renewable energy infrastructure to assess clean energy transition progress [ 5]. However, global satellite imagery analysis presents significant challenges due to the vast volumes of data involved. For example, since 2015, the European Space Agency’s Sentinel-2 mission has been capturing 10 m/pixel images across the Earth. Processing monthly global Sentinel-2 mosaics from 2015-2024 with a Swin-Base model [ 6] would cost $25,000 on AWS. This is exacerbated as more deep models are developed that either improve on existing models or address new applications. For instance, after developing ten deep models, the cumulative cost balloons to $250,000. Many of these tasks involve objects or events that occur relatively sparsely across global satellite imagery. For instance, while forest loss is progressing at a tremendous pace, it typically affects a small percentage of global forest area in a given year. Similarly, objects like wind turbines and offshore oil platforms appear in a small fraction ( ∼1%) of global image patches. One way to reduce cost is to develop heuristic filters that restrict where the deep model is applied, e.g., wind turbines do not appear in residential areas. However, such heuristic filters offer a limited speedup, are error-prone, and are not easily adaptable to new tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a cascade framework for globally applying remote sensing models with sparsely occurring targets. Our approach replaces heuristic filters with small learned models that predict whether a patch contains at least one object instance based on precomputed image embeddings. We evaluate our method on two remote sensing tasks, and find that our method provides a substantial 5x reduction in per-task costs with an error rate of ≤1.2%across both tasks. Thus, Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Rather than exhaustively apply a compute-intensive, deep remote sensing model on every image patch, our cascade framework employs a small MLP trained to classify which patches contain at least one instance from precomputed embeddings. During inference, we prune patches where the MLP is confident that there are 0 instances, and only apply the deep model on the remaining patches. our method significantly accelerates satellite imagery analysis, addressing a critical bottleneck in large-scale environmental monitoring. 2 Related Work Cascade Filters for Video Analytics. Several approaches have been proposed for optimizing the analysis of large-scale video data. NoScope [ 7] achieves a 3x speedup in binary classification queries by employing a cascade of specialized models, including fast shallow CNNs trained on individual object categories and difference detectors that identify temporal changes between frames. BlazeIt [ 8] extents this approach for aggregate and limit queries. In our work, we adapt these methods for the remote sensing domain. Remote Sensing Foundation Models. Several foundation models have been developed for remote sensing, including SatlasPretrain [ 5], SeCo [ 9], and CACo [ 10]. These models compute strong representations of image patches; while linear probes over the embeddings can provide accurate outputs for many classification tasks, they are insufficient for most localization tasks. Applications in Renewable Energy Monitoring. Recent advancements in remote sensing for renew- able energy applications highlight the broader impact potential of the proposed cascade framework. For example, methods for mapping global rooftop solar potential now employ deep learning models to estimate digital surface models and segment roofs with high accuracy, enabling global scalability [ 11]. Similarly, enhanced U-Net architectures have been applied to detect photovoltaic facilities from multi-spectral satellite data, achieving fine-grained segmentation even in complex environments [ 12]. Incorporating the proposed cascade framework into these workflows could filter out regions unlikely to host relevant features, such as buildings or photovoltaic cells, thereby improving efficiency and reducing computational costs for large-scale analysis. 3 Methodology In this section, we detail our cascade inference approach that reduces the cost of detection or segmentation in remote sensing images. Rather than applying an expensive deep model on every image patch, we employ a fast multi-layer perceptron (MLP) over precomputed image embeddings to first identify patches that most likely contain zero targets. We then skip applying the deep model on those patches.
