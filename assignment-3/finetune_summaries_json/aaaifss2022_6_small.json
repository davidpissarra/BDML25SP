Transitioning to a coviable state in environmentally degraded and socially vulnerable territories is challenging. This paper present an ongoing French-Brazilian joint research project combining machine learning, agroecology, and social sci- ences to discover coviability pathways that can be adopted and implemented by local populations in the North-East re- gion of Brazil. Context The long-standing debate on how human societies can en- sure the equitable use of common natural resources, con- serve biodiversity and ecosystem functioning, and promote individual freedom and collective action (Ostr ¨om 2011) has been developed into several schools of thought that deﬁne sustainability in different ways depending on their relative emphasis on ecological, socio-economic and political pro- cesses (see Fisher et al. (2007) for a comprehensive review). One of such schools is founded on the emerging concept- paradigm of socio-ecological coviability, which refers to the multiple ways by which we can achieve a functional and persistent relationship between humans and non-humans un- der speciﬁc regulations and constraints (Barrire et al., 2019). This paper presents our ongoing French-Brazilian collab- orative project initiated in 2021 which aims at: (1) Estab- lishing a diagnosis of socio-ecological coviability for sev- eral sites of interest in Nordeste, the North-East region of Brazil (in the states of Para ´ıba, Cear ´a, Pernambuco, and Rio Grande do Norte respectively known for their biodiversity hotspots, droughts and vulnerabilities to climate change) us- ing advanced data science techniques for multisource and multimodal data fusion and (2) Finding transition path- ways towards coviability equilibrium using machine learn- ing techniques. Data collected in situ by scientists, ecolo- gists, and local actors combined with volunteered informa- tion, pictures from smart-phones, and data available on-line Copyright c 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

These indicators are useful to character- ize and monitor the socio-ecological coviability status along various dimensions of anthropization, human welfare, eco- logical and biodiversity balance, and ecosystem intactness and vulnerabilities. Among an inﬁnite space of possible transition strategies, AI technologies and reinforcement learning (RL) in particu- lar is applied to propose estimations and predictions of po- tential coviability pathways (or trajectories) for transition- ing from a diagnosis state to an ideal coviability target (or intended view) deﬁned by the user of the technology. Us- ing computational models, our project aims to predict alter- native solutions for coviability transitions at different time horizons and various spatial and temporal granularity levels. It will also reﬂect on the past and expose what would have happened had reality been different. The purpose of our re- search results is to be used by the local actors to be better informed and to improve the governance of territories fac- ing environmental degradation and ecological vulnerability. Our consortium is composed of ten institutions (57 permanent researchers) in France and Brazil, working in interdisciplinary collaborations in environmental sciences (agroecology, hydrology), informatics (data science, re- mote sensing, geomatics, and machine learning) and so- cial sciences (anthropology, social science, economics) lead by the Federal University of Para `ıba in Brazil and by IRD ESPACE-DEV research center in France. It in- volves four Brazilian universities (Federal University of Para`ıba (UFPB), Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), University of Sao Paulo (USP), Federal University of Pernambuco), four IRD1research units (UMR ESPACE DEV, IMBE, PALOC, UMMISCO) in France, FUNCEME (Fundac ¸ao Cearense de Meteorologia e Recursos H ´ıdricos), GBIF France and Brazil, and three collaborators: INCT On- daCBC2and INCT Odisseia3, and CEMA VE/ICMBio4.

    "answer": "Here's a rephrased version of the text, removing noisy characters and maintaining the original content:\n\nThe paper discusses socio-ecological arrangements and governance structures that enable humans and nature to coexist in functional, fair, and persistent ways. Transitioning to a sustainable state in environmentally degraded and socially vulnerable territories is challenging. This paper presents a French-Brazilian joint research project that combines machine learning, agroecology, and social sciences to discover pathways for sustainable coexistence in the North-East region of Brazil.\n\nThe long-standing debate on ensuring the equitable use of natural resources, conserving biodiversity, and promoting individual freedom and collective action has led to various schools of thought defining sustainability in different ways. One such school is based on the concept of socio-ecological coviability, which refers to the multiple ways to achieve a functional and persistent relationship between humans and non-humans under specific regulations and constraints.\n\nThis paper presents an ongoing collaborative project initiated in 2021, which aims to:\n\n1. Establish a diagnosis of socio-ecological coviability for several sites of interest in the North-East region of Brazil, using advanced data science techniques for multisource and multimodal data fusion.\n2. Find transition pathways towards coviability equilibrium using machine learning techniques.\n\nThe project combines data collected in situ by scientists, ecologists, and local actors with volunteered information, pictures from smartphones, and data available online, including satellite imagery, social media, surveys, etc. These data are used to compute various coviability indicators, which characterize and monitor the socio-ecological coviability status along dimensions of anthropization, human welfare, ecological and biodiversity balance, and ecosystem intactness and vulnerabilities.\n\nArtificial intelligence technologies and reinforcement learning are applied to propose estimations and predictions of potential coviability pathways for transitioning from a diagnosis state to an ideal coviability target. The project aims to predict alternative solutions for coviability transitions at different time horizons and various spatial and temporal granularity levels. It will also reflect on the past and expose what would have happened had reality been different.\n\nThe purpose of the research results is to inform local actors and improve the governance of territories facing environmental degradation and ecological vulnerability. The consortium consists of ten institutions in France and Brazil, working in interdisciplinary collaborations in environmental sciences, informatics, and social sciences, led by the Federal University of Paraíba in Brazil and the IRD ESPACE-DEV research center in France.\n\nThe consortium involves four Brazilian universities, four IRD research units, FUNCEME, GBIF France and Brazil, and three collaborators: INCT Onda CBC, INCT Odisseia, and CEMA VE/ICMBio. The research outcomes are intended to have deep societal, scientific, and economic impacts, and guide global conservation and restoration strategies towards the Nature Positive 2050 target.\n\nThis research project aims to provide an overview of its approach."
