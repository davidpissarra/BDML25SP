The physics-based models that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) uses to predict river levels and issue ofﬁcial ﬂood warnings are time-consuming and costly to use. These models rely on ﬁeld observations and calibration to small geographic areas and consequently their outputs are not generalizable across different river basins. If ﬂood prediction can be done without reliance on these expensive in-situ measurements it could reduce costs for existing ﬂood prediction systems as well as expand ﬂood prediction efforts to areas that could not previously afford river gauging infrastructure. Existing work using machine learning methods to predict ﬂood susceptibility has also been constrained to small geo- graphic areas. Khosravi et al. [9]predict ﬂood susceptibility in a single watershed, and Tayfur et al. [15] predict a hydro- graph for a single stretch of river. Assem et al. [1]predict river levels at 3 stations in a single catchment. Work by Kratzert et al. [10] on estimating runoff as a function of rain- fall using LSTMs suggests that machine learning models are able to generalize across many catchments in a manner that traditional models cannot, providing promising evidence that statistical ﬂood susceptibility models need not be lim- ited to small geographic areas. The work presented here explores prediction performance of generalizable, multi-basin models on two measures of ﬂood susceptibility using data from six U.S. states across more than six river basins: South Dakota, Nebraska, South Carolina, Virginia, New York, and New Jersey. The models trained in this work rely on USGS stream gauge data for ground truth and as inputs for a subset of our experiments, but also incorporates remotely-sensed data and is a step in the direction of a ﬂood prediction model that is less dependent on in-situ measurements. 2. Data To predict ﬂood susceptibility, we rely on information sourced from a mix of satellite-derived and in-situ data.

The ‘minor ﬂood’ threshold was used to binarize the USGS stream gauge readings for experiments that involve predicting ﬂood occurrence.

Records of time to peak river levels after precipitation events were obtained from the Flooded Locations & Simulated Hy- drographs (FLASH) Project [ 5]. The time-to-peak data was split into 4 bins with roughly equal frequency, a time to peak of less than 3:12hours, between 3:12and7:44 hours, between 7:44and18hours, and greater than 18hours, and assigned categorical labels indicating bin number.
