Introduction and Related Work Buildings, both residential and commercial, account for more than 50% of global electricity consumption and are also responsible for 40% of worldwide CO 2emissions (Al- louhi et al., 2015). In efforts to improve energy efﬁciency in buildings, researchers and industry leaders have attempted to implement control and automation approaches alongside techniques like incentive design and price adjustment to more effectively regulate the energy usage (Aswani & Tom- lin, 2012; Ratliff et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2019; Zou et al., 2019b). But, the occupants of a building typically lack the independent motivation necessary to optimize their energy usage and play a key role in the control of smart building infrastructure (Konstantakopoulos, 2018). So, there is a need for scalable and robust frameworks that can efﬁciently 1Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, UC Berkeley2Department of Industrial Engineering and Opera- tions Research, UC Berkeley.

We present an energy game-theoretic framework aimed at incentivizing occupants to modify their behavior in a competitive game setting so that the overall energy consumption in the building is reduced. Such frameworks have been successful in many different areas such as trans- portation (Qin et al., 2017), medical industry (Bestick et al., 2013) etc. Our framework can also be integrated with the electricity grid (Figure 1) to facilitate the adoption of more dynamic protocols for demand response (Shariatzadeh et al., 2015). We also benchmark the results for forecasting of energy resource usage patterns by leveraging classical ma- chine learning and deep learning methods. To make sure the data captures explainable human decision making behavior for energy usage, we perform feature correlation study using graphical lasso. 2. Design of Energy Social Game 2.1.
