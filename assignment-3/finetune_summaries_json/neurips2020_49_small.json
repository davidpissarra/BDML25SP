We experiment with several convolution neural network architectures to detect and classify waste items. Our best model, a deep learning residual neural network with 50 layers, achieves an average precision of 0.881 on the test set. We demonstrate the performance and efﬁciency of our app on a set of real-world images. 1 Introduction Every year, the world generates over 2 billion tons of solid waste [1]. In the U.S., even though 75% of this waste is capable of being recycled, only 34% is actually recycled [2]. Further, 91% of plastic isn’t recycled [3] and only about 5% of food and other organic waste is composted [4]. This waste generates over 1.5 billion metric tons of CO 2equivalent greenhouse gases [1], contributing nearly as much to climate change as all the cars on the U.S. roads. Despite massive investment to educate the public about accurate waste disposal, efforts so far have been only moderately successful. People are often confused by what they can recycle, or compost. Signs and boards found ubiquitously near waste bins are difﬁcult to understand and are often incomplete. Furthermore, disposal of waste varies based on the local recycling facilities’ capabilities, and therefore rules for disposal are subject to change on a county-by-county basis. Errors in waste disposal constitute not only missed opportunities to recycle or compost, but also lead to the contamination of recycling and compost bins. Often, an entire bin can end up at a landﬁll due to a single error leading to contamination. Data from the National Waste and Recycling Association shows that human confusion in the identiﬁcation and correct disposal of waste into our waste bins results in nearly 25% of recyclables getting contaminated [5], diverting materials that could be recycled into our landﬁll. When a recyclable or compostable material ends up in the landﬁll, it releases methane which is several times more potent than CO 2in contributing to global warming. Clearly, current ways to inform the public have not been working very well. In this work, we leverage the recent improvements of convolution neural networks (CNNs) for image-recognition tasks [6] and the availability of increased computational power on modern-day cell phones, to provide a novel approach for waste identiﬁcation that is fast, low-cost, and accurate for anyone, anywhere. We present DeepWaste, the ﬁrst mobile app targeted at the problem of erroneous waste disposal, at the point of disposal, through deep learning. We construct from scratch a fully-annotated dataset of more than 1200 waste items that is trained to achieve our best performing model with an average precision of 0.881 on the test set. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.2 Previous Work The topic of waste classiﬁcation has begun garnering some interest recently in research, but the attempts reported across literature to solve this problem have suffered from low accuracy (ranging from 22% to low 70%) [7], [8], or a network size that is too big for real-time application [9]. Further, most of the previous attempts to mitigate the aforementioned problem of erroneous disposal envisaged deployment within a “smart bin” or the use of a commercial and industrial grade binning system within a recycling plant [10], [11], [12], requiring expensive hardware that costs thousands of dollars. The high cost of these solutions has so far been a deterrent to their large-scale adoption. Our approach is novel, as it allows the use of widely available mobile phones, and therefore has the potential of large-scale adoption at little or no cost. Finally, none of the previous approaches have targeted compost classiﬁcation. This is a signiﬁcant problem because when compostable material such as food scraps and green waste gets into a landﬁll, it is generally compacted down and covered. This removes the oxygen and causes it to break down in an anaerobic process. Eventually, this releases methane, a greenhouse gas that is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide in warming the earth over a 100-year timescale (and more than 80 times on a 20-year timescale) [13]. Our work is the ﬁrst work in literature, to the best of our knowledge, that considers not only recycling but also compost as a new category for classiﬁcation. 3 Methods Classifying waste using machine learning is challenging for three reasons. First, whether a waste is recyclable or compostable or not depends on the properties of the material which can be hard to detect simply from the image.
