Advancements in the use of satellites to detect fire loca- tions provides opportunity to enhance fire spread forecasts from numerical models via data assimilation. In this work, a method is developed to infer the history of a wildfire from satellite measurements using a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (cWGAN), providing the information necessary to initialize coupled atmosphere-wildfire models in a physics-informed approach based on measurements. The cWGAN, trained with solutions from WRF-SFIRE, produces samples of fire arrival times (fire history) from the conditional distribution of ar- rival times given satellite measurements, and allows for assessment of prediction uncertainty. The method is tested on four California wildfires and predictions are compared against measured fire perimeters and reported ignition times. An average Sorensen’s coefficient of 0.81 for the fire perimeters and an average ignition time error of 32 minutes suggests that the method is highly accurate. 1 Introduction Climate change has induced increases in wildfire frequency and severity, with conditions conducive to large fires expected to become more common as climate predictions indicate drier summers and more heat in years to come [ 1–4]. Wildfires impact air quality, cause destruction of property and harm to health, and negatively influence atmospheric composition through the release of greenhouse gases, making wildfire behavior models critical [ 5–8]. Wildfires are strongly coupled to meteorological conditions, motivating the development of coupled wildfire-atmosphere models which aim to capture these interactions. However, issues of accumulated model errors leading to degraded forecasts exist, leading to interest in performing data assimilation [ 9–11]. Satellite-based active fire (AF) products are a commonly used measurement type for data assimilation which can provide AF detections with a resolution of up to 375 m at a temporal frequency of around 12 hours, however these measurements can have artifacts and are at spatio-temporal resolutions lower than current wildfire models [12]. For dynamic coupled atmosphere-wildfire spread models, the state of the system is represented by all the wildfire and atmosphere variables in the simulation. To perform data assimilation in this setting it has been demonstrated that if the precise history of a wildfire during its initial spread was known, then this history could be prescribed within a coupled wildfire-weather model to spin-up the atmosphere with the right amount of heat and mass flux added at the right place and time, yielding an atmospheric Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023state which is in sync with the fire state at the end of the initial phase, providing an initial condition to start a simulation from [ 13]. Thus, the data assimilation problem can be transformed to one of using satellite measurements to determine the history of a fire in the initial period, as succinctly represented by the fire arrival time which is defined as the time the fire arrives at a given location [13, 14]. Farguell et al. [15] used a support vector machine (SVM) to estimate fire arrival times based on satellite active fire data, however this method did not incorporate any physics inherent to wildfire spread into estimates and does not provide information about uncertainty. The method described here addresses these limitations, starting with a probabilistic interpretation of the problem where both the measured active fire pixels and the desired fire arrival time field are treated as random vectors. The inference problem is then one of quantifying the conditional probability distribution for the fire arrival time conditioned on a given measurement of active fire pixels. The measured fire pixels and the arrival time field are both high-dimensional random vectors, making this problem challenging to solve. To address this challenge, we utilize a conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (cWGAN) to learn and then sample from a conditional probability distribution. The approach uses wildfire simulation results from WRF-SFIRE for training, allowing the appropriate physics to be injected into predictions. The trained algorithm is applied retrospectively to four California wildfires and its performance is assessed; additional comparisons are made to the SVM-based method. 2 Problem formulation Letτdenote the matrix of fire arrival times whose components τijrepresent the fire arrival times for the i-th pixel along the longitude and the j-th pixel along the latitude. Assume there are Nτ such pixels and therefore τ∈Ωτ⊂RNτ. Each pixel is of size 60×60meters. A measurement operator Mmay be applied which transforms τinto a coarse, sparse, and noisy measurement ¯τusing the mapping M: Ωτ→Ω¯τ.
