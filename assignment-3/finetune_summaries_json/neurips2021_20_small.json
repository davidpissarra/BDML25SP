Therefore, to maintain enough energy on a power grid to match demand, utilities companies rely on reserve power sources that typically come from fossil fuels and therefore pollute the environment. Accurate short-term PV power prediction enables operators to maximize the amount of power obtained from PV panels and safely reduce the reserve energy needed from fossil fuel sources. While several studies have developed machine learning models to predict solar irradiance at speciﬁc PV generation facilities, little work has been done to model short-term solar irradiance on a global scale. Furthermore, models that have been developed are proprietary and have architectures that are not publicly available or rely on computationally demanding Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models. Here, we propose a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory Network model that treats solar nowcasting as a next frame prediction problem, is more efﬁcient than NWP models and has a straightforward, reproducible architecture. Our models can predict solar irradiance for entire North America for up to 3 hours in under 60 seconds on a single machine without a GPU and has a RMSE of 120 W=m2when evaluated on 2 months of data. 1 Introduction Solar photovoltaic (PV) power generation has gained signiﬁcant popularity and attention in the past few decades. According to studies, it is expected to account for almost 80% of the increase in renewable energy generation through 2050 [ 1]. Moreover, solar power is required to reduce the \u001825% of global greenhouse gas emissions that stem from the energy sector each year [ 2,3]. Despite its popularity, environmental-friendliness and the vast amount of energy available, solar power is associated with intermittency and uncertainty – its output can substantially rise or fall instantaneously based on the cloud layers between the sun and the solar panels. To avoid power blackouts and damage of equipment, electricity grids need to remain balanced within a narrow range at all times. This is typically accomplished by utilizing backup generators [ 4], and sometimes using battery reserves [ 5] and demand-response scheduling [ 6]. However, these solutions have their own limitations. As for the most popular solution, backup generators run on fossil fuels and their power ascend and decline rate is restricted by the unit ramp rate which results in difﬁculties to meet incremental power generation needs [ 7]. Large-scale battery technologies on the other hand are expensive and difﬁcult to realize. Lastly, demand-response scheduling is challenging due to the \u0003Equal Contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.lack of information on temporal consumption and power available. Near-term accurate forecasting of solar energy production may allow a utility to store energy in advance or avoid spinning reserves thus improving cost-effectiveness and security [8, 9, 10, 11]. Recently, solar power prediction has been widely studied using ground data and satellite imaging. For example, Hu et al. uses ground-based images to predict production at a solar plant in Hangzhou, China [ 12]. There has also been much research aimed at predicting PV power over a geographical range, such as Mathe et al. [ 13], where they trained a deep learning model on satellite images in order to predict total daily PV output for the entire nation of Germany. Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models (such as one used by Verbois et al. [ 14]) are often used for solar irradiation prediction, which involve extensive computational overhead and are more suitable for predicting long-term horizons (e.g. days). Furthermore, utility-scale solar farms invest in developing their own models to predict power production but the distributed nature of solar installations with millions of small sites encourages automated and efﬁcient prediction models for a wide area. In this paper, we predict solar irradiance using a Convolutional LSTM model architecture for the entire North America. We use satellite images of irradiance and treat this as a next-frame prediction problem; this allows for the development of a model that is simple, computationally efﬁcient, and reproducible. Since each pixel in the predicted frame represents a geographic area, predictions can be made at both the local and national scales. Our models predict solar irradiance for North America for up to 3 hours in under 60 seconds on a single machine without a GPU and has a RMSE of 120 W=m2when evaluated on 2 months of data. 2 Data and Methodology A standard approach to predict future solar irradiance consists of using weather features to compute and predict irradiance. Many factors must be considered to determine solar irradiance such as cloud type, cloud depth, aerosol type, aerosol depth, ozone, wind speed, wind direction, ground location and solar zenith angle. This information is needed for every prediction location, which makes traditional numerical modeling processes very complex and computationally intensive.
