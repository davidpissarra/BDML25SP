Ideally these forecasts are equipped with error bars, so that downstream decisions can account for uncertainty. To produce predictions with error bars in this setting, we consider Gaussian processes (GPs) for modelling and predicting solar photovoltaic energy production in the UK. A standard application of GP regression on the PV timeseries data is infeasible due to the large data size and non-Gaussianity of PV readings. However, this is made possible by leveraging recent advances in scalable GP inference, in particular, by using the state-space form of GPs, combined with modern variational inference techniques. The resulting model is not only scalable to large datasets but can also handle continuous data streams via Kalman filtering. 1 Introduction On Tuesday, 19 July 2022, Britain paid the highest electricity price ever recorded, at a staggering £9724 per megawatt hour. This (quite horrible) achievement was due to a deep imbalance in the supply and demand of the national power grid, which was under severe stress caused by the hottest UK day on record, and by the recent surge in natural gas prices [ 1]. It is apparent that our continual reliance on natural gas had enabled this perfect storm; it can be argued that our energy system may have been more resilient had there been a larger proportion of renewables in the mix. However, managing supply and demand through renewables is not easy. Solar power, among most other renewables, is intermittent, making it necessary to back it up with spinning reserves to provide energy when the sun is not shining. These spinning reserves are, unfortunately, expensive and emit large amounts of CO2 [ 12]. Thus, by increasing the accuracy of forecasts for renewable electricity supply, one can hope to reduce the amount of spinning reserves and in turn, decrease emissions and costs associated with the use of clean energy sources. ∗Also with Balyasny Asset Management Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: PV output at stations distributed across the UK at different times. Naturally, there has been a surge of recent works applying machine learning to the task of photovoltaic energy (PV) nowcasting. For example in [ 18], a comparative study of several deep learning models for the task of one-minute ahead PV value prediction is conducted. Similarly, in [ 10], a physics- constrained LSTM architecture is considered for one-hour ahead PV prediction (see also [ 3,15] for comprehensive reviews on the application of ML models for PV nowcasting). While these deep learning models outperform simple baselines, such as persistence, they do not quantify uncertainty, which we believe is necessary for high-stakes applications such as this. In this paper, we propose the use of Gaussian processes (GPs) for PV nowcasting as alternative to deep-learning based approaches. These are nonparametric Bayesian regression method that can produce predictions equipped with uncertainty estimates [17], which could be useful in our setting. 2 Data The dataset that we use in this work was provided to us by Open Climate Fix2, consisting of solar PV energy (PVE) readings at 5 minute intervals for 1311 PV stations scattered across Great Britain, between January 2018 and November 2021 (see Figure 1). We preprocess the data by first clipping the PV values between 0W and 5×107W to remove outliers. This was then re-scaled by dividing each observation by the total capacity of the corresponding PV station, resulting in readings between [0,1]. Data from stations that showed non-zero production overnight or contained missing observations were removed. Finally, the time series were sliced to only include data between 8:00 and 16:00. The resulting timeseries (yi)N i=1at a single station is displayed in Figure 2, which shows strong annual and daily seasonality. Figure 2: PV timeseries plot at annual and daily scales. The seasonality at the two scales are apparent. 2https://huggingface.co/datasets/openclimatefix/uk_pv 23 Methodology To keep this paper self-contained, we supplement the readers with necessary background on GPs and details regarding our methodology in Appendix A. 3.1 Model To benchmark our results on the PV nowcasting task, we consider two GPs to model the latent timeseries f(t): the first is a plain Matérn-3/2 GP and in the second, we add a quasi-periodic component, which itself is a product between a periodic kernel and a Matérn-3/2 kernel: kmodel 1 (t, t′) =kmatérn- 3/2(t, t′), (1) kmodel 2 (t, t′) =kmatérn- 3/2(t, t′) +kmatérn- 3/2(t, t′)kperiodic (t, t′).
