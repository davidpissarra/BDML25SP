While using a synthetic historical dataset based on real- world sources, our evaluations reveal substantial environmental beneﬁts without demanding drastic personal sacriﬁces, even if consumers accept only a fraction of the recommendations. 1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goals [52] (SDGs) outlined by the United Nations (UN) encompass various sustainability criteria crucial for the long-term well-being of societies and the environment [29]. Environmental and societal sustainability goals entail multiple constraints and objectives affecting everyday decision-making [37, 10]. However, reconciling these objectives might involve intricate trade-offs; for instance, minimizing CO 2emissions in one activity might inadvertently increase its water footprint. Adopting a value sensitive design [53] necessitates considering personal values, including preferences, tastes, and budget constraints. Researchers anticipate Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to play a pivotal role in tackling the complex challenges posed by the SDGs [56]. However, AI applications pose new challenges in aligning with value sensitive design, notably concerning unequal resource distribution, loss of individual autonomy and privacy, and increased emissions from computations [56, 23]. Value sensitive design in AI systems aims to tackle these challenges by integrating personal and societal values as objectives or constraints [53]. Prior approaches in value sensitive recommender systems have concentrated on individual mobile platform and website applications [4]. Such approaches may beneﬁt from more comprehensive quan- titative assessments of their collective impact. Such systems have the potential to guide individuals toward more sustainable consumption consciously [24]. While existing recommender systems often focus on speciﬁc aspects like diets or single product recommendations [1, 51, 50], our work builds on modern multi-objective design principles to address emerging complex trade-offs using optimization techniques [67, 65, 43, 44, 22, 38, 1] The main contributions of the current article are to (i) propose and formalize a real-world multi- objective optimization problem for recommendations of personalized sustainable baskets, (ii) create Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.and analyze a novel synthetic dataset based on sustainability factors and consumer real-world data, (iii) propose effective recommender baselines and quantify their impact on environmental criteria, and (iv) introduce a novel deep learning framework for mixed integer programming and multi-objective optimization problems. 2 Preliminaries Related Work: Classic approaches in recommender systems fall into two primary categories, often combined [48]: (i) Collaborative ﬁltering, which centers on user-item interactions and recommends items based on user similarities. (ii) Content-based (and context-aware) ﬁltering applications mainly consider item attributes and item-item similarities. Applications in both categories often overlook the environmental aspects of products, focusing solely on past user shopping behavior without sustainability considerations. Extending these approaches involves incorporating environmental and personal product selection criteria and using advanced methods to ﬁnd similar products or users [18, 41, 26]. However, this becomes feasible only when the computation allows for a manageable enumeration of choices and similarity criteria, especially at the individual product level. On the basket level, sequence recommendations can lead to a combinatorial explosion, making it unfeasible to iterate all possible baskets across various criteria within a reasonable time [47]. Expanding the search and feature spaces, typically when considering shopping baskets that satisfy multiple personal and environmental criteria, poses challenges requiring improved metrics [40] and more advanced sampling techniques for training [59, 60]. Recommending sustainable baskets also requires considering resolving several trade-offs [46] be- tween multiple criteria such as climate, health, and responsible consumption. Therefore, we consider a recommendation approach that actively searches for Pareto optimal baskets across consumer criteria by constructing them via optimization [18]. Multi-objective optimization, applied in the food industry, production, and supply chains, emerges as a relevant strategy for us [43, 2, 39, 57]. Selecting the optimal number of products for a consumer basket under budget and value sensitive constraints resembles a multi-objective and multi-dimensional knapsack problem [36]. Solving such problems via constraint optimization and linear/dynamic programming may prove challenging, requiring more efﬁcient polynomial time approximations [32]. Linear programming relaxation methods may struggle with complex problems [5, 58]. Regularization methods resembling scalarization techniques [65] offer an alternative for solving these problems but require extensive ﬁtting and intricate interpretation of Lagrange coefﬁcients for each objective [64]. Classic evolutionary algorithms (EAs) [65], which can also be combined with scalarization methods, are frequently considered in the relevant litera- ture [22, 14]. Our focus in this article lies on EAs, which seem adept at efﬁciently handling complex multi-objective optimization problems with multiple (more than 5) objectives and intricate trade-offs.
