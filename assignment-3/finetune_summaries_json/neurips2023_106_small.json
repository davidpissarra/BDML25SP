Consequently, battery- swapping services emerge as an attractive solution for these trucks. This paper employs a two-fold approach to investigate the potential and enhance the efficacy of such services. Firstly, spatial-temporal demand prediction models are adopted to predict the traffic patterns for the upcoming hours. Subsequently, the prediction guides an optimization module for efficient battery allocation and deployment. Analyzing the heavy-duty truck data on a highway network spanning over 2,500 miles, our model and analysis underscore the value of prediction/machine learning in facilitating future decision-makings. In particular, we find that the initial phase of implementing battery-swapping services favors mobile battery-swapping stations, but as the system matures, fixed-location stations are preferred. 1 Introduction The global challenge of carbon emissions has exhibited different patterns and witnessed various responses across sectors. In 2021, 21.2% of these emissions are attributed to the transportation sector ([ 4]). While substantial progress has been made in the electrification of passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks remain notably falling behind in this transition. In contrast, heavy-duty trucks, though accounting for less than 10% of the total vehicle population, are responsible for more than 40% of carbon dioxide emissions ([ 7,14,24]). This disparity underscores the opportunity for mitigating transportation environment impact via the electrification of heavy-duty trucks. In practice, several factors contribute to the lagging electrification of heavy-duty trucks, chiefly among them are the limitations in battery size and energy density, range anxiety, and long charging durations. However, as EV technology advances and battery costs decrease, battery swapping stations are emerging as an economically viable solution for business proprietors and station operators ([27]). To take China as an example, state-owned highway companies have shown significant interest in exploring the commercial potential of establishing battery swapping stations (BSS) specifically for heavy-duty trucks. These entities, responsible for constructing and overseeing state-owned highways and associated infrastructure (such as service areas, power stations, and charging stations), posit that (i) service areas spaced every 50 miles, (ii) combined with swift battery swapping services, and (iii) electric vehicles’ reduced operational cost per mile (compared with traditional vehicles), can strongly boost the electrification for heavy-duty trucks. ∗Corresponding to: guanting@unc.edu Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023.ML model Planning model Input Graph structureInput Traffic  time seriesOutput/Input Future traffic  time seriesOutput Allocation of BSS  and batteries(a) Our methodology: The ML model takes two inputs of traffic time series and road network/graph and out- puts the future traffic prediction for a window of the next few hours.

Our methodology adopts a “predict-then-optimize” pipeline (Figure 1a). Utilizing traffic data of heavy-duty trucks, we employ spatial-temporal machine learning prediction models to forecast traffic volume in upcoming hours. Leveraging these predictions, we then solve an integer program to derive a dynamic scheduling policy for BSS operations. Our work is in collaboration with the Chongqing Expressway Group Company (CEGC), a key entity in charge of the development and management of highways in Chongqing, China, a municipality spanning 31,700 square miles (the largest municipality area in the world) and a population over 32 million. Our prediction approach is closely related to the literature on machine learning methods for traffic forecasting. As neural network (NN) methods evolve ([ 8,12,10,21]), NN-based traffic prediction methods ([ 15,6,26,22]) have become increasing effective. In the traffic prediction literature, there is also a growing interest in leveraging machine methods for climate-change-related goals ([ 2,18,5,9]). The predicted traffic volume is used to optimize the operations of BSS, which is related to the vast literature of planning and management for electric vehicles ([ 13,23,11,17,20]) and energy systems ([25, 16, 3]). Here we summarize our key findings. From a prediction perspective, based on our dataset, we observe that the integration of the attention module ([ 21]) enhances the prediction accuracy of the GCN-based model for longer horizons. In terms of the service rate, compared to the hindsight optimal strategy where the ground truth is known, our predict-then-optimize approach demonstrates robust performance across various environments. Our investigation also sheds light on the planning choice between fixed BSS (a BSS with a fixed location) and mobile BSS (a BSS\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
