However, due to their exorbitant computational costs, they can only be employed for a limited period and geographical area. To address this, we propose a more cost-effective method powered by an emerging machine learning approach to better understand the intricate dynamics of the climate system. Our approach involves active learning techniques by leveraging high-resolution climate simulation as an oracle that is queried based on an abundant amount of unlabeled data drawn from satellite observations. In particular, we aim to predict autoconversion rates, a crucial step in precipitation formation, while significantly reducing the need for a large number of labeled instances. In this study, we present novel methods: custom query strategy fusion for labeling instances – weight fusion (WiFi) and merge fusion (MeFi) – along with active feature selection based on SHAP. These methods are designed to tackle real-world challenges – in this case, climate change, with a specific focus on the prediction of autoconversion rates – due to their simplicity and practicality in application. 1 Introduction Precipitation is a crucial weather and climate phenomenon, with its formation rate being influenced by various factors, including interactions among aerosols, clouds, and precipitation. Understanding these interactions is vital for improving future climate projections, as they represent a major source of uncertainty in estimating climate change’s radiative forcing [IPCC, 2021]. High-resolution simulations, such as the ICON-LEM [Zängl et al., 2015, Dipankar et al., 2015, Heinze et al., 2017], offer valuable insights into these interactions. However, it is computationally very expensive. For instance, running ICON-LEM to simulate a single hour of climate data over Germany requires around 13 hours on 300 computer nodes and incurs a cost of approximately EUR 100,000 per day [Costa-Surós et al., 2020]. Given these high costs, it is imperative to seek alternative approaches for understanding complex climate system. Thus, we propose developing a machine learning (ML) model with active learning (AL) techniques to predict autoconversion rates, a key process in precipitation (rain) formation, which in turn is key to better understanding cloud responses to anthropogenic aerosols [Albrecht, 1989]. In particular, we propose to use a high-resolution ICON-LEM as an oracle that is queried based on an abundant Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Algorithm 1 Active Learning with SHAP-Based Feature Selection 1:Input :Dinit,D,Xus,P,M,Bmax,z∈Rp,tOutput :ˆM,ˆz: Final model and features 2:D←Dinit,ˆz←z,ˆM ← ∅ 3:while|D|≤Bmaxdo 4: if|D|=|Dinit|or|D|=Bmax 2or|D|=Bmaxthen 5: ˆM ← train(M, Dz);ϕj=SHAP (ˆM,zj),∀j;ˆz←z\\ {j:|ϕj|< t} 6: end if 7: ˆM ← train(M, Dˆz) 8: P←Active Learning Step (ˆM, Xus) 9: Ask oracle to label points in P;D←D∪P;Xus←Xus\\xi:xi∈P 10:end while 11:return ˆM,ˆz amount of unlabeled data drawn from satellite data. Our aim with active learning is to minimize the number of labeled instances required to train the machine learning model. We will demonstrate that active learning allows us to achieve greater accuracy with fewer labeled data points by selecting the most valuable instances from a pool of unlabeled data, thus reducing overall costs. Several AL algorithms have attempted to combine both informativeness and representativeness measures when selecting optimal query instances, primarily in the context of classification problems [Du et al., 2017, Huang et al., 2014]. Yang et al. [2015] introduced an approach that strives to maximize diversity. Our method draws inspiration from the principles of combining informativeness, representativeness, and diversity, akin to the approach undertaken by He et al. [2014] and Novitasari [2017]. However, our method is specifically tailored for regression problems, setting it apart from the aforementioned classification-focused. Our research contributes to the field in several significant ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply AL in the field of high-resolution climate modeling, specifically within the context of the very expensive ICON-LEM simulation, with a specific focus on the autoconversion process – a process by which cloud droplets grow larger and transform into raindrops.
