Machine learning models such as Deep Gaus- sian Processes (DGPs) can be used to radically re-define how decision makers can use models by creating a ‘surrogate model’ or ‘emulator’ of the original model. Surrogate models can then be embedded into apps that decisions makers can use to directly explore a vast array of policy options corresponding to potential target outcomes (model inversion). To illustrate the mechanism, we give an example of application that is envisaged as part of the UK government’s Net Zero strategy. To achieve Net Zero CO 2emissions by 2050, the UK government is consider- ing multiple options that include planting trees to capture carbon. However, the amount of CO 2captured by the trees depend on a large number of factors that include climate conditions, soil type, soil carbon, tree type,... Depending on these factors the net balance of carbon removal after planting trees may not necessarily be positive. Hence, choosing the right place to plant the right tree is very impor- tant. A decision-helping model has been developed to tackle this problem. For a given policy input, the model outputs its impact in terms of CO 2sequestration, biodiversity and other ecosystem services. We show how DGPs can be used to create a surrogate model of this original afforestation model and how these can be embedded into an R shiny app that can then be directly used by decision makers. 1 I NTRODUCTION We consider a model, or network of models being used to support decision making as a black box with vector-valued inputs and outputs. Surrogate modelling aims to create a statistical model that quickly and accurately predicts the original model with a well-calibrated measure of uncertainty, for example providing a mean and variance for any value of the model inputs, or a full probability distribution Gramacy (2020). A surrogate model can be used to support decision makers, enabling them to understand the predicted consequences of any policy that can be evaluated by the model in real-time. Another main advantage of the surrogate modelling approach is that the model can be “inverted”, i.e. the space of inputs compatible with given targets on the outputs can be obtained and explored. Though surrogates based on Neural Networks are possible if sufficiently many model evaluations are available to densely cover the input space, environmental models are typically too computationally expensive to provide sufficiently rich training sets. We use deep Gaussian Pro- cesses (hereafter DGPs Damianou & Lawrence (2013), Ming et al. (2023)), which have been shown to perform well for environmental models Williamson et al. (2013). Gaussian processes (GPs) are distributions over functions s.t. any finite collection of function evaluations follows a multivariate Normal distribution with mean and variance matrix given by the mean and covariance functions of the process. A DGP composes GPs in layers (much like a Neural Network composes transfer func- tions) to enable flexible learning of non-stationary functions. Although DGPs can be fitted to some outputs of the model directly, some outputs are too high-dimensional for this to be efficient. A gen- 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 eral approach, based on Salter et al. (2019); Chang et al. (2016) involves projecting the output onto a low-dimensional basis that captures the majority of the output variability in response to changes in the input. Denote the N-dimensional model output, Y(x), at input locations x, where Y(x)is assumed to represent a single variable, but perhaps over space and time (note the approach below can be repeated for each variable). The approach finds decompositions such that Y(x)≈g(µ+KW (x)), where Kis a matrix of basis vectors, W(x)is a vector of Jcoefficients with J << N,µis the ensemble mean and gis a function transforming (−∞,∞)Nto the appropriate space for the model output (e.g. strictly positive Ymight use an exponential function for g). Constructing KandW(x) so that the entries of W(x)are uncorrelated, we can model each component as: Wk(x)∼DGP\u0000 µk(x), σ2 k(x)\u0001 ; k= 1,..., J In the rest of this document, we introduce a model for exploring the efficacy of tree-planting incen- tivisation policies on Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity, and show how surrogates for this model can be deployed to provide a novel form of decision support. In section 2, we intro- duce the model. In section 3, we then describe our surrogate models and how they can be used in inversion for decision support.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and text removed:\n\nDecision-makers do not directly use the results of complex models, which are often presented by experts as a limited number of potential scenarios resulting from a limited number of policy choices. Machine learning models, such as Deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs), can be used to create a'surrogate model' or 'emulator' of the original model. This allows decision-makers to directly explore a vast array of policy options corresponding to potential target outcomes through model inversion.\n\nTo illustrate this mechanism, we consider an example related to the UK government's Net Zero strategy. To achieve Net Zero CO2 emissions by 2050, the UK government is considering multiple options, including planting trees to capture carbon. However, the amount of CO2 captured by trees depends on various factors, such as climate conditions, soil type, soil carbon, and tree type. Choosing the right place to plant the right tree is crucial, as the net balance of carbon removal after planting trees may not necessarily be positive. A decision-helping model has been developed to tackle this problem.
