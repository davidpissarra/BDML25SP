Investments in renewable energy must be made over a long time horizon to max- imise return of investment of these long life power generators. Over these long time horizons, there exist multiple uncertainties, for example in future electricity demand and costs to consumers and investors. To mitigate for imperfect information of the future, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize for a low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply using a modiﬁed version of the FTT:Power model. In this work, we model the UK and Ireland electricity markets. The DDPG algorithm is able to learn the optimum electricity mix through experience and achieves this between the years of 2017 and 2050. We ﬁnd that a change from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewables, based upon wind, solar and wave would provide a cheap and low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels. 1 Introduction To prevent climate change, a movement from a high carbon electricity supply to a low-carbon system is required [ 1]. Low carbon electricity supply will aid in the decarbonization of the automotive and heating sectors by allowing for low-carbon electricity to be used in place of oil and gas. Renewable energy costs, such as solar and wind energy, have reduced over the last ten years, making them cost-competitive with fossil fuels. These price drops are projected to continue [ 2]. The future cost of operating and capital cost of electricity generation and electricity demand, however, remain uncertain over the long-term future. These uncertainties are risks which investors must analyze while making long-term decisions. In this paper, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm to simulate the behaviour of investors over a 33-year horizon, between 2017 and 2050 using the FTT:Power model [ 3]. FTT:Power is a global power systems model that uses logistic differential equations to simulate technology switching [ 4].

We start in this year due to the prior parameteriza- tion of the FTT:Power model with historical data up until this time. We projected until 2050 because this is a common target for governments to reach zero carbon. The environment used was a modiﬁed version of the FTT:Power model. We modiﬁed the FTT:Power model to use the DDPG algorithm in place of the logistic differential equations to make investment decisions. In addition, we simulated two countries: the United Kingdom and Ireland. We choose these due to the wealth of prior work on these countries which can be used use for comparison [ 5,6]. The DDPG algorithm allows us to simulate the decisions made by investors under imperfect information, such as future electricity costs, taxes and demand. This work enabled us to see an optimal, ﬁnal state electricity generation mix. Prior work in this domain has tackled the capacity expansion problem. For example, Oliveira et al. also use reinforcement learning for the capacity expansion problem [ 7]. Whilst Oliveria et al. provide detailed calculations of agents for the capacity expansion problem, we reduce this complexity to a series of observations of the environment, to allow for emergent behaviour. Kazempour et al. use a mixed-integer linear programming approach to solve the generation investment problem [ 8]. In contrast our approach removes the requirement for full knowledge of the time-horizon. Through this work, it is possible to assess whether a low cost, low-carbon electricity mix is viable over the long-term using a deep reinforcement learning investment algorithm, as well as ﬁnding what this optimum mix should be. This work enables us to closely match the investment behaviour of rational agents, without knowledge of the future. It can help guide investors on the choice and proportion of technologies to invest in over the long term. 2 Model and methodology The Future Technology Transformations system for the power sector model (FTT:Power) model represents global power systems based on market competition, induced technological change and natural resource use and depletion [ 4]. This technological change is dependent on previous cumulative investment [ 4]. The model uses a dynamic set of logistic differential equations for competition between technology options. For this work, we modiﬁed the FTT:Power model to use the deep reinforcement learning investment algorithm, DDPG. That is, the DDPG algorithm was used to make the decision on size of investment for each technology. In addition, we reduced the model only to consider the countries of Ireland and the UK. This enables us to iterate\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and unnecessary data removed:\n\nFor low-carbon heating, cooling, and transport, investments in renewable energy must be made over a long time horizon to maximize returns on investment for these long-life power generators. Over these long time horizons, multiple uncertainties exist, such as future electricity demand and costs to consumers and investors. To mitigate imperfect information about the future, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement learning approach to optimize for a low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply using a modified version of the FTT:Power model.\n\nWe model the UK and Ireland electricity markets. The DDPG algorithm learns the optimal electricity mix through experience and achieves this between 2017 and 2050.
