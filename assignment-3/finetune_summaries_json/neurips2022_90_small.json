Out of all sectors transportation is responsible for the largest share with 37% [ 1]. Efforts have been taken to reduce transportation-related emission levels including better roadways [2], optimizing traffic signals [ 7], electrical vehicles [ 20], among others. Emerging technologies like connected autonomous vehicles (CA Vs) provide a substantial opportunity in optimizing driving patterns [10, 14, 6] and traffic flow [21, 17], which, in turn, can significantly reduce CO 2emission. An integral requirement in assessing the impact of these interventions is the access to calibrated CO 2 emission models. Emerging learning-based interventions like eco-driving [ 6], inherently require programmatic and instantaneous emission models that can be used to define a reward function in training agents [ 6]. For an emission model to be programmatic, it should have an API or scripted-based queries and results can be returned quickly. In addition, instantaneous means being able to calculate the emissions for an action taken within a single time step. Similarly, modern control methods like trajectory optimizations [ 12] share similar requirements in formulating objective functions. In general, any roadway intervention that changes the underlying vehicular dynamics should be properly assessed for climate impact using carefully calibrated CO 2emission models under diverse conditions. Industry-standard CO 2emission models are neither instantaneous nor programmatic [ 16,3] and often limited to specific types of vehicles, one fuel type, and make simplifying assumptions such as zero road grades [ 8,4]. Such limitations significantly hinder the progress of research and could even advance the field in a vacuum due to the lack of realism and variety [5, 19]. In this paper, we address these limitations with the hope of facilitating future research in roadway interventions for tackling climate change. In particular, we introduce a spectrum of programmatic and instantaneous vehicular CO 2emission models that contains 1100 individual CO 2emission models *These authors contributed equally to this work. *To preserve the anonymity of the submission, an anonymized version of the released emission model data set is presented with this submission.

We use the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) [ 16] by the US Environmental Protection Agency as our emission data source and produce CO 2emission models by an isolation methodology, MOVES processing and function fitting. We validate the accuracy of our emission models by using MOVES as ground truth. We have publicly released our emission models as a dataset and hope future research in roadway interventions for tackling climate change will benefit from it. 2 Related Work A summary of related work is presented in Table 1.

However, it is neither instantaneous nor programmatic and has high computational overhead making it undesirable for modern learning-based roadway interventions.

Transportation is responsible for the largest share, accounting for 37% of global emissions. Efforts have been made to reduce transportation-related emissions, including improving roadways, optimizing traffic signals, and promoting the use of electric vehicles. Emerging technologies, such as connected autonomous vehicles, offer opportunities to optimize driving patterns and traffic flow, which can significantly reduce CO2 emissions.\n\nTo assess the impact of these interventions, calibrated CO2 emission models are essential. Learning-based interventions, such as eco-driving, require programmatic and instantaneous emission models that can be used to define a reward function in training agents. Modern control methods, like trajectory optimizations, also require similar models to formulate objective functions.\n\nHowever, industry-standard CO2 emission models are neither instantaneous nor programmatic and often have limitations, such as being specific to certain types of vehicles, fuel types, and road grades. These limitations hinder research progress and can lead to unrealistic and limited results. In this paper, we address these limitations by introducing a spectrum of programmatic and instantaneous vehicular CO2 emission models that account for various factors.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe use the Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES) as our emission data source and produce CO2 emission models using an isolation methodology, MOVES processing, and function fitting.
