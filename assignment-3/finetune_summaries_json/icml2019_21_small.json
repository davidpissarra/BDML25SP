Introduction The planetary energy balance (between incoming and out- going radiation), and hence global temperature, is very sen- sitive to the properties and distribution of clouds in the atmosphere. In turn, the properties of clouds depend on the availability of condensation nuclei in the form of aerosol (Lohmann et al., 2016). An increase in aerosol particles, due to human activity for example, generally enhances the number of small cloud droplets for a given amount of liquid water. Smaller droplets are more reﬂective and so increase the albedo of the cloud (Twomey, 1974).

These changes also affect the availability of aerosol, and clouds themselves change, remove, and even produce aerosol, creating complex feedbacks which are hard to disentangle. One approach to tackle this problem is by looking for strong local aerosol perturbations in otherwise clean environments, ideally with slowly varying cloud properties. Ship tracks - tracks of cloud made brighter than their surroundings by ship emissions, provide ideal cases (Christensen & Stephens, 2011). Finding and analysing these tracks is, however, a laborious and time-consuming process, and hence no global long-term databases of these important phenomena exist. Another, even less well understood, process by which changes in aerosol amount can change cloud properties is the so called lifetime effect. Cloud droplets will start to pre- cipitate once they reach a certain critical diameter, usually around 14 \u0016m. All other things being equal, a smaller distri- bution of cloud droplets can delay the onset of precipitation in a cloud, potentially enhancing its lifetime and fractional area (Albrecht, 1989). This acts to increase the albedo of the cloud further, potentially creating a large cooling effect (relative to the unperturbed cloud) (Boucher et al., 2013). Large continuous decks of stratocumulus (Sc) clouds occur in the cold upwelling regions of the major oceans and play a crucial role in the global energy balance because of their size and persistence. However, an important phenomena occurs where a large region of the cloud deck dissipates through the onset of precipitation and leaves open regions, so called Pockets of Open Cells (POCs) (Stevens et al., 2005). It has been hypothesized that these occurrences could be affected by anthropogenic activity, speciﬁcally through aerosol per- turbations delaying or even inhibiting their onset and caus- ing a large cooling effect through the mechanisms described above (Rosenfeld et al., 2006). Hence, POCs could have important implications for climate change. Again how- ever, besides from a handfull of small-scale case studies, no database of POC occurrence exists.
