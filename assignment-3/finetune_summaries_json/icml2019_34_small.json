Introduction In 2010, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) published a guidance regarding the disclosure re- quirements that companies must comply with relating to the issue of climate change (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2010). This guidance stipulated that com- panies issuing stocks traded on U.S. markets were legally obliged to disclose any risks and uncertainties related to climate change, be it its physical impacts on assets or dis- tribution chains, its legislative impacts on proﬁt generation, the international accords affecting prices of raw materials, and even indirect market consequences such as supply and demand (Doran & Quinn, 2008). While this is undoubtedly a step forward in transparency and accountability, the problem remains that SEC ﬁlings are hundreds of pages long and ﬁlled with ﬁnancial and legislative jargon, which makes it hard to pinpoint the pas- sages, if any, that address climate risk disclosures. In fact, a 2013 study found that of 3,895 U.S. public companies listed on major stock exchanges, only 27 percent mentioned cli- mate change explicitly in their annual reports (Hirji, 2013). However, this study utilized keyword search, which leaves 1Mila, University of Montreal, Canada2Element AI, Mon- treal, Canada. Correspondence to: Alexandra Luccioni <luccio- nis@mila.quebec >.

In our study, we aim to focus on a subset of ma- jor U.S. companies in order to analyze the extent to which these companies disclose climate risk, what they divulge, and how this evolves before and after the 2010 ruling. 2. Methodology We propose to bootstrap the process of analyzing climate disclosures by starting with a set of hand-picked keywords, then automatically expanding the vocabulary to be able to detect sections in the text that address climate risk. We then propose to extract information using state-of-the-art NLP tools from those sections focusing on targeted categories and concepts. This pipeline both streamlined and transparent to simplify human intervention for evaluation purposes and to guarantee the ownership of the analysis afterwards. For our analysis, we will focus on 10-K reports, which are publicly available documents that are published on the SEC website1and that give a comprehensive summary of a com- pany’s ﬁnancial performance on a yearly basis. While all companies traded on the stock market can (and eventually, will) be affected by climate change, we will start with com- panies from the S&P 500, the largest companies listed on the U.S. stock markets which represent about 80% of their total market value. We will focus more speciﬁcally on com- panies from sectors that are most obviously impacted by climate change: energy, real estate, oil and gas, utilities, and materials (Winn et al., 2011), for a total of 115 companies. We target the ten-year period between 2008 and 2018, to encompass a time frame before and since the SEC ruling. This will give us a total of 1150 documents to analyze. 2.1. Identifying Climate Disclosure Sections Despite the SEC ruling, it is probable that many companies simply do not explicitly include climate risk disclosures in their annual ﬁndings. Therefore the ﬁrst challenge of our work is ﬁnding the relevant sections within the disclosures that explicitly mention these risks. In order to identify these passages, we propose to start with a semi-supervised ap- 1https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtmlUsing NLP to Analyze Climate Disclosures proach, constructing a climate dictionary from a small set of seed words selected manually, then automatically expanding these seed words to build a full-ﬂedged vocabulary. The eight initial seed words that we propose in our approach are: biodiversity, carbon, climate, ecology, environment, emission, pollution, sustainable. Starting with this seed vocabulary, we propose to take each word and query a 300- dimensional word embedding model trained on Wikipedia and the Gigaword corpus (Pennington et al., 2014) to gen- erate one vector per word. We use each vector to retrieve the ten closest words using cosine similarity, expanding this initial list of 8 seed words into 50 climate-related words (since many of the related words overlap), which we can use to identify relevant passages in the 10-K reports. The ex- panded list of words includes terms like: CO2, deforestation\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This guidance mandated that companies issuing stocks on U.S. markets disclose any risks and uncertainties related to climate change, including physical impacts on assets and supply chains, legislative impacts on profit generation, international accords affecting raw material prices, and indirect market consequences such as supply and demand (Doran & Quinn, 2008). Although this was a step forward in transparency and accountability, the problem remains that SEC filings are lengthy and filled with financial and legislative jargon, making it difficult to pinpoint passages addressing climate risk disclosures. A 2013 study found that only 27% of 3,895 U.S. public companies listed on major stock exchanges mentioned climate change explicitly in their annual reports (Hirji, 2013).
