This Summary for Policymakers (SPM) presents the key findings of the Special Report, based on the assessment of the available  scientific, technical and socio-economic literature2 relevant to global warming of 1.5°C and for the comparison between global  warming of 1.5°C and 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The level of confidence associated with each key finding is reported using  the IPCC calibrated language.3 The underlying scientific basis of each key finding is indicated by references provided to chapter  elements. In the SPM, knowledge gaps are identified associated with the underlying chapters of the Report. A. Understanding Global Warming of 1.5°C4 A.1 Human activities are estimated to have caused approximately 1.0°C of global warming5 above  pre-industrial levels, with a likely range of 0.8°C to 1.2°C.
