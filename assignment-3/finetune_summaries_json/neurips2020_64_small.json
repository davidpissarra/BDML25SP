Precise irrigation data can help with monitoring water usage and optimizing agricultural yield, particularly in developing countries. Irrigation data, in tandem with precipitation data, can be used to predict water budgets as well as climate and weather modeling. With our research, we produce an irrigation prediction model that combines unsupervised clustering of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal signatures with a precipitation heuristic to label the months that irrigation peaks for each cropland cluster in a given year. We have developed a novel irrigation model and Python package (\"Irrigation30\") to generate 30m resolution irrigation predictions of cropland worldwide. With a small crowdsourced test set of cropland coordinates and irrigation labels, using a fraction of the resources used by the state-of-the-art NASA-funded GFSAD30 project with irrigation data limited to India and Australia, our model was able to achieve consistency scores in excess of 97% and an accuracy of 92% in a small geo-diverse randomly sampled test set. 1 Introduction Understanding global irrigation patterns, both the extent of cropland and water usage, can enable various climate science efforts. Irrigated cropland accounts for 70% of global freshwater use (R. Q. Grafton et al., 2018). As population growth continues, the cropland required to keep up with food demand will signiﬁcantly increase greenhouse gas productions (Tillman et al., 2011). This cropland demand will be particularly located in developing countries, where population and consumption growth are disproportionate. Furthermore, precise irrigation data enables various climate science applications like crop water productivity modeling (Deryng et al., 2016) and global biomass estimation (Mauser et al., 2015). To sustainably meet this existential challenge, a precise and accurate understanding of global irrigation usage is required. Despite the need for accurate global irrigation data, current data sources are outdated, low-resolution, and potentially inaccurate. With our research, we develop a machine learning model that estimates Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.irrigation at 30m resolution using the latest satellite and climate datasets in years 2017+. We also deliver a Python package1that allows researchers to make use of our irrigation model and generate irrigation predictions for small regions at a time. 2 Related Work Meier et al. (2018) created a global irrigation map at 30 arcsec (approx. 0.9km at the Equator) through downscaling a lower-resolution statistically-based global irrigation map and analyzing remote sensing data. However, the median crop ﬁeld size is far less than 1km2in the mainland United States (0.278km2), and even smaller in Asia and Africa (Yan et al., 2016; Fritz et al., 2015). To accurately measure the irrigation extent, a higher-resolution mapping is needed on a global scale. The Global Food Security-support Analysis Data @ 30-m (GFSAD30) project provides irrigation labels at 30m resolution, although these irrigation products are currently limited to a few regions and data is accessible by visualization only (i.e., no downloadable content).2An earlier effort from the GFSAD team generated ﬁve-class global cropland extent, which marked irrigation and rainfed extent at 1km resolution for nominal year 2010 (Thenkabail et al., 2016). Xie et al. (2019) used a semi-automatic training approach to map irrigated cropland extent across the conterminous United States at 30m resolution. At the time of writing, there are no publications that produce 30m resolution irrigation mappings on a global scale. 3 Research Methodology 3.1 Data Sources While many recent publications on irrigation detection used Landsat satellite data (Yan et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017; Oliphant et al., 2019; Gumma et al., 2020; Phalke et al., 2020), Sentinel-2 satellite data was chosen for this analysis because of its higher revisit frequency (a ﬁve-day revisit frequency over land surface as compared to 16-day revisit frequency for Landsat 8). The shorter revisit period of Sentinel-2 allows monthly time series data to be more representative and less inﬂuenced by factors that cause outliers like cloud coverage. Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument covers 13 bands at resolutions ranging from 10 to 60 meters. We use NDVI, the normalized difference between near-infrared band and red band, as a measure of cropland vegetation coverage and its healthiness. Climate data, such as precipitation, is also used in our analysis. TerraClimate provides global monthly climate data at 2.5 arc minutes, which is approx. 4.2km at the Equator (Abatzoglou et al., 2018).

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nOur research aims to address climate change by providing precise irrigation data. This data can help monitor water usage and optimize agricultural yield, particularly in developing countries. By combining irrigation data with precipitation data, we can predict water budgets and improve climate and weather modeling. We have developed a novel irrigation model that uses unsupervised clustering of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal signatures in conjunction with a precipitation heuristic to identify the months when irrigation peaks for each cropland cluster in a given year. Our model, implemented in the Python package \"Irrigation30,\" generates 30m resolution irrigation predictions for cropland worldwide.\n\nUsing a small crowdsourced test set of cropland coordinates and irrigation labels, our model achieved consistency scores exceeding 97% and an accuracy of 92% in a small, geo-diverse test set, outperforming the state-of-the-art NASA-funded GFSAD30 project, which focused on irrigation data in India and Australia.\n\nUnderstanding global irrigation patterns, including the extent of cropland and water usage, is crucial for various climate science efforts. Irrigated cropland accounts for 70% of global freshwater use (Grafton et al., 2018). As population growth continues, the demand for cropland to meet food needs will increase greenhouse gas emissions (Tillman et al., 2011). This demand will be particularly pronounced in developing countries, where population and consumption growth are disproportionate. Precise irrigation data enables applications such as crop water productivity modeling (Deryng et al., 2016) and global biomass estimation (Mauser et al., 2015).\n\nTo address this challenge, we require a precise and accurate understanding of global irrigation usage. However, current data sources are outdated, low-resolution, and potentially inaccurate. Our research develops a machine learning model that estimates irrigation at 30m resolution using the latest satellite and climate datasets from 2017 onwards. We also provide a Python package that allows researchers to utilize our irrigation model and generate irrigation predictions for small regions.\n\nPrevious studies have created global irrigation maps at lower resolutions (Meier et al., 2018) or focused on specific regions (Xie et al., 2019). However, these efforts have limitations, such as low resolution or limited geographic scope. The Global Food Security-support Analysis Data @ 30-m (GFSAD30) project provides irrigation labels at 30m resolution, but these products are currently limited to a few regions and are only accessible through visualization (no downloadable content). Our research aims to address these limitations by providing a global, high-resolution irrigation mapping.\n\nOur methodology involves using Sentinel-2 satellite data, which offers a higher revisit frequency than Landsat satellite data. We utilize the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a measure of cropland vegetation coverage and healthiness, and climate data, such as precipitation, to inform our analysis. TerraClimate provides global monthly climate data at 2.5 arc minutes, which is approximately 4.2km at the Equator (Abatzoglou et al., 2018)."
