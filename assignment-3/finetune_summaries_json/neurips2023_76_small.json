Large scale, high resolution data derived from these sensors can be used to inform intervention and policy decision making, but the timeliness and accuracy of these interventions is limited by use of optical data, which cannot operate at night and is affected by adverse weather conditions. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) offers a robust alternative to optical data, but its associated complexities limit the scope of labelled data generation for traditional deep learning. In this work, we apply a self-supervised pretrain- ing scheme, masked autoencoding, to SAR amplitude data covering 8.7% of the Earth’s land surface area, and tune the pretrained weights on two downstream tasks crucial to monitoring climate change - vegetation cover prediction and land cover classification. We show that the use of this pretraining scheme reduces labelling re- quirements for the downstream tasks by more than an order of magnitude, and that this pretraining generalises geographically, with the performance gain increasing when tuned downstream on regions outside the pretraining set. Our findings signifi- cantly advance climate change mitigation by facilitating the development of task and region-specific SAR models, allowing local communities and organizations to deploy tailored solutions for rapid, accurate monitoring of climate change effects. 1 Introduction Satellite remote sensing has fundamentally changed the way we address climate change, offering large scale, high resolution data for applications such as forest mapping [ 1][2], wildfire monitoring [ 3] and flood detection [ 4]. Data from such tasks is crucial to address problems caused by climate change, but is restricted by the limitations of optical sensing. The inability of these sensors to operate at night, through cloud cover and without atmospheric interference mean that optical data is inappropriate Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023for time sensitive tasks such as natural disaster management [ 4]. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) overcomes these limitations, providing more consistent, all-weather, day-night monitoring capabilities. These enhanced capabilities are invaluable for timely intervention in situations including extreme weather [ 5], natural disasters [ 6], rapid ecological shifts [ 7], and deforestation [ 8], all of which have implications for climate change. While SAR’s robust capabilities offer a promising avenue for overcoming the challenges associated with optical sensors, it comes with its own set of complexities. The technical demands associated with processing SAR data, including aspects like coherence estimation and interferogram formation, make it challenging to apply conventional machine learning techniques. Such hurdles limit the ease of generating labeled data for supervised learning, limiting SAR’s effectiveness in automated analysis. Self-supervised learning offers the advantage of learning directly from the input data without requiring ground truth labels. Methodologies such as those based on contrastive learning [ 9], masked image modelling [ 10] and knowledge distillation [ 11] have achieved remarkable successes on RGB image data, yielding significant improvements in various tasks such as image classification, segmentation, and object detection [ 12][13], reducing dependency on labelled data. Despite these advancements, the application of self-supervised learning to SAR data remains relatively unexplored [ 14]. Approaches based on data fusion with other remote sensing data sources such as RGB satellite or aerial imagery exist [ 15][16], but although these approaches can exploit the specifics of SAR data, they may not be robust to the absence of usable RGB data at night or under cloud cover. A small number of methods operating solely on SAR data exist [ 17][18][19], but have not yet clearly shown the geographic or temporal generalisabilty often lacking in remote sensing models [ 20]. Applying self-supervised learning directly to the large amounts of available unlabelled SAR data would allow practitioners to circumvent the limitations posed by the absence of reliable RGB data at night or in cloudy conditions - improving accuracy and response time in areas such as disaster management and environmental monitoring. Moreover, the use of large-scale, geographically diverse data with a model large enough to accommodate it has the potential to overcome the generalisability issues that often plague remote sensing models, presenting a robust alternative solely based on SAR data. In this work, we take a self-supervised pretraining scheme - masked autoencoding [ 10] - that has been proven effective on curated RGB imagery, and apply it to polarimetric SAR data on a large set of data covering 8.7% of the Earth’s land surface. We finetune the pretrained model on two downstream tasks - vegetation cover prediction (per-image regression) and land cover classification (semantic segmentation). We show that, in all cases, pretraining improved performance on downstream tasks. We also show that models initialized with pretrained weights still outperform their randomly initialized counterparts when using substantially fewer labels. We show that the pretrained model generalised well to regions that were not seen in the pretraining set. 2\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
