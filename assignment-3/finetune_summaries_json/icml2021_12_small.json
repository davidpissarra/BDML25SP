However, peatland ﬁres are unique among ﬁres and there- fore require datasets and architectures attuned to their particular characteristics. In this paper, we present a new dataset, PeatSet, designed speciﬁ- cally for the problem of peatland ﬁre prediction. In addition, we propose several models to tackle the problem of ﬁre prediction for the peatlands. We develop novel neural architectures for peat- land ﬁre prediction, PeatNet and PT-Net, with a graph-based and a transformer-based architec- ture, respectively.

Introduction Peatlands are a type of wetland that include marshes, bogs, fens, and swamps. They sequester more than twice as much carbon as stored in the world’s forests despite covering only 3% of the Earth’s land area (International Union for Conservation of Nature, 2017; Turetsky et al., 2015). Cli- mate change has exacerbated the magnitude and frequency of ﬁres and the length of the ﬁre season (Flannigan et al., 2009). Additionally, peat ﬁres release a large amount of the carbon sequestered in peatlands, emitting massive amounts *Equal contribution†The contributions in this paper were made prior to joining Amazon.1Carnegie Mellon University2Amazon.

The combination of anthropogenic cli- mate change and peat ﬁres form a positive feedback loop of peatland carbon emissions. Several features of peatland ﬁres differentiate them from commonly-explored forest ﬁre approaches. First, peat ﬁres produce less heat than typical ﬁres. Second, peat ﬁres can occur underground, in wet or cold areas, and even under snow as exempliﬁed by western Canadian peat ﬁres (Thomp- son, 2020). Third, peat ﬁres can last for months when they are smouldering underground, challenging the use of burn duration as a heuristic for ﬁre severity. Fourth, factors such as soil carbon and soil moisture are far more important for peatland ﬁres than forest ﬁres since the soil itself is a fuel source. Consequently, normal ﬁre prediction techniques are less effective on peatland ﬁres. Prior work on regular forest ﬁre and peatland ﬁre prediction do present baselines to test the suggested models against. Most notably, the current state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms for forest ﬁre prediction use convolutional neural networks (CNN) (Hodges et al., 2019; Radke et al., 2019).

(2016); Listy- orini and Rahim (2018) use a system of detectors near a speciﬁc peatland to predict ﬁre spread. Bourgeau-Chavez et al. (2020a) perform a review of four ﬁres in peatlands to determine how the type of a peatland affects its likelihood of burning (Bourgeau-Chavez et al., 2020b). Maulana et al.
