Reinforcement learning (RL) serves as a powerful tool for uncovering optimal adaptation strategies, determining how and where to deploy adaptation measures effectively, even under significant uncertainty. In this study, we leverage RL to identify the most effective timing and locations for implementing measures, aiming to reduce both direct and indirect impacts of flooding. Our framework integrates climate change projections of future rainfall events and floods, models city-wide motorized trips, and quantifies direct and indirect impacts on infrastructure and mobility. Preliminary results suggest that our RL-based approach can significantly enhance decision-making by prioritizing interventions in specific urban areas and identifying the optimal periods for their implementation. Our framework is publicly available: https://github.com/ MLSM-at-DTU/floods_transport_rl. 1 Introduction As climate change continues to impact our world, the frequency and intensity of high impact weather events are expected to rise [ 1]. In Denmark, extreme rainfall is projected to become more severe and occur more frequently [ 2]. As rainfall increases, so does the risk of urban pluvial flooding. Floods can significantly disrupt social and economic activities, including transportation, causing delays and loss of vehicle control [3]. To effectively address these challenges, cities must enhance their resilience. In this work, we address the challenge of identifying the most effective adaptation measures to minimize the impacts of pluvial floods on transportation. Using Copenhagen, Denmark, as our case study, we frame our problem using a reinforcement learning (RL) approach. We build an environment that incorporates current climate projections of rainfall and consequent floods. Concurrently, we model trips which are disrupted by varying water levels, affecting mobility and transport infrastructure. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive framework designed to identify the best adaptation measures for enhancing transportation resilience to urban floods using such approach. 1.1 Related Work Urban pluvial flooding occurs when large volumes of water accumulate in streets or roads due to insufficient drainage and infiltration capacity as a result of heavy precipitation events [ 4]. Transporta- Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2024tion is significantly impacted by such floods, both directly and indirectly [ 5]. These impacts include road deterioration [5], travel delays and congestion [6, 7], and loss of accessibility [8, 9]. RL has previously been applied to a few aspects of flood management and transportation. For instance, it has been used to design emergency routing systems [ 10], control urban drainage and stormwater systems [ 11,12], and study travel behaviors to inform response strategies [ 13]. However, these applications generally focus on reactive strategies – responding to events as they occur – rather than proactively determining the best adaptation measures to minimize future flood impacts. On the other hand, evaluating adaptation measures typically relies on expert knowledge or limited simulations, assessing how these measures can prevent or mitigate the impacts of floods [ 14,15, 16,17]. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no comprehensive study using reinforcement learning of how different adaptation measures should be implemented over time to proactively minimize both the direct and indirect impacts of floods on transportation. 2 Modelling Framework We frame our approach as an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) that connects: 1) a rainfall projection model, 2) a flood model, 3) a transportation model, and 4) a transport infrastructure and mobility impact model. Figure 1 provides an overview of our IAM framework, which we now detail.

For each time slice, we assumed stationarity and formed the associated cumulative density function (CDF). Based on the CDF we sampled one heavy rainfall event per year. Urban pluvial flooding is often caused by intense precipitation of short duration (cloudbursts, from minutes to a few hours), typically associated with warm and moist conditions. For simplicity and as proof-of-concept, we assumed the projected heavy rainfall intensity (amount of precipitation) to be equal to the accumulated daily rainfall. Jointly with the choice of climate scenario, the resulting CDF is likely to overestimate the rainfall intensities and therefore represent a worst-case scenario for our periodical estimates. 2.2 Flood Model After sampling a particular rainfall event\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
