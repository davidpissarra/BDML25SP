Thesmartgriddomainconsidersenergystoragesystems, cutting-edgetechnologies, distributed energy resources management, and automated demand response as promising solutions that can help optimize energy usage and reduce carbon emissions. However, the energy grid is a complex and interconnected system that suffers from the constantly changing scenarios brought by the random nature of renewable. Machine Learning seems to be a pivotal tool to address the complexities of the scenario mentioned above Rolnick et al. (2019). Still, real-life applications must address the gen- eralization of models and preservation of sensitive energy usage data. We propose an FL TRPO model. This framework harnesses inherent generalization capability and privacy guarantees from FL to discern latent relationships within the feature space. In conjunction with TRPO, strategically incorporating a purposefully designed model to leverage prior knowledge regarding the features, the FL TRPO model exhibits the robustness necessary to map from feature space to optimal policy outcomes effectively. •This research evaluates the performance of FL TRPO in the context of a smart grid problem, leveraging the faster convergence of TRPO with the fewer communication rounds time of FL. •FL generalize effectively to previously unseen datasets Han et al. (2022). We constructed training and testing datasets with different distributions to showcase this ability in the smart grid scenario. We incorporated intricate environmental relationships where the reward is a non-linear function of the features. 1•By exposing agents to varying training and testing data distributions, we conducted a comparative analysis of performance with and without FL. •Harnessing our prior understanding of the features, we engineered a model capable of computing optimal policies, thereby elevating the overall model performance. 2 Related Work Federated Learning. FL provides methods to train models across decentralized agents while keeping privacy. Federated Averaging (FedAvg) McMahan et al. (2017) stands as the pioneering framework in FL, where agents exchange weights after multiple updates on their respective local data. Researchers have enhanced FL by building upon the notion of training decentralized agents. Gossip algorithms ensure efficient communication Koloskova et al. (2019), split learning offers a method to achieve personalization Vepakomma et al. (2018), differential privacy ensures to safeguard privacy Geyer et al. (2017), novel computation and communication techniques have been developed to handle heterogeneous data Diao et al. (2021), and analysis generalization especially in FL Yuan et al. (2022). Benefiting from its ability to handle heterogeneous data training, preserving privacy, and generalization on unseen data, FL demonstrates promising performance in addressing challenges related to smart grid scenarios. Smart grids problem. Recently, the challenges within smart grid systems have garnered attention across academic and industrial spheres. Ceusters et al. (2021) devised a model- based reinforcement learning (RL) approach tailored to multi-energy systems, enhancing it with constrained optimization algorithms to derive optimal solutions. Meanwhile, Su et al. (2022) introduced a Federated RL (FRL) methodology, considering the dynamics between Energy Data Owners (EDOs) and Energy Service Providers (ESPs), addressing free-rider phenomena and non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data distribution nuances. In Rezazadeh and Bartzoudis (2022), this work was further enriched by harnessing a discretized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) framework within the FRL paradigm, leading to faster convergence and mitigating privacy breaches. Similarly, Lee and Choi (2022) leveraged FRL and demonstrated faster convergence and better performance than agents without FRL. Furthermore, Cuadrado et al. (2023a) introduced a hierarchical FRL architecture, yielding performance enhancements. Cuadrado et al. (2023b) presented a holistic framework for smart grid problems with three layers of different objectives. Despite these pivotal advances highlighting FRL’s potency in energy management difficulties, the focus has primarily centered on its operational efficacy. 3 Problem and Environment We based our environment setting on CityLearn Vázquez-Canteli et al.
