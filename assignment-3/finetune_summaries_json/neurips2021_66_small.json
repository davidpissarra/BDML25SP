Compared to existing battery modeling efforts, we aim to build a model with physics as its backbone and statistical learning techniques as enhancements. Such a hybrid model has better generalizability and interpretability together with a well- calibrated uncertainty associated with its prediction, rendering it more valuable and relevant to safety-critical applications under realistic usage scenarios. 1 Lithium-ion batteries, electriﬁcation and climate change By reducing greenhouse gas emissions to mitigate climate change, electriﬁcation plays an essential role in distributed energy consumption, such as electric vehicles, and in centralized power grid supply, where energy storage facilities are needed to mediate the mismatch between load requirements and intermittent renewable energy sources such as sunlight, wind, and tide. In such applications, rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) [ 1] are an increasingly pivotal technology for energy storage and conversion. Therefore, much effort has been devoted in the past decades towards LIB materials development and design improvement [2, 3], modeling [4], and real-time control [5]. A common key aspect underlying these endeavors is understanding, detecting, and predicting battery degradation [ 6], of which the effectiveness will directly impact the performance, durability, safety, and cost of LIBs. In this project, we propose the approach of hybrid physics-based and data-driven modeling for online diagnosis and prognosis, by which we mean estimation of battery state of health (SOH) and prediction of remaining useful life (RUL), respectively, under typical usage patterns. We would like to emphasize two main threads of model development. First, we want to minimize reliance on historical usage data in diagnosis and prognosis, which will enhance the applicability and practicality of the approach. Second, we make heavy use of known physical knowledge of both charge/discharge cycling and degradation to reduce the amount of training data required, and increase the generalizability as well as interpretability of the modeling approach. 2 Gaps in past research on battery degradation prediction We ﬁrst categorize current methodologies for SOH estimation, RUL prediction and degradation prognosis along three main dimensions, all of which affect their relevance to practical usage scenarios, and then review where various lines of past research lie in this landscape. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.The ﬁrst dimension is whether the cycling history of a battery cell is required. For example, the linear regression model by Severson et al. [ 7] requires the discharge curves of the ﬁrst 100 cycles for each cell, which prohibits its generalization and application to a cell at an unknown aging stage. The second dimension regards whether degradation dynamics is explicitly modeled. Most purely data-driven SOH predictions take an end-to-end approach, mapping from past usage [ 7,8] or current state directly to RUL. In contrast, some researchers attempt to relate incremental capacity fade to the cell state and usage within a short interval empirically using machine learning (ML) [ 9]. Such a dynamical model can then be used to project future degradation and RUL under typical usage patterns. The latter approach typically better utilizes the underlying dynamical structure of the system, yields richer information to be validated, and more readily adapts to an online estimation setting. The third dimension concerns how much prior physical knowledge is explicitly adopted for SOH prognosis [ 9]. The prediction models that use minimal physical knowledge are those purely based on supervised ML and agnostic of any physical principles, which ﬁt a speciﬁed function approximator, such as a linear regressor or a random forest, to a set of input-output data by optimization and inference. For prognosis, the input usually consists of time series of charge, voltage, current and temperature characterizing the usage history, while the output is RUL. Some researchers attempt to map these raw time series directly to RUL using fully connected or convolutional neural networks [ 8], while others leverage physical knowledge about degradation patterns to engineer some features manually before feeding them to more conventional algorithms for variable selection and parameter ﬁtting [ 7,10]. Some sequence-based models such as recurrent and long-short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks are promising for utilizing the raw time-series cycling data available, but their effectiveness remains to be proven on ﬁeld data. Overall, statistical learning theory dictates that the performance of purely data-driven models will likely deteriorate on unseen data that are distributed differently from training data, which is already manifested in the overﬁtting exhibited by some of the more complex models [ 8]. Due to scarcity of laboratory cycling data and noise in ﬁeld data, this weakness severely limits such models’ applicability to more realistic cell usage. Lying between purely empirical and physical models is the family of equivalent circuit models (ECMs). An ECM uses an electrical circuit with components of resistors, capacitors, inductors, and voltage sources to mimic the electrical response of a cell to external loads, without explicitly modeling the underlying reactions and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
