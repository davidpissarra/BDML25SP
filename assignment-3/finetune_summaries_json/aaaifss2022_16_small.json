In this work we review pre- vious applications of machine learning and statistical com- puting to polar climate research, and we highlight promising probabilistic machine learning methods that address the mod- elling needs of climate-related research in the Arctic and the Antarctic. We discuss common challenges in this interdisci- plinary field and provide an overview of opportunities for fu- ture work in this novel area of research. Introduction and Background This section introduces and defines the Polar Earth and Climate Science domain and substantiates the urgent need for continuing research in this field, most importantly to inform policy and decision-making based on a scientific, uncertainty-aware foundation. Next, we give a brief back- ground on the recent growth in machine learning (ML) to address Climate Change, propelled by an increase in data availability, the simultaneous leaps in computing power, and advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning methods. We motivate the emphasis on using a probabilistic framework to convey uncertainty modelling needs. With this uncertainty-aware perspective, this paper con- tributes a review of important machine learning applications in the polar parts of the Earth and Climate Science domain, thus building on the wider work of Rolnick et al. (2019). We discuss methodological aspects and the types of do- main problems addressed in previous work to then synthe- sise common challenges. We introduce suitable probabilistic machine learning methods, particularly Bayesian Optimisa- tion and causal methods, and highlight novel research from these areas where we recognise strong opportunities for fu- ture work in polar climate applications.

Pro- jections from a framework of state-of-the-art physics-based climate simulation models, CMIP6 (the acronym for Cou- pled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6) (Eyring et al. 2016), predict that the Arctic ocean will become largely free of sea ice during summer months by 2050, even under op- timistic anthropogenic emission scenarios (Notz and Com- munity 2020). Contributions from ice sheets and glaciers, notably the Greenland Ice sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are understood to be the dominant source of the rise in sea level (IPCC 2019). This poses a direct threat to the liveli- hoods of a large number of people who live on low-lying is- lands, in coastal regions but also in inland, flood prone areas. These and other concerning changes like ocean acidifica- tion resulting from absorption of anthropogenic CO2 emis- sions, ocean warming (IPCC 2019), or the acceleration in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Shi et al. 2021) highlight the critical role the polar regions hold in the context of the climate system: The cryosphere, describing all frozen water part of the Earth system, as well as the neighboring oceans, are strongly linked to other components of the global climate system through the exchange of carbon, water and energy (IPCC 2019).

While the global average temperature is warming, temperatures in the Arctic have increased by more than double the global mean over the last two decades (IPCC 2019). Projections from state-of-the-art physics-based climate simulation models, CMIP6 (Eyring et al. 2016), predict that the Arctic ocean will become largely free of sea ice during summer months by 2050, even under optimistic anthropogenic emission scenarios (Notz and Community 2020). Contributions from ice sheets and glaciers, notably the Greenland Ice Sheet and the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, are the dominant source of the rise in sea level (IPCC 2019). This poses a direct threat to the livelihoods of a large number of people who live on low-lying islands, in coastal regions, and in inland, flood-prone areas.\n\nThese changes, including ocean acidification resulting from anthropogenic CO2 emissions, ocean warming (IPCC 2019), and the acceleration of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (Shi et al. 2021), highlight the critical role the polar regions play in the climate system. The cryosphere, which includes all frozen water parts of the Earth system, and the neighboring oceans, are strongly linked to other components of the global climate system through the exchange of carbon, water, and energy (IPCC 2019).\n\nAccelerated by the recent pace of change and the looming threats to livelihoods and ecosystems, there are strong academic efforts to further our understanding of the field.

By analyzing air bubbles trapped in the ice up to a million years ago, they gain insights into the past. This shows how discoveries in the Earth Sciences often seed new insights for Climate Science. The problem of mapping the bedrock topography of Antarctica demonstrates how these fields are intertwined. This geology and Earth Sciences problem is directly related to the estimation of the ice topography and ice mass quantities that climate scientists are highly concerned with (Lythe and others)."
