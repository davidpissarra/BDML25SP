We investigate tempo- ral effects of wind speed related processes such as wakes within the wind farm using the Heterogeneous Graphical Granger model.

This splitting in scenarios allows us to carry out causal reasoning about possible causes of extreme wind speed in a wind farm. The discovered set of causal parameters for each of the scenarios provides infor- mation enabling future early warning as well as for taking management measures for wind farm power generation management under adverse weather conditions. 1 I NTRODUCTION Recent years have shown a rapid increase in renewable energy generation, especially with the energy crisis in the past years as well as with the aim of being fossil free in terms of energy generation by latest 2040.

It considers time series xi that follow a distribution from the exponential family using a canonical parameter θi. The generic density form for each xi can be written as p(xi|XLag t,d,θi) = h(xi) exp(xiθi−ηi(θi)), where XLag t,d = (xt−d 1,.., xt−1 1,.., xt−d p,.., xt−1 p), θi = XLag t,d(β∗ i)′, with β∗ i being the optimum, and ηi a link function corresponding to time series xi.\n\nThe HGGM applies the generalized linear models to time series in the following form:\nxt i≈µt i=ηt i(XLag t,dβ′ i) = ηt i(pX j=1dX l=1xt−l jβl j) (1)\nµi denotes the mean of xi, and ηt i is the t-th coordinate of ηi.
