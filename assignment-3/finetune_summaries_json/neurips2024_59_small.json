To this end, we propose the CanadaFire2023 dataset, which includes burned area mapping data collected from multiple satellite platforms, namely, Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2, specifically focused on these wildfires in the recorded history of Canada. To our knowledge, this is the first dataset specifically focused on burned area detection related to the unprecedented 2023 Canadian wildfires, using individual satellite imagery. We also trained four deep learning models—FCN, U-Net, multiscale ResNet, and SegFormer—for burned area mapping and evaluated the mapping performance using binary segmentation metrics, demonstrating that these datasets can serve as benchmarks for the research community studying wildfires and their environmental consequences. The CanadaFire2023 dataset could facilitate down- stream applications such as disaster management, carbon emission estimation, and climate change mitigation. 1 Introduction Canada possesses about 28% of the world’s boreal forest and roughly 25% of its peatlands, thereby storing a significant amount of carbon across various biomes in North America. Over the past six decades, burned areas from wildfires have doubled in Canada due to global warming and climate change [ 9], and this trend poses a threat to the carbon sink of aboveground biomass and organic soils, [13]. The 2023 Canadian wildfires, partially driven by early snow-melt and abnormal drought, [ 8] are unparalleled in terms of burned areas and climate impacts. This event has attracted significant attention from governments, society, and academia, emphasizing the need for wildfire monitoring, disaster management, and climate change mitigation. However, few datasets are available for burned area mapping, which is the foundation for climate analysis caused by wildfires. This motivates us to answer two questions: How can we create burned area mapping datasets from different Earth observation platforms? How can we establish machine learning benchmarks for the task of burned area detection? As a result of increasing temperatures and climate change in recent years, wildfires have become more prevalent all over the world, leading to the development of multiple wildfire-related datasets to support the understanding and analysis of this natural disaster [ 11,6,2]. For example, Ribeiro et al. created a novel dataset collected by a UA V and trained a 3D U-Net model for segmenting wildfire-burned areas. 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).Figure 1: Framework for creating the CanadaFire2023 datasets. The workflow involves: (i) generating burned area annotations and (ii) recording semantic segmentation metrics (such as precision, recall, and F1-score) for deep learning benchmarks across three satellite imagery datasets. A large-scale Mediterranean wildfire modeling dataset with a spatial resolution of 1 km, covering the period from 2006 to 2022, has been released for two purposes: wildfire danger forecasting and burned area estimation [ 6]. Gerard et al. present a multi-temporal U.S. dataset from 2018 to 2021 that focuses on active wildfire spreading, utilizing its unique time series structure [ 2]. Similar to our dataset, an Indonesian burned area mapping dataset of Landsat-8 satellite images is introduced, and a U-Net model is trained on it to detect burned areas [ 10]. Although these datasets all focus on wildfires or burned area mapping, our CanadaFire2023 dataset differs in three ways. First, to the best of our knowledge, CanadaFire2023 is the first dataset comprising individual imagery collected by three satellite-mounted sensors, specifically focused on the 2023 Canadian wildfires, which had substantial environmental and climate impacts. Second, CanadaFire2023 contains not just one but three datasets collected from three different satellite sensors, respectively. Lastly, CanadaFire2023 has a much higher spatial resolution than existing burned area mapping datasets. Specifically, the Landsat-8 and Landsat-9 datasets have a resolution of 30 meters, while the Sentinel-2 dataset has a resolution of 10 meters. Recent years have witnessed progress in the task of burned area mapping with the rapid application of machine learning models in remote sensing and environmental tasks [ 1,15,3]. In 2015, Alonso-Canas et al. proposed a global burned area detection algorithm using MERIS imagery and MODIS active fire data from 2006 to 2008. Later, Hawbaker et al. developed an automated method to detect burned areas on Landsat imagery for the conterminous U.S. [ 3]. More recently, Zanetti et al. put forward a burn severity index thresholding approach using multispectral satellite imagery for burned area mapping. Inspired by this pioneering work, we aim to first build a burned area mapping dataset focusing on the 2023 wildfires in Canada using satellite imagery from three multispectral platforms (Landsat-8, Landsat-9, and Sentinel-2\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
