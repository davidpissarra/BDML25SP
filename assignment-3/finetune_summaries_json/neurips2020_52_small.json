There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing parts of these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However, DINEOF is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters, reliant on temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential reconstruction. We propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a data using a Variational Autoencoder (V AE). Our accuracy results to date are competitive with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the beneﬁts of our method including vastly decreased computation time and ability to generate multiple po- tential reconstructions. Lastly, we outline our planned improvements and future work. 1 Introduction Phytoplankton and ocean colour are considered “Essential Climate Variables\" for measuring and predicting climate systems and ocean health [3]. Measuring phytoplankton and ocean colour is cost effective on a global scale as well as relevant to climate models. Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) is a commonly used metric to estimate phytoplankton levels (measured in units of mg=m3) and can be derived from ocean colour [1]. Additionally, Chl-a can also be used to detect harmful algae blooms which can be fatal to marine life [11]. As climate change progresses harmful algae blooms will increase in frequency. An increase of 2\u000eC in sea temperature will double the window of opprtunity for Harmful Algae Blooms in the Puget Sound [9]. Several different satellites provide Chl-a measurements but the Sentinel-3 mission1will be the focus of this paper. One of the biggest problems faced when using these measurements is the loss of spatial data due to clouds, sunglint or various other factors which can affect the atmospheric correction process [11]. Various algorithms exist to reconstruct the missing data with the most effective being those based off of extracting Empirical Orthographic Functions (EOF) from the data [12]. The most accurate and commonly used of these algorithms is Data INterpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) which iteratively calculate EOFs based on the input data [5, 12]. DINEOF is fairly slow [12] and performs poorly in more temporally homogenous waters such as a river mouth [5]. 1https://sentinel.esa.int/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-3 Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Machine learning has also been successful in reconstructing Chl-a data. Park et al. use a tree based model to reconstruct algae in polar regions [10]. This method is effective but requires knowledge of the domain to properly tune it. This makes it much less generalizable and therefore less effective than DINEOF as DINEOF works with no a priori knowledge. DINCAE is a very new machine learning approach to reconstructing data [2], which has also been shown to work on Chl-a [4]. DINCAE is accurate, but shares a drawback with DINEOF in that it can only generate a single possible reconstruction. Being able to see multiple potential reconstructions and potentially select a better one based on data that may not be able to be easily or quickly incorporated into the model. For example if we had Chl-a concentrations manually measured from missing areas, we could then generate reconstructions until we ﬁnd one that better matches the measured values. This would be much faster than changing DINCAE or DINEOF to incorporate the new data. The approach we outline in this paper is based on the Variational Autoencoder (V AE) from Kingma et al. [8] as well as Attribute2Image’s improvements in making generated images less random [13]. The dimensionality reduction in a V AE is somewhat similar to the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) used in DINEOF. The potential to leverage performance improvements using quantum annealing machines with V AEs was another motivation. [7]. In this paper we apply a model similar to Attribute2Image as well as Ivanov et al’s inpainting model to Chl-a data from the Salish Sea area surrounding Vancouver Island [6, 13]. We compare it to the industry standard DINEOF using experiments modeled after Hilborn et al.’s experiments [5]. This area was chosen as it contains both areas of high and low temporal homogeneity in terms of algae concentrations, which was determined by Hilborn et al to be something DINEOF is sensitive to [5]. 2 Method 2.1 Dataset and Preprocessing The dataset we use comes from the Algae Explorer Project2. This project used 1566 images taken daily from 2016-04-25 to 2020-09-30. For our experiments we use a 250x250 pixel slice from each day to create a 1566x250x250 dataset.
