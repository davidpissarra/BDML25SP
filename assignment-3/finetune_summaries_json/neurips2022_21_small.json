This work demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models, a form of deep generative models, for generating much more cheaply realistic high resolution rainfall samples for the UK conditioned on data from a low resolution simulation. We show for the first time a machine learning model that is able to produce realistic samples of high-resolution rainfall based on a physical model that resolves atmospheric convection, a key process behind extreme rainfall. By adding self-learnt, location-specific information to low resolution relative vorticity, quantiles and time-mean of the samples match well their counterparts from the high-resolution simulation. 1 Introduction Climate change is predicted to cause intensification of heavy rainfall extremes in the UK [1], [2]. Understanding rainfall at a local ( ∼2km) scale is important for better adapting to these changes - for example, to predict where flooding might occur, [3]. Machine learning (ML) techniques can emulate high-resolution simulations using low-resolution inputs to generate local projections [4], [5]. This means expensive projections from a climate model could be complemented with further, cheaper samples with realistic spatial and temporal structure enabling better understanding of the uncertainty of high-resolution precipitation. This is particularly useful for extreme events which are poorly sampled by high-resolution simulations due to their infrequent nature. Numerical simulations of physical processes of the climate can be used to create projections of rainfall but they are extremely expensive leading to trade-offs. At one end of the scale are global climate models (GCMs). These produce global-covering projections. Many variants exist with large ensemble sizes which allow experimenting with different scenarios and uncertainty in the underlying physics and model. The trade-off is these models restrict their resolution to grids of 25km or more, which is too coarse to provide actionable insight [6]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.At the other end of the simulation scale are dynamical downscaling models like the Met Office used to produce 2.2km local projections in their UKCP18 dataset [7]. These used a convection- permitting model (CPM), a specialised type of regional climate model (RCM), which had a fine enough resolution to produce local-scale projections that are useful to decision makers. The trade-off is a small ensemble size (12, all following a single climate change scenario following a single climate change scenario, SSP5-8.5) with reduced spatial and temporal domain (UK and Ireland for 60 years) [2]. An alternative approach to produce high resolution projections is called statistical downscaling. This approach attempts to fit a statistical relationship between a lower-resolution set of climate variables and higher-resolution values. They are much less computationally expensive than the dynamical downscaling approach of RCMs. Many approaches have been tried based on both traditional statistics and machine learning. No method has proven better than the others in general [4], [6], [8]. Gutiérrez et al. [6] assess the skill of 45 different methods for precipitation alone for a single European collaborative experiment, though the better-performing methods relevant to this project’s problem are mainly based on generalized linear models (GLMs) or nearest neighbours (methods of analogs). These only covered point-statistics at individual observation stations and cannot produce the full spatial structure of a rain field. Doury et al. [5] use U-Net [9] as the basis for their emulation of a 12km RCM based on GCM inputs over parts of France and Spain. Vandal et al. [4] found no clear best option when comparing traditional approaches with some off-the-shelf machine learning approaches (Multi-task Sparse Structure Learning and Autoencoder Neural Networks) for daily and extreme precipitation over the Northeastern United States. These systems are deterministic: once trained, the same conditioning GCM input will produce the high-resolution output. Without a probabilistic element, these models struggle to predict the small-scale detail of precipitation [10]. This work uses diffusion models [11]–[13] (aka score-based generative models), a recent development in deep generative models, to solve these problems with statistical downscaling. Statistical downscaling of the full grid (rather than just a selection of observation stations) can be considered as similar to the super-resolution problem of natural images. The grid squares of the GCM and CPM outputs are like pixels with their intensity corresponding to climate variables such as daily rainfall (albeit not just integer values between 0 and 255). Common approaches for state-of-the-art sample generation, probability density estimation and super-resolution of natural images rely on deep generative models: diffusion models, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) [14], Variational Autoencoders (V AEs) [15], and autoregressive (AR) models like PixelRNN [16]. Diffusion models have shown competitive results in the natural image domain [17] and offer desirable trade-offs in sample sharpness (V AEs tend to produce blurry samples) and sample diversity\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This work demonstrates the effectiveness of diffusion models, a type of deep generative model, for generating realistic high-resolution rainfall samples for the UK at a lower computational cost. We show for the first time a machine learning model that can produce realistic samples of high-resolution rainfall based on a physical model that resolves atmospheric convection, a key process behind extreme rainfall.

Understanding rainfall at a local scale (approximately 2km) is crucial for adapting to these changes, such as predicting where flooding might occur. Machine learning techniques can emulate high-resolution simulations using low-resolution inputs to generate local projections, complementing expensive projections from climate models with cheaper, more realistic samples that enable better understanding of the uncertainty of high-resolution precipitation. This is particularly useful for extreme events, which are poorly sampled by high-resolution simulations due to their infrequent nature.\n\nNumerical simulations of physical climate processes can create rainfall projections, but they are extremely expensive, leading to trade-offs.
