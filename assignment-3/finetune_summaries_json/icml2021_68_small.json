Finally, we discuss poten- tial applications for improving ocean and climate models. 1. Motivation and background Exchanges between oceans and the atmosphere involve ﬁf- teen times as much carbon as human activities emit by burn- ing fossil fuels, and are crucial in regulating temperature of the planet (Cavaleri et al., 2012). As water waves serve as a boundary between the ocean and the atmosphere, the understanding of wave processes is key to better model our changing climate. In particular, wave breaking governs many of the physical processes from air-sea momentum to gas and heat ﬂuxes (Sullivan et al., 2007; Fairall et al., 2011). It was also shown to signiﬁcantly increase albedo and aerosol concentrations (through generation of whitecaps and sea spray), the key variables in climate models (Lewis et al., 2004; Frouin et al., 2001). As waves break, they entrain air in the water column lead- ing to the formation of foam patches known as whitecaps. Analysis of wave breaking statistics is usually conducted by 1Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Califor- nia, San Diego, USA2Department of Engineering, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at ICML 2021analyzing percentage of whitecap coverage of sea surface (e.g. Callaghan & White, 2009). While this approach was used to determine some of the relevant properties (e.g. en- ergy dissipation rate), it does not provide information on the properties of breaking kinematics. In (Phillips, 1985), wave breaking statistics are analyzed in terms of distribution of length of actively breaking waves per unit of the sea sur- face area, \u0003(cb), where cbrepresents speed of the actively breaking waves. The main advantage of this approach is that moments of the \u0003(cb)distribution are related to many of the important physical quantities. Whitecap coverage is in fact a function of the ﬁrst moment of the distribution, and many other properties (breaking induced drift, momentum ﬂuxes, and energy dissipation) can be derived from it. Wave breaking is by nature temporally and spatially vari- able, and is especially difﬁcult to observe and characterize. While the Phillips (1985) theory was established decades ago, it is only in relatively recent years that \u0003distribu- tions were computed from high resolution airborne imagery (Kleiss & Melville, 2010). Collected georeferenced images of the ocean surface are ﬁrst gridded into a Cartesian coordi- nate system, pixels with brightness above certain threshold are classiﬁed as whitecaps (Kleiss & Melville, 2011), and whitecap kinematics are determined using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and/or optical ﬂow methods. An issue with this approach is that it can be difﬁcult (depending on the lighting conditions) to differentiate between sunglint and whitecaps, which can contaminate the results. Expected contributions In order to overcome this issue and to further the understanding of the role of wave break- ing in air-sea interaction processes, here we propose a data driven approach that makes use of the recent development of deep learning techniques for computer vision. Sunglint and whitecaps have different spatial and temporal struc- tures, which could be identiﬁed through neural network approaches. These techniques have been shown to outper- form traditional approaches in other vision-based tasks (e.g. for autonomous vehicles Grigorescu et al., 2020). Due to its ability to classify objects at pixel resolution with great accuracy, the use of UNet model (Ronneberger et al., 2015) is proposed in this work.Data driven approach for ﬁltering sunglint 2.

This work aims to improve ocean and climate models. \n\n1. Motivation and Background\n\nExchanges between oceans and the atmosphere involve fifteen times as much carbon as human activities emit by burning fossil fuels, and are crucial in regulating the planet's temperature (Cavaleri et al., 2012). Understanding wave processes is key to better modeling our changing climate. Wave breaking governs many physical processes, including air-sea momentum, gas, and heat fluxes (Sullivan et al., 2007; Fairall et al., 2011). It also significantly increases albedo and aerosol concentrations, which are key variables in climate models (Lewis et al., 2004; Frouin et al., 2001). As waves break, they entrain air in the water column, leading to the formation of foam patches known as whitecaps. Analysis of wave breaking statistics typically involves analyzing the percentage of whitecap coverage of the sea surface (e.g., Callaghan & White, 2009). However, this approach does not provide information on the properties of breaking kinematics.\n\nIn (Phillips, 1985), wave breaking statistics were analyzed in terms of the distribution of the length of actively breaking waves per unit of sea surface area, denoted as \u0003(cb), where cb represents the speed of actively breaking waves. The main advantage of this approach is that moments of the \u0003(cb) distribution are related to many important physical quantities. Whitecap coverage is a function of the first moment of the distribution, and other properties, such as breaking-induced drift, momentum fluxes, and energy dissipation, can be derived from it.\n\nWave breaking is temporally and spatially variable, making it difficult to observe and characterize.
