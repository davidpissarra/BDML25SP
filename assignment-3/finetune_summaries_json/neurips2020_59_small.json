We test two super-resolution models: the enhanced super-resolution genera- tive adversarial networks (ESRGAN) proposed in 2017, and the content adaptive resampler (CAR) proposed in 2020. Both models outperform simple bicubic inter- polation, with the ESRGAN exceeding expectations for accuracy. We make several proposals for extending the work to ensure it can be useful tool for quantifying the impact of climate change on local ecosystems while removing reliance on energy-intensive, high-resolution weather model simulations. 1 Introduction Weather prediction at a high spatial resolution is valuable and often essential for many applications including ﬂood prediction and water management, renewable energy production, and wildﬁre fore- casting. However, its production using traditional approaches (e.g., numerical weather prediction models) is computationally expensive. Recently, researchers have been exploring the use of machine learning techniques to downscale coarser resolution weather and climate simulations to ﬁner resolu- tion grids. Broadly speaking, four machine learning methods for have been described in the literature: Regression based methods, analog methods, auto-regression methods, and deep neural network super resolution based methods (e.g., Larraondo et al. [2017], Mouatadid et al. [2017], Coulibaly et al. [2005], He et al. [2016], Rodrigues et al. [2018], Bano-Medina et al. [2018], Rebora et al. [2006]. The latter method encompasses convolutional and generative adversarial neural networks for super resolution. The motivation for this work stems from The Jefferson Project at Lake George, a multiyear research initiative based at Lake George, New York, USA that has a goal of understanding the impact of human activity on fresh water, and how to mitigate those effects. A recent discovery (see Auger et al. [Submitted]) is that hydrodynamic simulations of Lake George are considerably more accurate when forced with high-resolution weather model data (<1 km horizontal resolution). A particularly striking result is that after one month of simulation, the hypolimnetic volume of the lake reduces by 15% when forced with weather information generated at 0.33 km resolution – in line with observations – compared to 3 km. In other words, the livable zone for cold-water ﬁsh reduces by 15%, which has signiﬁcant implications for understanding the impact of a warming climate on lake biological activity. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.Given the apparent importance of high-resolution weather data to accurately model the long-term changes of mid- and small-sized lakes, and given the exorbitant computational expense (and carbon footprint) of generating such high-resolution simulations with a physics-based weather model, we hereby examine the feasibility of using two super-resolution models to generate high-resolution inputs from coarse resolution weather model data. We strive for a resolution increase of up to 9x, more than most recent ML-based downscaling studies (e.g., Manepalli et al. [2020]). Successful implementation will have far-reaching consequences for improving our understanding of local weather impacts at climatic scales on vulnerable ecosystems and reduce the energy consumption of running high-resolution weather models. This manuscript presents early results for precipitation only, although other weather variables (wind, downward radiation, humidity) are equally important for coupling with hydrodynamic simulations. It builds on previous attempts at downscaling using tree-based regression models trained at every grid cell (Watson and Lynar [2020]), which were found to be inferior to super-resolution algorithms. 2 Data and Methods All precipitation data used in this study was generated by version 3.8.1 of the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model (Skamarock and Coauthors [2008]). Daily, operational weather forecasts for Lake George have been performed for Lake George with four (one-way coupled) domains with horizontal resolutions of 9 km, 3 km, 1 km and 0.33 km (Fig. 1). Each domain has 42 vertical levels (with 14 below 1 km), a 50-hPa model top, and a 5 km-deep upper-level absorbing layer. Further details can be found in Auger et al. [Submitted].
