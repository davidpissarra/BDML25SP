Introduction   Extreme weather events pose an enormous and               increasing threat to the nation’s electric power systems                 and the associated socio-economic systems that             depend on reliable delivery of electric power. The US                   Department of Energy reported in 2015, almost a                 quarter of unplanned grid outages were caused by                 extreme weather events and variability in             environment. Because climate change increases the             frequency and severity of extreme weather events,               communities everywhere will need to take steps to                 better prepare for, and if possible prevent, major                 outages ​. ​ While utilities have software tools available               to help plan their daily and future operations, these                   tools do not include capabilities to help them plan for                     and recover from extreme events. Software for               resilient design and recovery is not available               commercially and research efforts in this area are                 preliminary. In this project, we are developing and                 deploying a suite of novel software tools to anticipate,                   absorb and recover from extreme events. The tools                 will be integrated into an extensible and open                 platform, aiding future efforts in this area, and will                   include technology built with the unique capabilities               of SLAC, LBNL, GoogleX, NRECA, Packetized             Energy, Presence PG, and additional utility partners.               This research will aid the DOE OE and EERE                   Resilient Distribution Grid R&D mission of             developing cutting-edge resiliency technologies that           are deployed to utilities and reducing outage costs to                   meet the MYPP goal and DOE major outcome of a                     10% reduction in the economic costs of power outages                   by 2025. According to the DoE, the national cost of                     power outages in 2012 in the US, the year of                     Superstorm Sandy, was between $27 to $52 billion.                 Working towards a resilient grid is not just a matter of                       energy security, but also of economic security.     The goal of this project is to respond to grid events by:   1. Demonstrating machine learning and         artificial intelligence from different data           sources to ​ anticipate ​ grid events due to               extreme weather and distribution system           events;     2. Validating controls for distributed energy           resources for ​ absorbing grid events by riding               through with controllable loads; and   3. Reducing ​ recovery time by managing           distributed energy resources in the case of               cyber attacks that impact communications.       The project builds on previous efforts to collect                 massive amounts of smart meter, SCADA, solar               generation, electric vehicle charging, satellite imagery             and weather data collection and use them to fine-tune                   grid operations, including SLAC’s Visualization and             Analytics with high Penetration of Distributed Energy               Resources (VADER) project as well as other Grid                 Modernization Lab Consortium projects on distributed             controls and cyber security.     The innovations in the project include the application                 of artificial intelligence and machine learning for               distribution grid resilience, specifically, by using             predictive analytics, image recognition and           classification, and increased learning and problem             solving capabilities for anticipation of grid events. The                 project team will also demonstrate distributed control               theory with and without communications to absorb               and recover from grid events in Year 3.
