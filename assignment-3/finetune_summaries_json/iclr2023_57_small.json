However, there remain significant knowl- edge gaps about the distribution of species, due principally to the amount of effort and expertise required for traditional field monitoring. We propose an approach leveraging computer vision to improve species distribution modelling, combining the wide availability of remote sensing data with sparse on-ground citizen sci- ence data.We introduce a novel task and dataset for mapping US bird species to their habitats by predicting species encounter rates from satellite images, along with baseline models which demonstrate the power of our approach. Our methods open up possibilities for scalably modelling ecosystems properties worldwide. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change presents significant threats to global biodiversity, both directly and by compounding the effects of other anthropogenic stressors, such as habitat loss, pollution, and introduced species. Biodiversity loss in turn also impacts ecosystem services necessary to ensure food, water, and human health and well-being (Marselle et al., 2021). It is crucial to understand the changing distributions of species globally to inform policy decisions, for example in shaping land use and land conserva- tion choices. However, traditional methods for species distribution models (SDMs) generally focus either on narrow sets of species or narrow geographical areas. This is in part due to the methods’ computational cost, the insufficient ability of models to account for complex relationships between different variables, and the type of data used, whose availability can be limited (Phillips et al., 2005; Newbold, 2010). Machine learning algorithms for remote sensing have increasingly seen wide applicability across sustainability-related domains (see e.g. Rolf et al. (2021)) and have been suggested as a promis- ing tool for SDMs (Beery et al., 2021). Moreover, the surge of data collection on citizen science platforms along with improved data quality validation processes in recent years offers tremendous opportunity for scientific research, as species observation records from these sources can cover a larger temporal and geographic extent at a finer resolution and at lower cost than traditional sam- pling methods. Indeed, citizen science data and remotely sensed ecosystem attributes such as vegeta- tion indices have been shown to improve the performance of models, especially for less widespread species (Arenas-Castro et al., 2022). Recently, the GeoLifeCLEF challenge (Lorieul et al., 2022) was introduced with the goal of directly predicting plant and animal abundance from aerial images at 1mresolution, using deep computer vision. However, the GeoLifeCLEF benchmark has proven extremely challenging, potentially since only one species is associated with each location. We propose to use remote sensing to infer the joint distribution of many species for a given location, using publicly available citizen science observation records as ground truth. Our approach leverages the fact that a species’ presence or absence at a location depends on the ecosystem present there, and therefore the abundances of different species are highly correlated. Specifically, we predict the encounter rates of 684 bird species at sites across the continental USA. We focus on birds due to 1CCAI workshop at ICLR2023 the availability of high-quality bird observations and the ecological importance of birds, which play a vital role in almost every terrestrial ecosystem and are threatened significantly by climate change (Rodenhouse et al., 2008; Stephens et al., 2016). Our contributions include: (i) framing the task of predicting bird species encounter rates at a specific location using remote sensing data, (ii) building a dataset for this task, obtained from publicly available bird observation and satellite data sources, and (iii) showing the efficacy of baseline deep computer vision methods for this task. Problem definition. We consider presence-absence bird sighting records from the citizen science database eBird (Kelling et al., 2013). Each location (termed a hotspot ) in the eBird database is as- sociated to a number of complete checklists containing all species a birdwatcher was able to observe at a specific date and time. If his a hotspot, and s1,..., s nthe species of interest, then our goal is to build a machine learning model that takes as input a satellite image of h(and optionally other data) and predicts the vector yh= (yh s1,..., yh sn), where yh sis the number of complete checklists reporting species sathdivided by the total number of complete checklists at h. This ratio yh scan be understood as an encounter rate, the probability for a visitor to observe a species if they visit the hotspot. We aim at jointly predicting this quantity for all bird species in the region. Thus, our task can be considered as a supervised multi-output regression problem. We consider encounter rates as our target variable because they are a widely used measure in species distribution modeling, and are indeed used extensively on the eBird platform (in the form of “hotspot bar charts”) in order to summarize the species in a given location for bird\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
