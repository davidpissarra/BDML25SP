Its implementation will prove crucial in predicting crop yield, forest damage, or more generally the impact on ecosystems services rele- vant for socio-economic functioning, which if absent can lead to humanitarian disasters. Vegetation status depends on weather and environmental conditions that modulate complex ecological processes taking place at several timescales. Inter- actions between vegetation and different environmental drivers express responses at instantaneous but also time-lagged effects, often showing an emerging spatial context at landscape and regional scales. We formulate the land surface forecasting task as a strongly guided video prediction task where the objective is to forecast the vegetation developing at very fine resolution using topography and weather variables to guide the prediction. We use a Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) architecture to address this task and predict changes in the vegetation state in Africa using Sentinel-2 satellite NDVI, having ERA5 weather reanalysis, SMAP satellite measurements, and topography (DEM of SRTMv4.1) as variables to guide the prediction. Ours results highlight how ConvLSTM models can not only forecast the seasonal evolution of NDVI at high resolution, but also the differential impacts of weather anomalies over the baselines. The model is able to predict different vegetation types, even those with very high NDVI variability during target length, which is promising to support anticipatory actions in the context of drought-related disasters1. 1 Introduction Climate change is leading to an increase in extreme weather events, affecting both ecosystem and human livelihoods. Africa is one of the most vulnerable continents to climate change with droughts in the region expected to increase in severity according to the IPCC [ 1]. Given current projections of population growth and impacts from climate change, many more people will be affected by extreme drought events in the future [ 2]. Any insight into predicting their occurrences can help prepare short-term solutions to alleviate potential impacts on local and regional communities [3]. The local scale response to extreme events is often not homogeneous [ 4]. Abiotic ( e.g.soil type, topography, water bodies) and biotic ( e.g. vegetation type, plant rooting depth) factors and the interactions between them affect how vegetation responds to atmospheric extreme events [ 5,6].In 1https://github.com/earthnet2021/earthnet-models-pytorch.git Artificial Intelligence for Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Response: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Model prediction frame by frame.

This so-called ’memory effect’, arises from the complex processes involved in vegetation dynamics leading to non-linear interaction on several time scales [10,11] (e.g.the time-lagged effect of precipitation on vegetation due to the water soil recharge [ 12], legacy effect of earlier drought [6, 13] or early starting season [14]). Predicting the evolution and impacts of vegetation at the very local level is therefore a challenge to support anticipatory action before a disaster In this paper, we aim to create a model capable of learning the relationship between vegetation states, local factors and weather conditions, at a very fine resolution in order to characterise and forecast the impact of weather extremes from an ecosystem perspective. We use the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) [ 15] as a proxy for vegetation health monitoring.
