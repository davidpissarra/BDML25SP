This paper compares multiple low- resource approaches to nowcasting solar PV yield. To do so, we use a dataset of UK satellite imagery and solar PV energy readings over a 1 to 4-hour time range. Our work investigates the performance of multiple nowcasting models. The paper also estimates the carbon emissions generated and averted by deploying models such as these, and finds that short-term PV forecasting may have a benefit several orders of magnitude greater than its carbon cost and that this benefit holds for small models that could be deployable in low-resource settings around the globe. 1 Introduction Solar photovoltaics (PV) is one of the safest and cleanest sources of energy, as measured in death rates from accidents and air pollution, and greenhouse gas emission [10]. However, the fluctuations in the energy output, or yield, from solar PV makes it challenging for the electricity grid to rely at large scale on solar energy. The yield of solar PV is inherently uncertain because clouds can obscure the sun, and clouds can become thicker, thinner, and their movement across the sky is hard to predict [2]. In order to guarantee stable energy supply, grid operators often have to keep gas spinning-reserve online, releasing carbon dioxide into the atmosphere [6]. Forecasting over less than one day in advance is called ‘nowcasting’ [12] to emphasize its dynamic use. Nowcasting solar energy input into the grid accurately could reduce the need to keep the reserves on standby, allowing to use every kilowatt efficiently and enhancing the grid resilience to the fluctuations of renewable energy sources. Since 2019, Open Climate Fix (OCF) has been working with National Grid ESO, the electricity system operator for Great Britain, to build accurate PV nowcasting models that can enhance the resilience of the energy grid [4]. This paper complements the work done by OCF. Specifically, we research alternative low-resource methods (in terms of smaller/shallower neural networks architectures) for predicting PV yield, and analyse their performance, their carbon footprints and aim to estimate, even if roughly, the net emissions that could be averted by their potential use. As more of the world incorporates solar PV into energy grids, there will be an increased need to develop accurate solar PV forecasts. While a body of recent work has emphasized building more computationally efficient models, most of the machine learning work still focuses on the opposite: building larger models with more parameters to tackle more complex tasks [7]. Recent Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.work poses the question of how much is the performance gain worth [7], specially in these applications where deployment of a simple technology could already have a big impact. The move towards less computationally intensive models has already happened once in weather forecasting, as deep learning, despite its competitiveness, has often lower computational requirements than numerical weather prediction based on differential equations [11, 12]. Through our work, we study low-resource and shallower predictive models and try to estimate the benefit that they could bring if they were deployed large-scale for solar nowcasting1. The models, which are build on one Tesla T4 GPU available through Google Colab, could be deployed large-scale around the world independently of hardware limitations. The reason we are interested in researching this low-resource setting, by studying smaller models, is because those are the models that could be deployed to support the grid in emerging economies, which are where the real need is for clean energy solutions, i.e. where the energy demand is rapidly growing. 2 An empirical comparison of PV yield nowcasting: Experimental results For the task at hand, we study convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs) and their intersection [12] (ConvLSTMs). In theory, this comparison may seem futile as LSTMs and ConvLSTMs should outperform CNNs, because of their use of state information. However, Bai et al [1] argue that simpler CNNs can often outperform LSTMs. Moreover, ConvLSTMs require a large amount of memory simultaneously available in order to process and update the state information used in its predictions, which means they often take longer to train, leading to more energy usage and hence higher emissions. Dataset Solar generation data refers to the yield from specific solar panels. The dataset2is composed of satellite imaging and PV readings. The satellite images are provided by EUMETSAT, covering the northern third of the Meteosat disc every five minutes. Open Climate Fix developed the eumetsat_uk_hrv dataset [5] which takes the ‘high resolution visible’ (HRV) channel for a reduced time period and geospatial extent. The dataset was reduced in this paper to meet computing resources available.
