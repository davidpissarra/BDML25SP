As stated  in [1], drought can be categorized as agricultural, hydrological, meteorological,   and socioeconomic droughts. The first three deal with the mechanisms of measuring drought as a physical  phenomenon, while the last deals with drought in terms of supply and demand following shortage of rainfall [2 ]. In  Ethiopia, m ore than 80 percent of people rely on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Most of the  population  substantial ly dependent on rain -fed agriculture and the country’s economy is extremely vu lnera ble to the impacts of  drought  [21]. Thus, among all extreme climate events, drought is considered as the most complex phenomenon  affecting the country  due to the variable nature of climate condition  and the absence  of effective technology -oriented  climate change early warning system s at the national  level. As per the report from the Food and Agriculture  Organization of the United Nations (FAO), yet the increasing frequency and magnitude of climate disasters and plant  pests over the years have left m any communities particularly vulnerable to food insecurity [20]. Consecutive seasons  of poor rainfall in southern and southeastern pastoral areas of Ethiopia have severely limited feed and water availability  and significant livestock losses have driven ris ing food insecurity and malnutrition rates, which are largely a  consequence of insufficient and underfunded livelihoods response.   Through time, due to the frequent nature of drought in Ethiopia, indigenous peoples and local communities with a  long history  of interaction with the environment have dealt with climate changes and extreme drought events  using  indigenous knowledge. As a result, this knowledge can be important plus  to develop a system that guides the  community by adapting the daily activities of the co mmunity itself towards climate  mitigation and risk minimization  [12, 13]. This can also be considered as the usage of local knowledge with the idea of “local -solution s for local - problem s”. As indicated in the report, “Realizing the Future We Want”, the United Nation System Task Team on the  Post 2015 UN Development Agenda, acknowledges the importance of indigenous knowledge for environmental  sustainability [11] stating t hat “traditional and indigenous knowledge, adaptation and coping strategies can be major  assets for local response strategies”. The importance of indigenous peoples’ contribution in the adaptation to climate  change is also acknowledged in the Assessment Re port (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  (IPCC), which identifies indigenous and traditional knowledge as a “major resource for adapting to climate change”.   Studies carried out so far also stress the importance of indigenous knowledge i n the development by talking about the  idea of “development from below” [3]. Through their research illustrating the utility of indigenous knowledge, these  scholars attempted to raise awareness among policymakers about the importance of bottom -up perspecti ves to create  a more  locally appropriate and environmentally sustainable solutions. This is also an issue that was re -affirmed in the  International Indigenous Peoples’ Forum on Climate Change (IIPFCC). Besides this recognition, very little attention  has be en given by machine learning experts in order to integrate indigenous knowledge for climate change mitigation  strategies.   In this natural hazard, s ignificant hydrol ogical components such as storm, rainfall, stream flow, soil moisture, and  evaporation are substantially random in their beha vior, accordingly, climate change experts try to quantify it using   probability, statistics, and at -large stochastic approaches  oriented tools. Nowadays, development of drought  monitoring, forecasting  and prediction system have been achieved in many continents  and countries [4]. For instance,  in United State s [5], a drought monitoring system  which has a goal of tracking and displaying the magnitude and  spatial extent of drought and its impacts across the States is already mo delled and classifies drought into five classes  named as moderate, severe, extreme, exceptional, and abnormal drought using  six drought indicators. Moreover, other  researchers  have also conducted  drought monitoring for other continents [6, 7, 8, 9].  However, due to, variable  characteristics  of drought  from region to region  [10, 16], limited data set size, limited consideration of valuable local  knowledge related to climate change mitigations  and block -box nature of current model  development and  impleme ntation of regional and country -level monitoring and prediction model s is very crucial  for drought monitoring.  2   Therefore, in order to cope with drought at an early stage  and minimize its impacts, transfer learning based indigenous  knowledge -aware drought modeling and prediction using deep learning techniques is a solution  that creates  an  intelligent model  for drought monitoring, forecasting and prediction.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nDroughts significantly affect crop yields and cause food shortages, as well as a lack of animal forage. Droughts can be categorized into four types: agricultural, hydrological, meteorological, and socioeconomic. The first three types deal with measuring drought as a physical phenomenon, while the last type deals with drought in terms of supply and demand following a shortage of rainfall.\n\nIn Ethiopia, more than 80% of the population relies on agriculture and livestock for their livelihoods. Most of the population depends on rain-fed agriculture, and the country's economy is extremely vulnerable to drought impacts. Among all extreme climate events, drought is considered the most complex phenomenon affecting the country due to the variable nature of climate conditions and the absence of effective climate change early warning systems.\n\nThe increasing frequency and magnitude of climate disasters and plant pests have left many communities vulnerable to food insecurity. Consecutive seasons of poor rainfall in southern and southeastern pastoral areas of Ethiopia have severely limited feed and water availability, leading to significant livestock losses and rising food insecurity and malnutrition rates.\n\nIndigenous peoples and local communities with a long history of interaction with the environment have dealt with climate changes and extreme drought events using indigenous knowledge. This knowledge can be important in developing a system that guides the community in adapting daily activities towards climate mitigation and risk minimization.
