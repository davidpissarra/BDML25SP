We propose a more efficient approach to assessing climate-related information. We construct a model leveraging TF-IDF, sentence transformers and multi-label k nearest neighbors (kNN). The developed model is capable of assessing alignment of climate disclosures at scale, with a level of granularity and transparency that will support decision-making in the financial markets with relevant climate information. In this paper, we discuss the data that enabled this project, the methodology, and how the resulting model can drive climate impact. 1 Introduction The effects of climate change are accelerating globally, and it has been established that corporations are at risk of major financial loss due to climate impacts. A 2019 Carbon Disclosure Project report found that 215 of the world’s largest companies reported nearly USD $1 trillion at risk from climate change over the following five years[ 1]. This has motivated stakeholders to request transparency from companies regarding climate change induced risk and their strategy to address these risks - also known as climate-related financial information. In recent years, new regulatory standards and frameworks have been introduced to provide guidance to companies on what climate information they should be disclosing. Most notable among these are the 11 recommendations introduced in 2017 by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD). Each recommendation falls under one of four pillars (Governance, Strategy, Risk Management, and Metrics and Targets), and outlines information that a company should include in its reports. Despite the existence of climate disclosure regulations and frameworks such as the TCFD, there is a high degree of inconsistency in how companies communicate climate-related financial information. This information may be spread across discretionary reports (e.g. sustainability reports, climate reports, ESG reports) as well as regulatory reports (e.g. proxy filings, annual reports), and is often a small portion of the report in question. Manually parsing through reports to extract TCFD-relevant information remains a time-consuming task, impeding large-scale analysis of climate reporting. Previous attempts to solve this problem employ natural language processing (NLP) methods and have seen varying levels of success. A critical oversight of past work citing the TCFD is that their datasets do not contain all of the TCFD recommendations, or that there is a lack of transparency. Our prelimi- nary work and results show how we could assess TCFD-alignment across all 11 recommendations. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Additionally, we benchmark three models leveraging recent research in assessing TCFD-alignment and NLP on our dataset. Applied at the recommendation level, these models would enable automatic assessment of TCFD-alignment of companies across geographies and sectors. It would also create a path to drive climate action in the financial markets by benchmarking climate disclosures at scale and providing best practices in terms of climate risk management. 2 Related work Introduction of the TCFD recommendations prompted researchers to analyze trends and identify generalizations from existing climate-related financial disclosure patterns. While one-off analyses explore at a small-scale whether companies are TCFD-aligned, there is a push for market-wide assessment to compare companies against each other and drive climate action. The first organization to conduct such a review is the TCFD, in their status reports from 2020 and 2021. In these reports, they mention the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to review reports from 1,701 and 1,651 companies respectively [ 2,3]. The organization only briefly reveals how AI is used to assess TCFD-alignment, meaning that there is no way to evaluate their methodology or benchmark new models. Other research has looked at a variety of methods for analyzing climate-related content in reports. One approach queried reports using climate-relevant keywords [ 4] - further models can then be applied to the queried text [ 5]. Despite reducing the time required to assess company reports, this approach has a high likelihood of missing relevant information given that a keyword list cannot fully encapsulate climate disclosure language. This issue is compounded as climate language evolves and further information is missed. Language models (LMs) also show promise for identifying climate content in corporate reports. BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), introduced by Devlin et al. in 2018, is a transformer-based language model that provides state-of-the-art performance for most NLP tasks. Climate-related financial information is no exception, and BERT has shown the capability to detect climate risk-related content in company reports [ 7,8]. However, risk management is only one of the four TCFD pillars as such this is not comprehensive of a company’s TCFD alignment. Most relevant is the work of climateBERT, a DistilRoBERTa [ 9] model fine-tuned on climate-related financial disclosures to better incorporate context [ 10]. ClimateBERT has been applied to analyze whether companies who declared support for the TCFD are actually TCFD-aligned. This uncovered the reality that support for the TCFD is primarily cheap talk by companies [ 11]. Although\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
