We introduce a dual-branch recurrent neural network with convolutional lateral connections for blending the data. Experimental and ablative results show that the proposed system outperforms both the considered drought index and purely data-driven deep learning models. Our results suggest the potential of hybrid models for drought monitoring and open the door to synergistic systems that learn from data and domain knowledge altogether. 1 Introduction Droughts are one of the costliest natural disasters causing seriously destructive consequences on the ecological environment, agricultural production, and socio-economic impacts [ 1]. With global warming, the frequency of composite dry-heat events such as heatwaves and droughts has increased significantly. In these circumstances, advanced monitoring techniques are urgently required to effectively and rapidly detect droughts [2], as well as to ameliorate risk management [3]. Due to the complex physical, chemical, and biological processes involved in drought events, much effort has been devoted to developing climate indices and (mostly mechanistic) analytical tools. In general, drought indices have become standardized tools for objectively quantifying the characteristics of these episodes in terms of intensity, magnitude, duration, and spatial extent. Three widely-used indices are the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), which is based on a soil water balance equation [4]; the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), which is based on a precipitation probabilistic model [5]; and the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), which combines both approaches [ 6]. The run theory deploys a bridge between climate indices and drought characteristics analysis [ 7,8]. Other indices based on comprehensive remote sensing data have been proposed, either related to vegetation greenness, such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Vegetation Condition Index (VCI), or to water-limitation principles, as the Precipitation Condition Index (PCI) [9] and the Standardized Moisture Anomaly Index (SZI) [10]. Alternatively, data-driven models directly learn from historical drought records taking Essential Climate Variables (ECVs) as inputs to estimate drought intensity [ 11]. Existing models include but are not limited to k-nearest neighbors [ 12], artificial neural networks [ 13], support vector regression [13] and random forest [ 14]. More recently, deep architectures have been successfully employed, such as deep feed-forward neural networks [ 15], long short-term memory-based models [ 16], and advanced convolutional neural networks [17]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.The integration of data-driven and physical models captures attention and promises a new generation of models for the Earth Sciences [ 18]. The hybrid machine learning framework combines the flexibility and representation capability of machine learning approaches with the consistency of domain knowledge. Validated examples include precipitation forecasting [ 19], terrestrial evaporation [20], cloud detection [ 21], and biophysical parameter [ 22]. In this paper, we propose a Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) to synergistically combine deep learning models and climate indices for the first time toward drought monitoring. Our experimental results show that our HRNN outperforms both indices and data-driven models, supporting the potential of hybrid frameworks for drought monitoring. 2 Data Essential Climate Variables & Climate Indices First, we select total precipitation and air temper- ature @2m, which are well-known ECVs correlated to droughts, from the re-gridded ERA5-Land (0.083◦×0.083◦, 8 km2) data [ 23], covering the period from Jan 2003 to Dec 2018 with a temporal resolution of 8days. Second, SPEIs computed at different temporal resolutions (from 1to6months) are selected as the climate. SPEI measures drought severity by taking into account both intensity and duration, and also allows us identifying their corresponding onset and offset times. Besides, being based on a water balance equation and a precipitation probabilistic model, the index provides complementary information to the raw ECVs data. Last but not least, it is a multi-scalar index that enables the identification of different drought types. It should be noted that, for the sake of measuring the implicit expert knowledge gathered in the formulation of the index, potential evapotranspiration (PET) for the SPEIs is computed using an equation that only relies on the ECVs mentioned above [24], despite more accurate methods are available for this estimation. Drought Events & Dataset Splits The EM-DAT is a global database on natural disasters containing information about the occurrence and effects of more than 21,000 disasters in the world, from 1900 to the present [ 25]. In this study, time-series data of six recorded drought cases in Russia, Italy, and Afghanistan, from 2003 to 2018, are chosen. Two drought events are considered for each country, over extended regions covering these three countries,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
