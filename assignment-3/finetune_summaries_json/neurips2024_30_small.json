Using a crowdsourced evaluation dataset, we demonstrate that Climate PAL’s retrieved data are more relevant to user queries, with over 20% higher accuracy than baselines on several key metrics. 1 Introduction Climate change research relies on staggering quantities of data. A prominent example is the 30- petabyte Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) 6, which contains over 13,600,000 climate projection datasets [ 8]. Working with CMIP6 requires a range of technical knowledge, such as using specialized programming packages or understanding esoteric terms and abbreviations. These requirements pose challenges for less-experienced researchers, impede experts’ ability to quickly evaluate new hypotheses, and deter non-technical stakeholders from engaging with climate data. Figure 1: Climate PAL allows users to engage with CMIP6 climate data via conversational English through an intuitive graphical interface.To address these issues, we present Climate Projection and Analysis with Language models (Climate PAL), a Large Language Model-based system to retrieve and analyze 343,119 CMIP6 datasets generated by NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies (GISS) us- ing conversational English. Climate PAL will assist researchers and increase the accessibility of climate insights to the general public. Climate PAL is, to our knowledge, the first general-use conversational system for retrieval and analysis of CMIP6 climate data. The inter- face is designed to be simple, intuitive and easily adaptable to a variety of device resources and screen sizes.

By relying on In-Context Learning (ICL) techniques [ 17], our system requires no fine-tuning and will allow for easy incorporation of new CMIP datasets as they are released. We summarize our contributions as follows: •We propose Climate PAL for retrieval and analysis of CMIP6 datasets using conversational English. •We crowdsource a dataset of CMIP6 analysis queries to evaluate Climate PAL and future systems. • We demonstrate retrieved datasets are >20% more accurate than baselines in several metrics. 2 Method To motivate the design of Climate PAL, we provide additional information about the structure of GISS CMIP6. Next, we discuss each component of Climate PAL as summarized in Figure 2. Further details on Climate PAL’s architecture are in Appendix A. GISS CMIP61contains the evaluation data and outputs of six climate models. Its 343,119 datasets simulate more than 400 different variables over 90,000 years of the Earth’s past and future climate. CMIP6’s modeling tasks are referred to as Model Intercomparison Projects (MIPs), each of which contain different sub-tasks, called Experiments. Each CMIP6 dataset is described by a standardized set of attributes, which we refer to as descriptors. These descriptors include Variable (the dependent variable measured), Start andEnd Year (the range of years covered) and Temporal Resolution (whether Variable is measured hourly, monthly or yearly between Start and End Year), along with the MIP andExperiment to which the dataset belongs. Climate PAL’s Retrieval Component is responsible for selecting a dataset best-suited to answering the user query. Each time the user replies in a conversation, a GPT model [ 4,18] is prompted to summarize the query and any conversational history into a few keywords, then determine if it is necessary to retrieve a new dataset to answer the query. If so, the retrieval component first builds a profile of an ideal dataset by predicting each of the dataset’s descriptors. Next, a table of each GISS CMIP6 dataset is filtered to find the best match to the predicted descriptors. Apart from Variable, each descriptor is predicted by prompting GPT with the conversational summary, plus information such as which descriptor to predict and the descriptor’s set of possible values. Variable, however, is more challenging: there are 419unique Variables in GISS CMIP6, each with a precise, technical definition. We use a three-step technique to predict Variable by further summarizing the conversation, then performing an embeddings-based search to find the top ten closest matches to the summary and providing this shortlist in an ICL GPT prompt similar to the other descriptors’. The descriptor predictions form the profile of an ideal dataset for retrieval, but a dataset with this specific combination of descriptors may not exist in CMIP6. We filter all datasets by each descriptor’s prediction sequentially, skipping descriptors that cannot be satisfied due to previous descriptor values. The Analysis Component instantiates an OpenAI “Assistant\" GPT model with the proprietary Code Interpreter Tool [ 1], allowing GPT to execute code for tasks such as data visualization and mathematical computations. This GPT agent is prompted with the full conversational history and all retrieved datasets,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
