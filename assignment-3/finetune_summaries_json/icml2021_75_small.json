Introduction The consensus that human activity caused the climate crisis (Cook et al., 2016) has led to the development of many tools and agreements, designed to support climate change miti- gation efforts.

However, research efforts to mitigate the climate crisis are lost without an efﬁcient international adap- tation of proposed tools and policies. Scientists, non-state actors, and voters increasingly critique their government for insufﬁcient action mitigating climate change (Dupont & Oberth ¨ur, 2012). This suggests a gap between promises made by politicians and actual action taken: ambitious promises for climate change mitigation have turned into careless discourse with insufﬁcient mea- sures taken. Holding politicians accountable for their actions has been shown to be a major factor in preventing mismanagement, political corruption and misalignment of politician’s opin- ions and the public they are representing (Adsera et al., 2003; Lyrio et al., 2018). Transparency herein is so crucial, that it has been considered a direct substitute for accountability in the democratic process (Lyrio et al., 2018). Political trans- parency, unfortunately, has been made increasingly difﬁcult, not due to a lack, but because of the overwhelming quantity of data accessible: The public and civil society organiza- tions, lack the overview of all that politicians are discussing across a multitude of platforms such as interviews, blog posts, parliamentary speeches and social media posts. Our work therefore, provides a tool for transparency, supporting civil society in efforts to monitor political discourse around climate change and hold policy makers accountable for their promises and claims. In Section 2 we introduce a Multi-Source Topic Aggrega- tion System (MuSTAS) which increases transparency by providing an overview of topics discussed by politicians across a broad range of platforms. Additionally, MuSTAS provides a user interface with topic summaries and tagged source-texts. In Section 3 we describe the ML foundation for MuSTAS: a novel multi-source hybrid latent Dirichlet allocation model which forms the core of this research proposal. In Section 4 we outline how MuSTAS impacts climate change.Monitoring Policy Makers with Deep Neural Networks and Topic Modelling 2. Multi-Source Topic Aggregation System To help holding policy makers accountable, MuSTAS pro- cesses documents (e.g. speech transcripts, tweets, blog posts) from several publicly available sources into a com- pact report, highlighting the distribution of topics the can- didate or party has been discussing during the given time period on the given platforms.

This suggests a gap between promises made by politicians and actual action taken: ambitious promises for climate change mitigation have turned into careless discourse with insufficient measures taken.
