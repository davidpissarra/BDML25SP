One key application of these models is studying extreme weather events, such as heat waves or dry spells, which have significant socioeconomic and environmental consequences. However, the computational de- mands of running a sufficient number of simulations to analyze the risks are often prohibitive. In this paper we demonstrate that diffusion models – a class of gen- erative deep learning models – can effectively emulate the spatio-temporal trends of ESMs under previously unseen climate scenarios, while only requiring a small fraction of the computational resources. We present a diffusion model that is con- ditioned on monthly averages of temperature or precipitation on a 96×96global grid, and produces daily values that are both realistic and consistent with those av- erages. Our results show that the output from our diffusion model closely matches the spatio-temporal behavior of the ESM it emulates in terms of the frequency of phenomena such as heat waves, dry spells, or rainfall intensity. 1 I NTRODUCTION Earth System Models (ESMs) play an important role in estimating the risk of extreme weather events under different emissions scenarios. The rarity of such weather events means that data must be aggregated over numerous runs to get reliable statistics. However, the computational demands of ESMs limits the number of realizations that can be performed. By using existing data to learn the statistical characteristics of ESM output, emulators can address this issue, by generating thousands of realizations on the scale of minutes or hours rather than weeks or months. Machine learning approaches are well-suited to building such emulators, especially generative deep learning methods capable of learning to approximate complicated, high dimensional distributions. We present a de- noising diffusion probabilistic model that learns to closely model the spatio-temporal behavior of an ESM, producing month-long samples of either daily mean temperature or precipitation. Our emula- tor, DiffESM, can be steered to generate samples under novel climate scenarios (or existing climate scenarios for which we want to enlarge the sample size of daily variables) by conditioning genera- tion on a monthly mean map of the climate variable. Such monthly mean maps can be produced by existing emulators, like fldgen (Link et al., 2019) or STITCHES (Tebaldi et al., 2022). Once trained, the emulator offers a dramatic improvement over traditional ESMs in terms of speed, allowing for rapid investigation of the effect of climate scenarios on the distribution of extreme weather events, making it a valuable tool for climate researchers and policy-makers. Many researchers have utilized machine learning for weather and climate modeling. One key ap- plication is the use of machine learning for forecasting, including now-casting (Bromberg et al., 2019; Shi et al., 2017), sub-seasonal forecasting (He et al., 2020; Weyn et al., 2021) and seasonal climate forecasting (Monego et al., 2022). Using machine learning to improve the resolution of ESMs is another active area of research, as many ESM outputs are too coarse for local-scale predic- tions. Data-driven methods can be used to construct models of local-scale phenomena; for example, modeling clouds with physics-informed neural networks (Beucler et al., 2019; Rasp et al., 2018), or 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 improving the resolution of regional climate models with generative adversarial networks (GANs) and — more recently — diffusion models (Addison et al., 2022; Leinonen et al., 2021; Stengel et al., 2020). Certainly, computationally efficient emulation of ESMs themselves has a long tradition, from statistics-based methods (Holden et al., 2015; Castruccio et al., 2014) to generative deep learning approaches (Ayala et al., 2021; 2022; Puchko et al., 2020). In contrast to these prior generative deep learning approaches to ESM emulation using GANs, which are notoriously difficult to train, we find that our DiffESM is significantly easier to train and better approximates the ESMs as measured by several of the same metrics. 2 M ETHODS Diffusion models generate samples from a target distribution via an iterative denoising process that maps samples from a known distribution (Gaussian) to samples from the unknown target distribu- tion.
