Modeling CO2 transport and pressure buildup is central to understanding the responses of geosystems after CO2 injection and assessing the suitability and safety of CO2 storage. However, numerical simulations of geological CO2 storage often suffer from its multi-physics nature and complex non-linear governing equations, and is further complicated by flexible injection de-signs including changes in injection rates, resulting in formi-dable computational costs. New ideas have emerged such as data-driven models to tackle such challenges but very few have been fully developed and deployed as reliable tools. With the joint efforts of industry and universities, we are cur-rently working on a new mechanism of fostering cross-disci-plinary collaboration, developing, deploying, and scaling data-driven tools for CCS. A deep learning suite that can act as an alternative to CCS variable rate injection simulation will be the first tool developed under this mechanism. Based on the surrogate model, optimal design of injection strategy under pressure buildup constraints will be enabled with ma-chine learning. Introduction   Geological storage of CO2 in saline aquifers, depleted oil and gas fields or unmineable coal seams, represents one of the most important processes for reducing anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases.

CO2 storage in deep saline aquifers, in particular, is a vital option with an estimated capacity of ~ 103-104 Gt globally (IPCC, 2005).   Successful CO2 storage projects are necessitated by accu-rate prediction of geo-sequestration processes of CO2 with regard to specific reservoir conditions and injection config-urations. Numerical simulation is the primary tool used for predicting the flow transport of CO2 by solving conservation equations. In such practices, the prediction of CO2 transport is governed by highly non-linear partial differential equa-tions (PDEs) and requires fine spatial and temporal discreti-zation for accurate depiction of flow processes. Thus, large-scale numerical simulation is computationally expensive, inefficient and even infeasible for some CCS storage opti-mization problems.  Machine learning has recently shown a growing potential for applications to CCS problems as a substitute of conven-tional numerical simulation, with comparable fidelity as nu-merical simulations in some simple tasks, but at a much faster speed. For example, a rough set-based machine learn-ing (RSML) technique was used to test the storage integrity of geological reservoirs (Aviso et al. 2019). We could also apply support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) algorithms to predict CO2 trapping efficiencies in saline for-mations (Thanh and Lee 2021). In more complicated cases, typical outputs (for example, CO2 saturation distributions and pressure responses) from numerical simulators can be directly modeled by machine learning and deep learning  methods. By means of Bayesian learning and principle com-ponent analysis (PCA), the spatial distribution of CO2 con-centration and pressure at the top of the reservoir can be forecast accurately (Lu et al. 2022). Furthermore, CCSNet developed by Wen et al. (2021) used a temporal 3D CNN model architecture that can predict the dynamic changes of CO2 storage process in deep saline aquifers for single well injection scenarios with constant injection rates. Later, a Fourier neural operator-based deep-learning model (U-FNO) was proposed to extend state-of-art CNN models to address the effect of reservoir anisotropy on CO2 storage under sim-plified CO2 injection configurations, i.e., single well and constant rates (Wen et al. 2022). Such advances greatly im-proved the efficiency of dealing with multiphase transport problems associated with CO2 storage, representing several of the successful trials at intersection of CCS and machine learning.   In industrial-scale carbon sequestration operations, injec-tion designs (e.g., injection rate, injection scenario, well configuration, perforation interval) play a central role in de-termining CO2 storage capacity, risks and liabilities, and ul-timately the environmental and economic benefits of a pro-ject (Al-Khdheeawi et al., 2018).
