Consequently, a secure power system that can handle the complexities resulted from the increased renew- able power integration is crucial. One particular complexity is the possibility of cascading failures — a quick succession of multiple component failures that takes down the system and might also lead to a blackout. Viewing the prediction of cascading failures as a binary classification task, we explore the efficacy of Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs), to detect the early onset of a cascading failure. We perform experiments based on simulated data from a benchmark IEEE test system. Our preliminary findings show that GCNs achieve higher accuracy scores than other baselines which bodes well for detecting cascading failures. It also motivates a more comprehensive study of graph-based deep learning techniques for the current problem. 1 Introduction One of the greatest challenges of today’s world is tackling the problem of climate change and mitigate its effects on the ecosystem and mankind. The Paris Agreement on climate change as a part of COP26 to be held in Glasgow during November 2021 has set a target to minimize global warming to 1.5oC [1]. However, in order to meet this ambitious target, the emission of greenhouse gases like CO 2need to be drastically cut down. These gases are emitted to a large extent in serving the energy demands of modern society (around 25% greenhouse gas emissions are estimated to come from electricity and heating [ 2]). Therefore, in order to cut down emissions of greenhouse gases, it is a global trend to integrate more renewable sources (wind, solar, etc.) for electric power generation. According to the National Grid, a major Electricity Systems Operator (ESO) in UK, the average carbon intensity in 2020 fell to 181g of CO 2per kilowatt hour, a reduction of 66% over the last seven years [ 3]. Along similar lines, achievement of portfolio standards for renewable energy is one of the major thrust areas of the COP26 in reducing the impact of climate change [ 1]. However, integration of renewable energy sources (RES) into the power system can add uncertainty (due to their intermittent nature) andcomplexity (due to their power-electronics converters) to its dynamic behaviour. For instance, of particular concern for power system operators is the possibility of cascading failures. Therefore, accurate detection of those cascading failures in on their early stage is critical to maintaining the reliability and security of electric supply. In [4], the definition of cascading failure and its mitigating strategies are systematically introduced and summarized. Previous studies are mainly focused either on mitigation of cascading failures in the planning time frame (steady-state)[ 5,6] or simulating a simplified model of cascading failures [7]. In [ 8], an influence graph based techniques is proposed to model the evolution of cascading Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.AijTimeXtXt−1Xt+1(a)Structure of input data Chebyshev filter matrix xxxxxxGLUGLUGLUConvConvConvLayer NormDrop outAijT(ℒ)Input power  system features, XijTopology  adjacency  matrix, Topology  LaplacianGraph signal filteringFeature extractionClassificationTopology adjacency  matrix, AijInput power  system features, XijChebyshev filter matrix xxxxxxT(ℒ)Topology  LaplacianGLUGLUGLUConvConvConvLayer NormDrop outGLUGLUGLUSpatial  Convolutional LayerTemporal  Convolutional LayerNormalisation LayerDropout LayerOutput ClassTopology  adjacency  matrix, Aij(b)Framework for GCN techqniue Figure 1: GCN for predicting cascading failures in power system failures. Physics based methods for analysis of power system cascading failures[ 7] are expected to be computationally intensive due to the nature and scale of power systems (nonlinear dynamical systems represented by thousands of differential algebraic equations). This motivates the use of online measurements and machine learning techniques to predict cascading failures in a real-time manner. While near real-time security and stability assessment through machine learning has been studied in [9] and reinforcement based topology controllers in [10], prediction of cascading failures has not been well represented in literature. Motivated by the spatio-temporal aspects of cascading failures, in this work we seek to explore the efficacy of a Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) for predicting the occurrence of cascading failures in power system and comparison of performance with other baseline ML techniques. To authors’ best knowledge, this paper is among few earliest studies that adopt GCN for cascading failure problems. An accurate prediction of cascading failures is expected to enhance the security and resiliency of power systems, thereby supporting higher penetration of RES and thus forming pathways to a positive climate impact. 2 Methods Power system cascading failures and eventual blackouts are rare events and thus, field data related to such events is scarce and also not easily available from power utility companies due\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
