Computational gains for obtaining optimal solu- tions are also presented. 1. Introduction Electricity market dynamics are generally governed by (some form of) Optimal Power Flow (OPF): the compu- tation of (minimal cost) generation dispatch subject to re- liability and security constraints of the grid. The classical OPF derivation (AC-OPF) is a non-linear, non-convex con- strained optimization problem, which, when integrated with day-ahead unit commitment, forms a Mixed-Integer Pro- gram known to be NP-hard. Proliferation of renewable en- ergy resources (e.g. wind and solar) has exacerbated uncer- tainties in modern power systems, thereby necessitating OPF solutions in near real-time to sustain accurate representation of the system state, preferably combined with probabilistic techniques for modelling uncertainty such as scenario-based Monte-Carlo simulation (Mezghani et al., 2019). This re- quires sequential OPF solutions at rates unattainable by conventional algorithms. Typically, AC-OPF is solved using Interior-Point (IP) op- timization methods (Wachter & Biegler, 2006), which are computationally expensive given the required evaluation of the Hessian (second-order derivative) of the Lagrangian at each iteration, rendering a time complexity which scales superlinearly with system size. To guarantee suitable rates of convergence, grid operators instead often resort to cheap 1UCL Energy Institute, London, United Kingdom2Invenia Labs, Cambridge, United Kingdom.

However, such approximate frameworks are predisposed to sub-optimal estimations of locational marginal prices, engendering wasted emissions-intensive electricity generation – illustrated by the estimated 500 mil- lion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions per year by virtue of global grid inefﬁciencies (Surana & Jordaan, 2019). Extending the OPF objective to incorporate generator-wise emissions costing furthers the computational burden, hence enabling fast computation of AC-OPF not only facilities renewable energy generation, but is a direct method for climate change mitigation (Gholami et al., 2014). standard  AC-OPF        warm-start  AC-OPF         reduced  AC-OPF          Figure 1.

Applications of machine learning (ML) to OPF typically use regression techniques to directly infer the OPF solu- tion from grid parameters, bypassing conventional solvers, thereby shifting the cost from online optimization to ofﬂine training (Guha et al., 2019). However, since the optimal point is not necessarily a smooth function of the inputs, this approach requires training on relatively large data sets to obtain acceptable accuracy. Further, there is no guaran- tee that the inferred optimal solution is feasible (i.e. satis- ﬁes all constraints), and violation of important constraints could be catastrophic in the context of power systems. It is more pragmatic therefore to ensure convergence to the optimal solution by instead initialising the IP solver with the inferred optimal solution, a so-called warm-start (Figure 1, middle panel) (Baker, 2019), whereby the regressor is parameterised using a (meta-)loss function corresponding directly to the time complexity to minimise computational burden (Jamei et al., 2019).Deep learning architectures for inference of AC-OPF solutions Alternatively, the optimal active set (Misra et al., 2018) or the binding status of each constraint (Robson et al., 2020) can be inferred using classiﬁcation. Although the num- ber of constraints is exponential in system size (Deka & Misra, 2019), typically only a fraction constitutes the active set, thus a reduced problem (Figure 1, right panel) can be formulated whilst preserving the objective.
