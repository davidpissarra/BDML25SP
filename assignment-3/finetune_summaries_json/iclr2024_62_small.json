Previous research has established that long-term trends and short-term variability of temperature and precipitation affect vegetation activity. Motivated by the recent success of Transformer-based Deep Learning models for medium-range weather forecast- ing, we adapt the publicly available pre-trained FourCastNet to model vegetation activity while accounting for the short-term dynamics of climate variability. We investigate how the learned global representation of the atmosphere’s state can be transferred to model the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). Our model globally estimates vegetation activity at a resolution of 0.25◦while re- lying only on meteorological data. We demonstrate that leveraging pre-trained weather models improves the NDVI estimates compared to learning an NDVI model from scratch. Additionally, we compare our results to other recent data- driven NDVI modeling approaches from machine learning and ecology litera- ture. We further provide experimental evidence on how much data and train- ing time is necessary to turn FourCastNet into an effective vegetation model. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LSX-UniWue/ Global-Ecosystem-Modeling. 1 I NTRODUCTION Environmental changes affect the dynamics of terrestrial vegetation, which is involved in controlling water, energy and CO 2fluxes (Richardson et al., 2013), and is thus crucial for providing ecosystem services such as food, fiber and fuel (Piao et al., 2020). Hence, a profound understanding of the com- plex interplay of climate system variables and vegetation changes is desirable to achieve sustainable ecological management. Previous studies have shown that observed changes in vegetation can be attributed to both long-term and short-term changes in temperature and precipitation, i.e., climate change and climate variability (Burrell et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2019; Higgins et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2022; Seddon et al., 2016; Zhu et al., 2016). While the spatial arrangement of vegetation on a large scale is primarily dic- tated by climatic factors, the interplay between climate variability and the short-term dynamics of vegetation introduces a higher level of complexity (Papagiannopoulou et al., 2017; Pelletier et al., 2015). Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have been suggested to capture the complex nonlinear dynamics of those short-term dynamics. However, the employed models are either limited to a specific region (Robin et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023) or use a coarse global resolution with one pixel covering at least 0.5◦(≈55 km ) (Chen et al., 2021; Kraft et al., 2019). While there are statistical approaches that globally quantify the effect of climate variability on vegetation change on a finer spatial resolution up to 0.083◦, they only consider meteorological data on a coarse time scale, e.g., one data point per month (Burrell et al., 2020; Seddon et al., 2016). Nonetheless, the availability of long-term weather reanalysis datasets such as ERA5 (Hersbach et al., 2020), which comprises hourly high-resolution measurements of 0.25◦(≈27 km ) per pixel, provide the opportu- nity to model dependencies of short-term changes in meteorological variables on vegetation activity on a fine spatial and temporal resolution. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have demonstrated the capability to efficiently parse and exploit those vast amounts of meteorological data in the context of medium-range weather forecast- ing. Architectural improvements and increased compute availability have led to DL-based weather models that now perform on par with commonly used numerical weather systems (Bi et al., 2023; Lam et al., 2023; Pathak et al., 2022). These approaches learn a spatial representation of the atmo- sphere’s state by forecasting future atmospheric states. Previous studies have already shown that their trained atmospheric models can be finetuned to effectively solve other climate-related tasks such as statistical downscaling and climate projections (Lessig et al., 2023; Nguyen et al., 2023). Based on these advances, this work investigates how the pre-trained weather forecasting model Four- CastNet (FCN) (Pathak et al., 2022) can be adapted for globally modeling the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) (Tucker & Sellers, 1986; Vermote, 2019), a commonly used index for ap- proximating vegetation activity (Ferchichi et al., 2022).
