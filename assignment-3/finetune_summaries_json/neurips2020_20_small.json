Methane leaks across the supply chain are stochastic and intermittent, with a small number of sites (‘super-emitters’) responsible for a majority of emissions. Thus, cost-effective emissions reduction critically relies on effectively identifying the super-emitters from thousands of well- sites and millions of miles of pipelines. Conventional approaches such as walking surveys using optical gas imaging technology are slow and time-consuming. In addition, several variables contribute to the formation of leaks such as infrastructure age, production, weather conditions, and maintenance practices. Here, we develop a machine learning algorithm to predict high-emitting sites that can be prioritized for follow-up repair. Such prioritization can signiﬁcantly reduce the cost of surveys and increase emissions reductions compared to conventional approaches. Our results show that the algorithm using logistic regression performs the best out of several algorithms. The model achieved a 70 %accuracy rate with a 57 %recall and a 66 %balanced accuracy rate. Compared to the conventional approach, the machine learning model reduced the time to achieve a 50 %emissions mitigation target by 42 %. Correspondingly, the mitigation cost reduced from $85/t CO2e to $49/t CO2e. 1 Introduction As the main component of natural gas, methane (CH 4) is a potent greenhouse gas whose global warming potential (GWP) is 25 times that of carbon dioxide (CO 2) over 100 years [ 1]. Therefore, mitigating methane leaks from the oil and gas sector is a critical component of climate action in the United States and Canada. 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.There are three major challenges to effective methane emissions reductions. First, the stochastic and time-variant nature of methane emissions across geographically sparse sites makes leak detection challenging. Second, the occurrence of large leaks or ‘super-emitters’ is highly complex and not easily predicted. It depends on several variables such as infrastructure age, production volumes, geologic characteristics, maintenance procedures, and local weather conditions. Third, conventional approaches to ﬁnding these super-emitters take a brute-force approach (e.g., survey all sites) that are time consuming and expensive. Thus, an effective solution that can identify ‘super-emitter’ sites would reduce methane emissions, improve cost-effectiveness of methane regulations, and potentially help operators develop predictive capabilities and improve maintenance procedures. Regulations typically require operators to conduct leak detection surveys at all sites, followed by repairs – these are collectively called leak detection and repair or LDAR programs. Most regulatory agencies currently require the use of optical gas imaging (OGI) technology to conduct leak detection surveys. OGI-based LDAR surveys are walking surveys typically performed by a crew of 1 – 2 people at a survey rate of 3 – 5 sites per day. Leaks detected during this survey are ﬂagged for subsequent repairs. However, conducting these surveys is time-consuming and costly. Modeling efforts have focused on understanding the relationship between emissions and other site characters. Several studies have investigated the association between emissions and attributes like production and site age [ 2,3,4,5,6]. The common approach is to use multiple linear regressions to analyze the percentage of variance in emissions explained by production volume. A recent study [7] used a logistic regression model to predict occurrence of site-level emissions, which found well age, oil production, and energy content from oil to have stronger predictive power compared to other parameters. However, the stochasticity in the occurrence of leaks and the inﬂuence of several known and unknown variables make deterministic approaches such as linear regressions over a small number of variables generally ineffective. In this work, we explore a machine learning approach to estimate the probability of a site being a ‘super-emitter’. Compared to previous approaches, machine learning models are better suited to the task because they do not require explicit delineation of the relationship between exogenous variables and methane emissions. Using data collected from recent ﬁeld studies, we will train the model to estimate the probability of super-emitting sites without the need to explicitly deﬁne model parameters that affect emissions. Moreover, machine learning techniques can address the imbalanced dataset problem typically seen in oil and gas methane emissions distributions as a signiﬁcant amount of emissions come from only a small number of sites [ 8]. The outcome of the model can guide operators to prioritize these high-emitting sites for repair. 2 Methods The prediction problem is posed as a probabilistic classiﬁcation problem – the outcome indicates a site’s likelihood to be high-emitting.
