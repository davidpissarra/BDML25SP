However, if done incorrectly, it may lead to earthquakes and leakage of CO2back to the surface, harming both humans and the environment. These risks are exacerbated by the large amount of uncertainty in the structure of the storage formation. For these reasons, we propose that CCS operations be modeled as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and decisions be informed using automated planning algorithms. To this end, we develop a simpliﬁed model of CCS operations based on a 2D spillpoint analysis that retains many of the challenges and safety con- siderations of the real-world problem. We show how off-the-shelf POMDP solvers outperform expert baselines for safe CCS planning. This POMDP model can be used as a test bed to drive the development of novel decision-making algorithms for CCS operations. 1 Introduction While global warming continues to pose an existential risk to humanity, the latest IPCC report [1] suggests that reducing emissions by half before 2030 will secure a livable future. A wide variety of measures will be necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but in all signiﬁcant reports, carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), where carbon is permanently removed from the atmosphere, accounts for about one-quarter to two-thirds of the cumulative emission reduction [2], [3]. Geological carbon storage, where CO2is stored into subsurface formations such as saline aquifers, is a promising technique due to its scalability and the recent increases in the price of CO2[4]–[6], and will be the focus of this work.

Figure 1: A simpliﬁed model for CCS operations ammenable to automated decision making. Even though CCS projects are similar to other, well-studied, subsurface problems such as groundwater or oil and gas applications, they involve additional and unsolved challenges. First, much less is known about saline aquifers compared to oil and gas reservoirs, resulting in signiﬁcantly higher subsurface uncertainty. Second, the interaction of supercritical CO2, brine, and rock results in complex physical and chemical processes such as trapping mechanisms, mineral precipitations, and geomechanics that must be accounted for. Lastly, injection of CO2into geological formations comes with signiﬁcant risks such as induced earthquakes, fractured cap rocks, and reactivation of faults that can lead to leakage, harming human life and the environment. Therefore, any decision made in the course of a CCS project needs to balance the trade-off between safety and the utilization of storage capacity to keep the project economically viable. CCS operations require a large number of sequential decisions to be made under uncertainty, such as selecting aquifers from a portfolio, choosing injection rates, deﬁning well locations, selecting information gathering campaigns, and selecting monitoring strategies. The inherent subsurface uncertainty combined with complex physio-chemical processes results in a challenging decision problem for CCS operations that require a tight coupling of information gathering and acting. For these reasons, we propose to formulate CCS as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and rely on POMDP solvers [7] to inform the decision-making process. Related work : Quantifying subsurface uncertainty is especially important for successfully imple- menting safe and effective CCS operations and monitoring. Although considerable research has been devoted to developing better uncertainty quantiﬁcation techniques [8], [9], signiﬁcantly less attention has been paid to determining how to act on that information. Prior work has focused on non-sequential optimization approaches [10], [11], or the use of sequential approaches in other subsurface domains such as oil/gas [12] and groundwater [13]. In this work we introduce a POMDP model of CCS operations based on simpliﬁed physics in order to spur the development of more advanced solution techniques that can produce safe and reliable plans.
