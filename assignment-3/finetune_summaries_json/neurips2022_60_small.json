As an object of study, ideology is then amenable to a generative modelling approach within the text-as- data paradigm. Here, we analyze the structure of ideology underlying carbon tax opinion using topic models. An idea, termed a topic, is operationalized as the fixed set of proportions with which words are used when talking about it. We characterize ideology through the relational structure between topics. To access this latent structure, we use the highly expressive Structural Topic Model to infer topics and the weights with which individual opinions mix topics. We fit the model to a large dataset of open-ended survey responses of Canadians elaborating on their support of or opposition to the tax. We propose and evaluate statistical measures of ideology in our data, such as dimensionality and heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss the implications of the results for transition policy in particular, and of our approach to analyzing ideology for computational social science in general. 1 Introduction Mitigating the worst effects of climate change requires that our society shift away from burning fossil fuels as its primary energy source. Additional, parallel transitions in other areas of society are likely needed to achieve this [ 1]. One such area is economics, where one transition feature is internalizing the cost of pollution. A price on carbon is an instrument to do this that economists agree is simple, flexible, and can be easily set on schedule to rise as needed. Several countries have instituted such pricing systems, but a major obstacle in wider adoption appears to be a lack of public support. Public support for carbon pricing typically falls along ideological lines, with conservatives on the right of the political spectrum opposing the policy This is in spite of rebate programs that funnel collected taxes back to most citizens (8/10 households in Canada are estimated to currently receive ∗mptouzel.github.io Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.more than they pay as a result of the policy). Recent work has studied the effects of rebates on people’s support for the policy [ 2]. In particular, survey participants tend to underestimate the size of the rebate they receive. What is the effect of communicating the factual benefits of the tax? When participants were then shown how much they received, their support of the policy remained unchanged. Such behaviour is not necessarily irrational: strong priors can make rational decision-making insensitive to new data [ 3]. After being shown the evidence, the participants’ belief that they were net losers (paid out more than they received) did change, however: surprisingly, it strengthened! These results suggest that there is a broader value system being recruited here that, if better understood, could inform the design of more effective communication of the policy’s benefits. We hypothesized that oppose responses arise from a well-worn ‘tax is bad’ ideology, involving a handful of correlated ideas (’distrust of government’, ’unfairness’, etc.) that mutually enforce each other. Here, we used Canadian survey data [ 2] and a generative bag-of-words model of word responses to infer the topic structure underlying the three types of responses ( oppose,support, and not sure ). We find moderate, significantly significant evidence for this hypothesis across a set of mutually independent metrics, agnostic to semantics. 2 Related Work Many measures of corpus analysis study frequency of word usage2, which does not expose how the same words can be used when talking about different things. Other broadly used approaches such as sentiment analysis classify responses into only a few affective classes (‘like’/‘dislike’). By formulating a rich latent topic structure, topic models address both these limitations. Topc models are now an established approach to understanding human-generated responses in the social sciences [ 4]. The Structural Topic Model in particular has been applied to understand open-ended responses on a carbon tax in Spain [ 5], Norway [ 6], and the US [ 7]. Here, we make a similar application to data obtained in Canada. Unlike these previous works we focus on topic-topic correlations as a means to interrogate ideology. 3 Method Topic models are generative probabilistic models that generate words in a response from an underlying set of topics, each given as the set of usage frequencies of words in a given vocabulary. Topic models are typically bag of word models, which eschew grammar and syntax to focus only on the content and prevalence of words. We exploit the availability of rich metadata by picking a topic model with rich latent structure of word usage statistics: the Structural Topic Model (STM) [ 8].
