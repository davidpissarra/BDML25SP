We demonstrate that tree species information and their three-dimensional geomet- ric shapes can be estimated from aerial imagery in order to determine the tree’s biomass. Speciﬁ- cally, we estimate a total of 52;000tons of carbon sequestered in trees for New York City’s borough Manhattan. 1. Introduction Recent environmental reports underline the pressing need for the elimination of Green House Gases (GHG) from the atmosphere in order to bring the carbon dioxide level to the pre-industrial norm (IPCC). Carbon removing techniques span from scrubbing emission sources, manufacturing car- bon trapping materials, and sequestering carbon in trees or soil. One popular idea proposed recently is the afforestation of 900 billion hectares of land (Bastin et al., 2019), which has the potential to offset more than 200 megatons of car- bon from the atmosphere. In the emerging carbon trading market, companies may purchase forested land to offset their GHG emission and reduce carbon footprints(L ¨utjens et al., 2019). There is a need for tools and platforms able to quantify in near real time and track GHG emissions and total carbon offsets. Such tools may need to estimate the total carbon stored in trees or in soil multiple times a year to support a fair and transparent carbon trading market. 1IBM Research, Yorktown Heights, NY, USA2German Aerospace Center (DLR), Weßling, Germany.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at ICML 2021.Currently, carbon sequestration is estimated by a plethora of proprietary tools and models, making it hard to compare side by side carbon sequestration models. Carbon storage estimates typically rely on generic models where shape, den- sity, and species distribution of trees is surveyed from small sample plots. Subsequently, ﬁgures on larger geographies and environments get extrapolated (Sileshi, 2014). The maximum amount of carbon captured by a tree is pre- dominantly limited by its geometric size which, in turn, is bounded by physics such as water transport from roots to leaves (Koch et al., 2004). Hence, knowledge of tree coverage, their geometric sizes and species characteristics is crucial in providing accurate carbon storage estimates. At the same time the task is technically challenging since such information is not readily available for the majority of locations on the planet (Chave et al., 2014). In this work, we propose to exploit remote sensing data in order to determine tree coverage, estimate tree’s geometric shapes & species to ultimately quantify the carbon seques- tration in those trees at scale. Speciﬁcally, we train machine learning models to analyze aerial imagery to determine tree coverage, to classify their species, and to determine the local allometric relation for each tree species. LiDAR data from a sample region is utilized to locally calibrate the biomass estimation model. Model inference does not require LiDAR data. Hence, the learnt relation may get exploited in regions with only aerial imagery available. As an illustration, we generate a high-resolution map of carbon sequestration in New York City’s urban forest. 2. Related work Tree allometric estimation.

Estimates of tree dimensions is important to infer the total biomass which, in turn, relates to the carbon stored in trees. The literature poses the quest to establish a generic scaling law correlat- ing tree height with tree lateral dimensions (Klein et al., 2019) to better estimate the above ground biomass (Chave et al., 2014).
