We use 3 datasets of increasing complexity with 18 different gap-filling methods and provide a guide to which methods are useful in which circumstances. If few dataset features are available, or the gap consists only of a missing time step in a record, then simple interpolation is often the most accurate method and complex models should be avoided. However, if more features are available and the gap involves non-reporting emitters, then machine learning methods can be more accurate than simple extrapolation. Furthermore, the secondary output of feature importance from complex models allows for data collection prioritisation to accelerate the improvement of datasets. Graph based methods are particularly scalable due to the ease of updating predictions given new data and incorporating multimodal data sources. This study can serve as a guide to the community upon which to base ever more integrated frameworks for automated detailed GHG emissions estimations, and implementation guidance is available at https://hackmd.io/@luke-scot/ML-for-GHG-database-completion. 1 Introduction Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions datasets are often incomplete both at facility level ( 1) and at national level ( 2). Countries and companies are accelerating emissions reduction strategies inline with the Paris agreement and net-zero objectives ( 3;4;5;6), but incomplete and inaccurate datasets remain a barrier to effective policy-making ( 7;8;9). Large companies are required to use emissions intensity factors, provided by government entities or taken from life-cycle assessment databases ( 10;11;12), to convert their facilities’ activity data to GHG emissions. The 3 main causes of incompleteness at this level are: companies excluded from reporting regulations, lack of transparency, and non-compliance (9;13). For companies, the resulting uncertainty, can lead to erroneous net-zero calculations and missed emissions ( 14). The facility-level data is then aggregated to a national estimate grouped in to source types and reported yearly by UNFCCC annex I parties. Only 43 out of 198 countries are considered annex I, accounting for ∼20% of global emissions, while non-Annex I countries have Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023inconsistent reporting ( 15). National reports are further limited by the standardised breakdown used by the UNFCCC and the accumulation of these uncertainties can lead to the misunderstanding of emissions reduction progress and misinformed policy decisions (15). The most accurate gap-filling solution is to require all emitters to conduct full life-cycle assessments for their products, but this is not viable at large scale due to the expense and difficulty involved (16;17). Data fusion, combining multiple data sources has resulted in some country-wide and industry-wide emissions databases ( 18;19;8;20;21), but these either lack facility-level granularity or have incomplete coverage of facilities. A second option, which we will explore in this study, is to improve data coverage and quality by ‘gap-filling’ emissions datasets using the available data to infer the unavailable data. Inference and machine learning methods have been implemented for improving process emission estimates in life-cycle assessments ( 22;23;24;25), quantifying uncertainty in material flow analysis ( 26;27), and data mining for industrial ecology ( 28;29), but have so far been unsuccessful in capturing the complexity and types of inputs required for full GHG emissions estimates ( 30;31;32). Gap-filling emissions datasets is a crucial problem where data science may help if industrial ecologists are equipped with the knowledge of which machine learning techniques can be used to tackle which problems. This paper seeks to address this gap and respond to the call for data-driven innovation in the community ( 32;9;33) by introducing 18 classification models that can be applied to the 3 types of gap-filling problem that we define in section 2. Section 3 will assess the performance of each model when applied to gap-filling problems across 3 GHG emissions databases and section 4 will discuss the implications of the results. An interactive guide is available athttps://hackmd.io/@luke-scot/ML-for-GHG-database-completion. It can serve as a reference for the community and provide a base for future development of multimodal frameworks for inferring company-specific emissions estimations, inline with urgent needs from companies and governments as they attempt to achieve their net-zero targets. 2 Methods In table 1 we present 3 types of gap addressing increasingly challenging problems in GHG emissions datasets. Level 1 considers an emitter with some reporting records, but with missing time steps. Level 2 considers an emitter with no reports at any time step, but with properties that are shared with other emitters in the database. Level 3 considers an emitter with no reports at any time step and with at least one property that is not shared with any other emitter in the database, for example for a facility in a country with no reporting facilities at\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
