Introduction In 2018, global energy-related CO 2emissions reached a his- toric high of 33.1 gigatonnes. These emissions are caused by the burning of fossil fuels, mainly natural gas, coal and oil, which accounted for 64% of global electricity produc- tion in this same year (IEA, 2018). Greenhouse gases like CO2are responsible for climate change which threatens to change the way we have come to know Earth and human life. For the previous reasons, there has been a global effort to shift from a fossil fuel based energy system towards a renewable energy one. In fact, it is expected that by 2050 wind energy will represent 14% of the world’s total primary energy supply (DNV-GL, 2018). The operation and maintenance costs of Wind Turbines (WTs) can account for up to 30% of the cost of wind energy (EWEA, 2009).

There have been recent efforts to monitor and detect in- cipient faults in WTs by harvesting the high amounts of data already generated by their Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) systems, which, in turn, enables the wind farm owners to employ a predictive maintenance strategy. In fact, it is expected that by 2025 new predictive maintenance strategies can reduce the cost of wind energy by as much as 25% (IRENA, 2016). One of the main meth- ods for monitoring the condition of WTs is building Normal Behaviour Models (NBMs) of the component temperatures. The fundamental assumption behind the use of NBMs is that a fault condition is normally characterized by a loss of efﬁciency, which results in increased temperatures. By using SCADA data to build a model of the temperatures of the WT components, one can calculate the residuals, which are the difference between the real values measured by the sensors and the predicted values by the model. These residu- als can be used to detect abnormally high temperatures that may be indicative of an incipient fault. Multiple works (Zaher et al., 2009; Mesquita et al., 2012; Brandao et al., 2015) have reported good results using NBMs to predict WT failures, being able to predict failures in WT components months in advance. In these works the authors used as features active power, nacelle temperature and lagged values of the target temperature, thus including autoregressive properties into to the model, to predict the temperatures of various components. In (Schlechtingen & Santos, 2011) and (Bach-Andersen et al., 2016) the authors obtained an important result: although the use of autore- gressive features resulted in better temperature modelling performance it also resulted in worse fault detection perfor- mance. Another important result was obtained in (Banga- lore et al., 2017) and (Tautz-Weinert, 2018), which indicated that using features that are highly correlated with the target also increased the modelling performance but decreased the fault detection performance of the model.

Introduction\n\nIn 2018, global energy-related CO2 emissions reached a historic high of 33.1 gigatonnes.
