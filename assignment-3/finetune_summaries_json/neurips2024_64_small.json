To mitigate this, we quantify the impact of increasing intermittent generation from wind and solar on thermal power plants in Chile and introduce a hybrid wind speed forecasting methodology which combines two custom ML models for Chile. The first model is based on TiDE, an MLP-based ML model for short-term forecasts, and the second is based on a graph neural network, GraphCast, for medium-term forecasts up to 10 days. Our hybrid approach outperforms the most accurate operational deterministic systems by 4-21% for short-term forecasts and 5-23% for medium-term forecasts and can directly lower the impact of wind generation on thermal ramping, curtailment, and system-level emissions in Chile. 1 Introduction Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy for electricity generation has a direct impact on climate change, since electricity generation globally contributes to roughly a third of annual carbon emissions [11]. However, the integration of renewable energy sources into the electric grid is challenging due to the operational difficulties of managing their highly variable power generation. Chile has taken a globally leading role in clean energy and has emerged as a leading destination for solar and wind developers and ambitious clean energy goals for the future [ 6]. This makes it a particularly interesting and important area of study for renewable energy forecasting. While Chile’s electricity demand is relatively modest (6.5% of Central and South America’s total in 2022), it is growing rapidly, both in aggregate (up from 40 TWh in 2000 to 88 TWh in 2022) and per-capita (70% over the same period). In 2023, the share of thermal, solar and wind in annual generation in Chile was 38.9%, 19.9%, and 11.8% [ 4]. Electric grid Independent System Operators (ISOs) recognize the need for precise renewable generation and net demand forecasts. Historically, thermal plants provided stable generation with predictable net demand patterns. However, increased penetration of renewables necessitates advanced forecasting due to significant generation ramps from wind and solar. Accurate forecasts are critical for subsequent thermal generator dispatch, which rely on forecast accuracy and ∗These authors contributed equally to this work.

Among renewable sources, wind power prediction is particularly challenging due to its temporal and spatial variability, and oftentimes lack of sufficient high-quality data, not only for wind power but for wind speed itself [ 21]. Our work aims to contribute to improving the coordination and control of Chile’s electric power system amidst growing renewable energy integration by enhancing the reliability and accuracy of wind speed forecasts. Our approach diverges from traditional forecast methods by applying machine learning techniques. Traditionally, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models, which have been the cornerstone of weather forecasting for decades, process current weather observations to predict future weather by solving fundamental physical equations of fluid dynamics and thermodynamics. These models integrate various atmospheric parameters such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure across different altitudes and geographical locations. Despite their sophistication, NWP models face limitations, such as diminished accuracy over time, dependency on high-quality input data, computational constraints affecting resolution, and challenges in physics-based modeling of complex processes like cloud formation and precipitation. In contrast, Machine Learning-based Weather Prediction (MLWP) models leverage historical data to identify patterns not easily captured by explicit physics-based modeling. These models use advanced machine learning (ML) algorithms to improve forecasting accuracy and efficiency, particularly in short-term predictions. MLWP has shown promise in areas like sub-seasonal heat wave prediction [ 7] and precipitation nowcasting [ 17]. For short-term weather forecasting, a range of MLWP approaches have been employed – including advanced statistical models [ 19], graph neural networks (GNN) [ 12,8], long short-term memory (LSTM) networks [ 18,14], and models that combine a differentiable solver for atmospheric dynamics with machine-learning components models [?] – demonstrating improved performance in specific applications. We introduce a novel hybrid methodology for short and medium-term wind speed forecasts, designed as an input to the ISO’s unit commitment and economic dispatch models in the day-ahead and week-ahead electricity market. For short-term forecasts (0 to 48 hours) we develop a custom ML model specifically optimized for capturing the intricate temporal dependencies in hourly wind speed. For medium-term forecasts (2 to 10 days), we develop a custom ML model based on GraphCast — a graph neural network-based machine learning weather prediction (MLWP) model for medium-range weather forecasts [9, 10]. 2 Data & Methods Data.
