CHGNet’s predictions will be compared and benchmarked to corresponding values calculated by density functional theory (DFT) [ 7] and other models to determine its efficacy. 1 Introduction The discovery of novel catalysts plays a pivotal role in facilitating efficient and carbon-neutral methods for energy storage and conversion [ 3,10]. Around 90% of global chemical processes use catalysts for efficient production [ 1], making catalyst development vital for environmental sustainability. However, as the demand for more efficient and sustainable catalysts grows, the vast number of potential catalyst candidates renders experimental testing impractical. Traditional methods of catalyst synthesis and testing to fit specific parameters become inefficient and costly [ 11]. Computational screening methods have become critical to the design process. However, modeling the surface reaction network of catalysts is complex and expensive. Common simulation tools like density functional theory (DFT) [ 7] are examples where computational cost is a limiting factor in discovering new catalysts [6]. Applying machine learning to molecular simulations provides an efficient way to model complicated configurations of surface adsorptions. An essential parameter in this screening process is the adsorp- tion energy [ 12], which denotes the strength of attachment between an adsorbate and the surface of a catalyst. The rate of a chemical reaction, a parameter of high practical importance, correlates with absorption energies. Accurate prediction of the global minimum energy of adsorption holds the potential to estimate the catalyst’s influence on the overall reaction rate. This is a key criterion for evaluating candidate catalyst materials and addressing global energy demands. We propose using the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet) to predict the global minimum adsorption energy given the large-scale catalyst dataset OC20. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2 Background and Previous Work Deng et al. [ 3] trained a machine learning interatomic potential (MLP) called the Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network (CHGNet), which is a universal potential and applicable for a wide range of compositions consisting of 89 elements from the periodic table. Since the simulation of large-scale systems with complicated electron interactions remains a signif- icant hurdle in the realm of atomistic material modeling, they used energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments from the Materials Project [ 4] Trajectory Dataset, a dataset containing over a decade’s worth of density functional theory static and relaxation trajectories of about 1.5 million inorganic structures, to pre-train CHGNet. It has been demonstrated to be the best universal MLP to predict the formation energy for solid-state materials [ 9]. Although they demonstrate the application of CHGNet to several solid-state materials, there is no research exploring the performance of CHGNet on the complex surfaces with different adsorbates as of writing. We will assess the energy, force errors, and adsorption configures of CHGNet when applying the pre-trained model on the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset, which covers a larger structure and chemistry space and various surfaces and different adsorbates. Furthermore, we will add the OC20 dataset and fine-tune or retrain a new version of CHGNet to extend the capability of CHGNet for systems that include surfaces and adsorbates. 3 Approach In this work, we will first be benchmarking the performance of CHGNet on the pre-relaxed dataset. We will then assess the mean absolute error (MAE) [ 8] in calculating the adsorption energy using the static calculation of the off-the-shelf CHGNet model. The performance of CHGNet, in calculating the adsorption energy using relaxations with different initial structures, will be evaluated based on two cases: unrelaxed structures and pre-relaxed structures from the OC20 data. After initial relaxations, we will assess the forces error via the comparison of the forces outputs from CHGNet and the forces from the DFT outputs given the same structure. The predicted structure configurations from CHGNet relaxation will be compared to the DFT results. After calculating the computational success rate using the off-the-shelf (pre-trained) CHGNet model, we will check the convergence and compare the values to the established DFT or highest-performing OC20 model values. If the convergence metric fails and the MAEs for energy and forces are larger than the best model, we will fine-tune or retrain the CHGNet model by incorporating the OC20 dataset. We will repeat this approach iteratively until the MAEs for energies and forces are lower than the current state-of-the-art models, and the convergence criterion is met. Based on the structure predictions, we will also ensure that the predicted structures do not violate any physical constraints, including desorption when the adsorbate fails to bind\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
