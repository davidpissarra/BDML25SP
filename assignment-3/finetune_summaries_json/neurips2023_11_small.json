In spite of the improvement in MJO predictions made by machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, most of them cannot provide the uncertainty levels in the MJO forecasts directly. To address this problem, we develop a nonparametric strategy based on Gaussian process (GP) models. We calibrate GPs using empirical correlations. Furthermore, we propose a posteriori covariance correction that extends the probabilistic coverage by more than three weeks. 1 Introduction The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO), first discovered by [ 1], is the dominant mode of intraseasonal variability (20–100 days) of the tropical atmosphere. The MJO is described as one of the engines of the climate system [ 2] powering the atmospheric circulation in the tropics and extratropics. The atmospheric teleconnections to the extratropics represent one of the major sources of predictability on the subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale [ 3]. S2S forecasts have been identified to be more broadly useful to climate decision makers than are climate projections [ 4]. The MJO forms in the equatorial Indian Ocean and propagates eastward along the equator alternating between phases of active and suppressed rainfall. In 2004, Wheeler and Hendon [ 5] introduced the Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) index for describing the MJO characteristics including its magnitude and phase. The RMM index consists of a pair (in quadrature) of principal component (PC) time series known as RMM1 and RMM2 ( RMM =p RMM12+RMM22). RMM1 and RMM2 are the first two PCs of combined outgoing longwave radiation and zonal winds in the lower (850 hPa) and upper (200 hPa) troposphere averaged between 15S and 15N. The MJO can alter weather patterns over the Earth, influence the El Niño–Southern Oscillation events, and affect the tropics and mid-latitudes, such as monsoons, rainfalls, extreme heat events, and tropical cyclogenesis. The accurate forecast of MJO can assist in agriculture, disaster response, and economic planning. In recent decades, many efforts have been made to improve MJO forecasting, but most methods rely on dynamical models [ 6,7,8] or artificial neural networks (ANNs) [ 9,10,11,12,13,14] that have limited ability in quantifying the uncertainty of predictions. To fill this gap, we introduce a probabilistic model for predicting the amplitude and phase of the MJO. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Time series of RMMs (Jan-01-1979 to Dec-31-2022). In this paper we employ Gaussian process (GP) models with empirical correlations to predict and quantify the uncertainty of the RMMs. In addition to quantifying the uncertainties, we demonstrate that our nonparametric model has a better prediction skill than the ANN models for the first five forecast lead days. The results of our experiment are also available on the project website http: //gp-mjo.github.io/. 2 Data The daily MJO RMM index dataset1used in the study is provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. RMM1 and RMM2 values are available from June 1, 1974, to the most recent date. Because of the missing values before 1979, we select the dataset from January 1, 1979, to December 31, 2022, for our study (Figure 1). The dataset is divided into three subsets: the training set is used to determine the parameters of the prediction and corresponding variance, the validation set is used to obtain the corrected variance with increasing lags, and the test set is used to verify the results. 3 Method We defer the background material on forecasting and GPs to Appendix A. Model We denote the values of RMM1 and RMM2 on the tth day by z(1) tandz(2) t, respectively. Suppose [z(1) t, z(2) t]⊤is a bivariate GP defined as in (9).
