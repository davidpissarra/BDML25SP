Introduction Bird migration is an important ecological phenomenon. Mi- grating birds act as long distance dispersal agents for many other species of plants, invertebrates, and microbes and serve many other ecological functions (Viana et al., 2016). In recent decades, the migratory timing of migratory birds has shifted on a continental scale and climate change is an important factor in this change (Horton et al., 2020; Youngﬂesh et al., 2021). In order to fully understand these changes, we need effective methods for modeling bird mi- gration. There are various sources of data that can be used to model migration. Individual bird tracks are a useful source of data but they are not generally available in large quantities and they are expensive to collect. Weather radar can be pro- cessed in order to infer bird density, ﬂight speed, and ﬂight direction, and this kind of data has been used recently in a ﬂuid dynamics model (Nussbaumer et al., 2021). However, processing the radar data can be difﬁcult and it does not identify the species of bird. One of the largest sources of data is eBird, which is a citizen science project that aggre- gates the observations of recreational birders (Sullivan et al., *Equal contribution1University of Massachusetts, Amherst 2Cornell University.

Abundance map from eBird Project for the American Woodcock 2009). This data is readily available on a species level but it does not include ﬂight speed or direction, so the dynamics approaches are not applicable to this data. Our method uses the abundance maps generated by the eBird project to infer a distribution of bird trajectories. 2. Data We use weekly modeled species abundance estimated de- rived from eBird data (Fink et al., 2020) to infer population movement over time. The abundance model takes into ac- count sources of bias in the citizen science data to produce a weekly estimate of abundance for many bird species. Abun- dance refers to the number of birds of a species that an observer will see at a location within a given amount of time. An example of one of these weekly abundance maps for the American Woodcock ( Scolopax minor ) can be seen in Figure 1. We treat a bird’s position during these weekly snapshots as discrete random variables X1;:::;X Tover the grid cells in the map. In order to use the abundance model as a “ground truth” distribution, we aggregate the abundance to a coarser grid and normalize it so that is sums to one. We will refer to these “ground truth” distributions as p\u0003(Xt)for the weeks t2[1;:::;T ].3. Method We present a fully differentiable parameterization of the single time-step and transition marginals of an arbitrary Markov chain, and develop a loss function of those marginals to infer the ﬂow of birds through different spatial locations. 3.1. Model In order to simplify the migration model, we will assume that a bird’s trajectory is Markovian. This means that the bird’s position one week only depends on the position the week before. While this is not a perfect assumption, pa- rameterizing the full distribution p(X1;:::;X T)without this assumption would require exponentially many parameters inT. So, we parameterize the model as follows: Initial Parameters: Z(1)2Rn; Transition Parameters: Z(t;t+1)2Rn\u0002n: Here,nis the number of cells in the map. In order to go from unconstrained parameters to a distribution we use the softmax function. \u001b(z)i=exp( zi)Pn j=1exp( zj) This ensures the entries are non-negative and sum to one.

It will be convenient to represent these distri- butions as vectors and matrices: \u0016t(i) =pZ(Xt=i); Tt;t+1(i;j) =pZ(Xt+1=jjXt=i): From these distributions, we can infer the weekly marginal distributions and the joint distributions over subsequent weeks from the model. \u0016T\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Introduction\n\nBird migration is a significant ecological phenomenon. Migrating birds act as long-distance dispersal agents for many other species of plants, invertebrates, and microbes, and they serve various ecological functions (Viana et al., 2016). In recent decades, the migratory timing of migratory birds has shifted on a continental scale, and climate change is a key factor in this change (Horton et al., 2020; Young et al., 2021). To fully understand these changes, we need effective methods for modeling bird migration. There are various sources of data that can be used to model migration. Individual bird tracks are a useful source of data but are not generally available in large quantities and are expensive to collect. Weather radar can be processed to infer bird density, flight speed, and flight direction, and this type of data has been used in a fluid dynamics model (Nussbaumer et al., 2021). However, processing the radar data can be difficult, and it does not identify the species of bird. One of the largest sources of data is eBird, a citizen science project that aggregates the observations of recreational birders (Sullivan et al., 2009). This data is readily available on a species level but does not include flight speed or direction, so dynamic approaches are not applicable to this data. Our method uses the abundance maps generated by the eBird project to infer a distribution of bird trajectories.\n\n2. Data\n\nWe use weekly modeled species abundance estimated from eBird data (Fink et al., 2020) to infer population movement over time. The abundance model takes into account sources of bias in the citizen science data to produce a weekly estimate of abundance for many bird species. Abundance refers to the number of birds of a species that an observer will see at a location within a given amount of time. An example of one of these weekly abundance maps for the American Woodcock (Scolopax minor) can be seen in Figure 1. We treat a bird's position during these weekly snapshots as discrete random variables X1,..., XT over the grid cells in the map. To use the abundance model as a \"ground truth\" distribution, we aggregate the abundance to a coarser grid and normalize it so that it sums to one. We will refer to these \"ground truth\" distributions as p(Xt) for the weeks t = 1,..., T.\n\n3. Method\n\nWe present a fully differentiable parameterization of the single time-step and transition marginals of an arbitrary Markov chain, and develop a loss function for those marginals to infer the flow of birds through different spatial locations.\n\n3.1. Model\n\nTo simplify the migration model, we assume that a bird's trajectory is Markovian. This means that the bird's position one week only depends on the position the week before. While this is not a perfect assumption, parameterizing the full distribution p(X1,..., XT) without this assumption would require exponentially many parameters in T. So, we parameterize the model as follows: Initial Parameters: Z(1) ∈ Rn; Transition Parameters: Z(t, t+1) ∈ Rn × n, where n is the number of cells in the map. To go from unconstrained parameters to a distribution, we use the softmax function. \u001b(z)i = exp(zi) / ∑j exp(zj). This ensures the entries are non-negative and sum to one. Applying it to our parameters gives us the following distributions: pZ(X1 = i) = \u001b(Z(1))i; pZ(Xt+1 = j | Xt = i) = \u001b(Z(t, t+1)i)j. Note that Z(t, t+1)i refers to the i-th row of the matrix Z(t, t+1). It will be convenient to represent these distributions as vectors and matrices: \u0016t(i) = pZ(Xt = i); Tt, t+1(i, j) = pZ(Xt+1 = j | Xt = i). From these distributions, we can infer the weekly marginal distributions and the joint distributions over subsequent weeks from the model."
