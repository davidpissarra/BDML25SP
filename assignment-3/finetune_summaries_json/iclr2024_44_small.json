One central application is predictive maintenance to increase efficiency and lower electricity costs by reducing downtimes. Integrating physics-based knowledge in neural networks to enforce their physical plausibilty is a promising method to improve current approaches, but incomplete system in- formation often impedes their application in real world scenarios. We describe a simple and efficient way for physics-constrained deep learning-based predictive maintenance for wind turbine gearbox bearings with partial system knowledge. The approach is based on temperature nowcasting constrained by physics, where unknown system coefficients are treated as learnable neural network parameters. Results show improved generalization performance to unseen environments com- pared to a baseline neural network, which is especially important in low data scenarios often encountered in real-world applications. 1 I NTRODUCTION Machine learning (ML) methods are a crucial part of the wind energy sector (Marugán et al., 2018) and help improving operational efficiency of wind power plants to make electricity prices competitive with currently dominant fossil-based energy sources (Shafiee & Sørensen, 2019). Predictive maintenance is applied to prevent component failures and increase maintenance efficiency. Models of component deterioration processes estimate when maintenance should be performed before damages occur, resulting in shorter downtimes. For large wind farms and those with restricted access such as offshore plants, maintenance is costly and time consuming (Carroll et al., 2017). Optimized maintenance scheduling is thus highly desired, with estimated reductions in the Levelized Cost of Electricity of up to 30% for onshore wind farms (Costa et al., 2021). Especially gearbox faults, mainly caused by bearing failure, can lead to long downtimes (Hahn et al., 2007; Reder et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2020). The core of predictive maintenance is a surrogate model - either data-driven or physics-based - that describes the system in normal conditions. Deviations between this baseline and current measurements triggers an alarm. The system dynamics are often only partially known, making physics-based models difficult to adapt to each scenario when system-specific measurements are not available, while data driven methods don’t guarantee physical plausibility. The integration of physical laws in ML models known as physics-informed ML (PIML) (Karniadakis et al., 2021) allows to combine both approaches. In this paper, we describe a neural network-based approach for predictive maintenance of a wind turbine generator (WTG) gearbox bearing constrained by physics without the need for precise measurements of component coefficients, which are treated as trainable parameters12.

This approach shows competitive prediction performance and improved generalization capabilities in comparison to a physics-based model and a baseline neural network. The approach is not limited to WTGs, but applicable to a wide range of systems where partially known physics-based knowledge can be integrated in the modelling process. 2 M ODEL DESCRIPTION We apply a common procedure of ML-based predictive maintenance: a surrogate model trained on observations represents the expected system behavior in normal conditions. Over the system’s lifetime, the deviations between estimated and true behavior are expected to increase with growing wear of the components, providing information about the condition of the system and potential need for maintenance. Our approach aims to circumvent common problems in ML-based predictive maintenance for WTGs. First, data on system faults is usually scarce - WTGs have availability rates in the order of 98% (Yang et al., 2013); component faults are rare and occur mostly at the end of a component lifetime period. This limits the applicability of fault detection methods. Second, ML models leveraging physics often require knowledge of specific component coefficients (e.g. Yucesan & Viana, 2022). This information is often not available or unreliable, as components like the gearbox vary even between WTGs of the same model. Treating these unknown coefficients as trainable parameters allows to incorporate physics into the model when they are not or only partially known, simplifying the adaptation of this approach to other applications. Third, wind speed is the main driver of bearing temperatures in WTGs, making component temperature prediction mainly a wind speed forecasting problem. Local wind speeds are very difficult to predict also for short time horizons of several minutes due to complex local turbulence patterns. As we focus on nowcasting, i.e. the estimation of the current bearing temperature state, the current rotor speed as the main driver is known. This allows us to avoid the large factor of uncertainty associated with wind speed forecasts and increases prediction performance during periods where wind speed and power production are un\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
