In this work we study the efﬁciency of convolutional models, and speciﬁcally the WaveNet model in forecasting one-day ahead river levels. We show that the additional beneﬁt of the WaveNet model is the computational ease with which other input features can be included in the predictions of river stage and river ﬂow. The conditional WaveNet models outperformed conditional LSTM models for river level prediction by capturing short-term, non-linear dependencies between input data. Furthermore, the Wavenet model offers a faster computation time, stable results and more possibilities for ﬁne-tuning. Introduction Due to climate change, there is an increasing occurrence of ﬂoods and droughts affecting river lev- els which poses a danger to human life, infrastructure and results in signiﬁcant economic and social losses. Accordingly, accurate river level forecasts are needed for early warning systems of ﬂoods and ﬂood mitigation, as well as the management of environment, infrastructure and shipping [11, 2]. River levels like the stage, the water height, and the ﬂow rate are frequently measured along the river and can be estimated in forecasts. However, it is difﬁcult to produce accurate river level forecasts because river levels are the result of complex, dynamic processes of the hydrological cycle. They are affected by many factors that determine water runoff into rivers such as topography, soil char- acteristics, land usage or snowmelt. Therefore river levels display large variations over time with a strong noise component, seasonality and a high degree of non-linearity. These characteristics pose challenges and uncertainty in parameter estimates to forecasting models [17]. Classical approaches for river level forecasting make use of historical time-series or river level re- lated variables. Physically-based methods are hydrodynamic models. They attempt to model the mathematical process underlying the hydrological cycle using physical laws [15]. Hydrodynamic models require large amounts of input data, that can be difﬁcult to obtain (i.e. topography or river geometry), need a long time to run and are prone to errors [19, 6]. A classical data-driven alternative are the auto-regressive (AR) models [10, 4]. However, they fail to capture the non-linear dynamics in river levels and are therefore outperformed by neural networks in river level forecasting [13]. Feedforward fully-connected neural networks can only access a small number of past time points for their predictions. They have been shown to struggle with generalisability on the test set and under- prediction of values, because of the low occurrence of extreme events [1, 10, 7]. These models are also not able to encode temporal or sequential patterns of a time-series. The current gold-standard for time-series predictions is the LSTM, a recurrent neural network, which is specialised for this Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.task; LSTM models have produced impressive results for river level forecasting, outperforming other models in forecasting one day ahead ﬂow rates based on historical time-series of ﬂow and catchment rainfall [11]. One of the challenges of RNNs and LSTMs is their training process which suffers from vanishing gradients and hampers learning long-time dependencies. Additionally they are not built to separately process conditional inputs. As an alternative to RNNs in time-series forecasting, convolutional neu- ral networks (CNNs) have been proposed. While CNNs are known for their application to image classiﬁcation, they can be applied to sequence learning as well [9, 5]. CNNs can make use of par- allelisation and weight sharing among ﬁlters, resulting in enhanced computational efﬁciency, easier training and their ability to process long sequences. A speciﬁc CNN called WaveNet was developed for audio generation purposes [14]. The Wavenet model’s architecture (see Figure 1) can access a broad history of data through dilated causal convolutions. It is able to identify short-term and long-term dependencies through its specialised residual block architecture and parameterised skip connections. Importantly, the Wavenet allows to handle additional inputs to condition its output. Because of the Wavenet’s demonstrated ability to learn dependencies in the data at different scales in audio signals, it suggested itself to be useful in various applications in time-series forecasting problems [16, 3, 18, 20]. In this work, we assess the applicability and performance of a WaveNet-like network for single-step river level time-series forecasting by benchmarking it against the LSTM network and conclude that WaveNet models can be the new state-of-the-art in river level forecasts.
