Due to the lack of centralized data, remote sensing of rooftop PV installations is the best option to monitor the evolution of the rooftop PV installed fleet at a regional scale. However, current techniques lack reliability and are notably sensitive to shifts in the acquisition conditions. To overcome this, we leverage the wavelet scale attribution method (WCAM) [ 21], which decomposes a model’s prediction in the space-scale domain. The WCAM enables us to assess on which scales the representation of a PV model rests and provides insights to derive methods that improve the robustness to acquisition conditions, thus increasing trust in deep learning systems to encourage their use for the safe integration of clean energy in electric systems. 1 Introduction Photovoltaic (PV) energy grows rapidly and is crucial for the decarbonization of electric systems [11]. The rapid growth of rooftop PV makes the estimation of the global PV installed capacity challenging as centralized data is often lacking [ 22]. Remote sensing rooftop PV on orthoimagery with computer vision models is a promising solution for mapping rooftop PV installations. However, current approaches lack reliability and generalize poorly from one image provider to the other [ 45,18]. Improving generalizability and reliability requires improving the robustness to acquisition conditions and proposing methods to assess the reliability of the decision process of the PV classifiers [5]. Deep learning-based pipelines became the standard method for remote sensing PV systems. DeepSolar [48] paved the way for country-wide mapping of PV systems using deep learning and overhead imagery. While several works discuss the poor generalizability of current methods [ 45,7,18], these works do not tackle the robustness to varying acquisition conditions, which can be assimilated to image corruptions [13]. In this work, we analyze the robustness to heterogeneous acquisition conditions of models for remote sensing of PV installations using the wavelet scale attribution method (WCAM, [ 21]). The WCAM assesses the reliability of a model’s decision by decomposing it into the scale-space domain. We analyze the model’s sensitivity to acquisition conditions using the WCAM and derive a principled method for improving the robustness to these acquisition conditions. Our work shows that the WCAM provides a finer understanding of what the model sees as a PV panel and guides us to improve the robustness to acquisition conditions. By improving the reliability and robustness of deep learning models for rooftop PV mapping, we aim to facilitate the mapping and, thus, the integration into the electric grid of rooftop PV. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2 Related works Remote sensing of PV installations Many works leveraged overhead imagery and deep learning methods to map PV installations [ 31,29,9,49]. The DeepSolar [ 48] method marked a significant milestone with mapping distributed and utility-scale installations over the continental United States using state-of-the-art deep learning models. Many works built on DeepSolar to map regions or countries, especially in Europe [ 24,1,22,7,32,33]. However, current methods cannot be transposed from one region to another without incurring accuracy drops, thus limiting their practical usability [18] due to a lack of reliability of the generated data [ 5]. To address this gap, we propose to study and mitigate the impact of acquisition conditions, ubiquitous with overhead imagery, which prevents reusing trained models for registry updates. Sensitivity to distribution shifts The sensitivity to distribution shifts [ 25] prevents from using pre-trained models without further training, whether temporally or spatially, i.e., it limits their ability to generalize [ 5,30]. Some works empirically discussed this issue [ 45] and argued that the generalization ability depended on how hard to recognize the PV panels are. However, no work properly disentangled the effect of each source of variability identified by [ 42]: geographical conditions, varying acquisition conditions, and the ground sampling distance (GSD). Frequency-centric explanations A line of works aimed at explaining the behavior of neural networks through the lenses of frequency analysis. Several works showed that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are biased towards high frequencies [ 44,47] and that robust methods tend to limit this bias [ 51,2]. Other works highlighted a so-called spectral bias [ 37,46,20], showing that CNNs learn the input frequencies from the lowest to the highest. More recently, using wavelet transforms, [21] expanded attribution methods from the pixel to the space-scale (wavelet) domain. This work connects the fields of interpretability and robustness and enables understanding what models see on images. It has not yet been applied to orthoimagery, where scales are explicitly indexed. 3 Data and methods 3.1 Data We consider the crowdsourced training dataset Base de données d’apprentissage profond photo- voltaique (BDAPPV, [ 23]).
