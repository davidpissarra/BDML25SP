Recently, deep-learning-based models have shown great promise in closing the gap with numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in terms of precipitation forecast skill, opening up exciting new avenues for precipitation modeling. However, it is challenging for these deep learning models to fully resolve the fine-scale structures of precipitation phenomena and adequately characterize the extremes of the long- tailed precipitation distribution. In this work, we present several improvements to the architecture and training process of a current state-of-the art deep learning precipitation model (FourCastNet) using a novel generative adversarial network (GAN) to better capture fine scales and extremes. Our improvements achieve superior performance in capturing the extreme percentiles of global precipitation, while comparable to state-of-the-art NWP models in terms of forecast skill at 1–2 day lead times. Together, these improvements set a new state-of-the-art in global precipitation forecasting. 1 Introduction Precipitation is a fundamental climate phenomenon with major impact on crucial infrastructure such as food, water, energy, transportation, and health systems [ 1]. On timescales relevant to weather prediction, making accurate forecasts of precipitation and extreme events is critical to the planning and management of these systems, along with disaster preparedness for extreme precipitation events, which are greatly amplified by climate change [ 2]. Unfortunately, extreme precipitation remains one of the most challenging atmospheric phenomena to forecast accurately, due to high spatiotemporal variability and the myriad of complex multi-scale, multi-phase processes that govern its behavior [3–5]. State-of-the-art NWP models, such as the Integrated Forecast System1(IFS), produce operational forecasts by combining physics-based PDE solvers with assimilated observations from a variety 1https://www.ecmwf.int/en/forecasts/documentation-and-support Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.of sources. The complexity of moisture physics requires many parameterizations in these models for processes like turbulent mixing, convection, subgrid clouds and microphysics [ 6], and such parameterizations can lead to large biases in NWP precipitation forecasts [ 7]. As a result, global precipitation forecasts generally achieve inadequate forecast skill [ 5] and, hence, there has been an increasing interest in fully data-driven solutions, primarily using deep learning, in recent years. Data-driven models can be orders of magnitude faster with the potential to learn complex parameteri- zations between input and output function spaces directly from data, reducing model bias. With such models, major advances have been made in the area of precipitation “nowcasting”, where forecasts are made over limited spatial regions with lead times on the order of minutes to hours. Deep learning models trained directly on radar and/or satellite observations now outperform traditional methods for nowcasting [ 8–10]. However, until recently, there has been limited progress for models predicting precipitation at larger spatiotemporal scales (e.g., over the full globe up to days in advance), mainly due to computational limitations on resolution [ 11]. FourCastNet [ 12] is the first deep-learning-based global weather model running at ∼30km scale, which outperforms IFS in terms of precipitation forecast skill up to ∼2 day lead times and is the current state-of-the-art. However, despite using a dedicated network just for precipitation due to its unique challenges, FourCastNet predictions still lack fine-scale details (see Figure 1) and thus underestimate the extreme percentiles of the precipitation distribution. In this work, we aim to overcome some of these limitations using generative models to advance the state-of-the-art in deep learning-based precipitation forecasts. In particular, our contributions are as follows: (i) we apply a state-of-the-art generative adversarial network [ 13] that integrates multi-scale semantic structure and style information, allowing us to synthesize physically realistic fine-scale precipitation features; (ii) we show that capturing fine-scale phenomena leads to improved predictions of extreme precipitation while also preserving forecast skill, attaining comparable skill at 1–2 lead day times with respect to IFS. 2 Methods 2.1 Dataset We replicate the data preparation pipeline of the original FourCastNet precipitation model [ 12], relying on the European Center for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (ECMWF) global reanalysis dataset ERA5 [ 14], which combines archived atmospheric observations with physical model outputs. Following FourCastNet’s time steps of length 6 hours, we model the 6hr accumulated total precipita- tionTP(this also makes for easier comparisons against IFS, which archives TPforecasts in 6 hourly accumulations as well). A sample snapshot of TP, in log-normalized units for easy visualization of fine-scale details, is shown in the bottom-right inset of Figure 1. We use the years 1979-2015 and 2016-2017 as training and validation sets, respectively, and set aside 2018 as a test set. We refer the reader to the original FourCastNet paper [12\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
