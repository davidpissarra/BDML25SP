Although computer vision models have shown promise for efficient and automated plant disease identification, there are limitations for real-world applications: a notable variation in visual symptoms of a single disease, different light and weather conditions, and the complexity of the models. In this work, we study the performance of efficient classification models and training “tricks” to solve this problem. Our analysis represents a plausible solution for these ecological disasters and might help to assist producers worldwide.

Their rapid identification remains difficult, particularly in parts of the world that lack the necessary resources. This can sometimes trigger serious environmental disasters that severely affect the economy.

In terms of value, Apple ( Malus domestica Borkh. 1803) is one of the most economically important fruit crops in the world; in the US $15 billion annually [ 19]. Apple production is heavily affected by a wide range of pests and diseases including mites, aphids, stink bug, european sawfly, etc. Early and accurate disease detection is critical for management in orchards, not least because pesticide (over-)use has negative environmental impact. Recent advances in machine learning and computer vision (CV) paired with universal and global access to smartphones lead a clear way towards low-cost plant disease diagnosis in the wild. The potential impact of an efficient smartphone implementation of such technology is immeasurable. Although CV models have shown promising results for efficient plant disease detection [ 23,19,12], there are many factors which complicate the design of such a tool e.g., multiple diseases are present in an image, small datasets, and noisy inputs (light and shade variations, non-uniform backgrounds).

Since 2016, deep learning and computer vision approaches have been used in many agriculture problems such as automated plant species identification and phenotyping [ 2] and plant pathology recognition [ 1], among others.
