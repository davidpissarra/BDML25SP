Thanks to the large amount of satellite data available, it is now possible to understand GHGs’ behaviours at a broad scale. However, due to remote sensing devices technological limitations, the task of global high resolution (HR) monitoring remains an open problem. To avoid waiting for new missions and better data to be generated, it is therefore relevant to experiment with processing methods able to improve existing datasets. Our paper proposes to apply Super Resolution (SR), a Deep Learning (DL) approach commonly used in Computer Vision (CV), on global L3 satellite data. We produce a daily high resolution global CO 2dataset that opens the door for globally consistent point source monitoring. 1 I NTRODUCTION AND MOTIVATIONS According to the sixth IPCC report, GHGs are responsible for an increase of the global surface tem- perature of over 1°since 1850-1900 (Core Writing Team et al.). Amongst GHGs, the report high- lights the predominant role played by CO 2and CH 4. Accurately understanding the emission process of GHGs can lead to more impactful decision making and actions to reduce global warming. Ac- cordingly, emission datasets have been compiled by aggregating estimations and reports (Climate TRACE coalition, 2022; European Environment Agency, 2023). Besides, daily monitoring allows for emissions tracking (Nassar et al., 2021). A global HR daily GHG monitoring dataset could there- fore help validate and complete these inventories. Unfortunately, remote sensing satellite imagery is either sparse and incomplete, as it will be generated following the swath of the satellite (Earth Science Data Systems, NASA, 2016), or possesses limited spatial or temporal resolution when pro- cessed to produce global maps. Studies have shown that machine learning methods can help over- come part of these limitations (He et al., 2022). The work described in this paper focuses on CO 2 monitoring and brings the following contributions: • We apply SR to the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) L3 dataset to generate HR global maps of column-averaged dry air mole fraction of atmospheric CO2 (XCO2). The framework can be transferred to other GHGs and is not specific to CO 2. • We introduce a new HR dataset with a resolution of 0.03°*0.04°. This dataset offers the possibility to perform global XCO2 monitoring consistently. • We show that our method does not introduce noise compared to the original Low Reso- lution (LR) dataset and offers a quantitative improvement in performance over alternative methods. 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024 2 R ELATED WORKS Different methods have been used to produce global mapping datasets of XCO2. Statistical meth- ods rely on interpolation to fill the gaps left by satellite-observed XCO2. Kriging interpolation and its variations compose the majority of the literature done following this approach (He et al., 2020; Zammit-Mangion et al., 2018; Bhattacharjee & Chen, 2020). Chemical Transport Model (CTM) simulations constitute a branch of statistical physics-informed methods to generate complete global data on XCO2, and in particular fluxes (Jacobson et al., 2023; Pillai & Neininger, 2012). The com- putational cost of these simulations unfortunately restricts the resolution of the global maps to coarse resolution. Other paradigms involve the fusion of multiple sensor’s data in order to start with a more comprehensive covered area and therefore reduce the uncertainty of the generated maps (Wang et al., 2023).
