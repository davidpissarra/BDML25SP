This paper proposes a multi- agent reinforcement learning framework for managing energy transactions in microgrids. The framework addresses the challenges above: it seeks to optimize the usage of available resources by minimizing the carbon footprint while benefiting all stakeholders. The proposed architecture consists of three layers of agents, each pursuing different objectives. The first layer, comprised of prosumers and consumers, minimizes the total energy cost. The other two layers control the energy price to decrease the carbon impact while balancing the consumption and production of both renewable and conventional energy. This framework also takes into account fluctuations in energy demand and supply. 1 Introduction As technology and urban areas continue to grow, the demand for energy increases and is expected to continue to be high. Because of this, the world is moving towards greener options, increasing the demand for renewable energy from industry and residential consumers Leibowicz et al. (2018). Between renewable energies, we have solar, wind, tidal, hydropower, and bio-energy. The challenge behind lays not only in the generation but guaranteeing there is enough to supply the demand since the generation of renewable energy is inherently stochastic (depends on multiple climate factors). There is a need to adapt to the randomness of the situation, which can be solved by creating specific energy systems controlled by machine learning models, which optimize the usage of the available resources Vázquez-Canteli et al. (2019). For example, the concept of “smart transactive grids” has been proposed to organize the demand and production of energy in communities. The idea is to create an intelligent system that uses different energy sources to supply the demand with minimal human intervention. At the same time, it provides the opportunity to sell any surplus energy produced. Some previous work leveraged Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create technologies that enable transactive microgrids. In Anvari-Moghaddam et al. (2017), an approach using different RL agents is proposed, where the distributions of agents are different: one agent is used for particular computation (e.g., optimization), called Service Agent; the other two agents collect meteorological information, and forecast the power output based on the specified type of energy (solar, wind, etc.). In the design of its energy management system, one battery is shared across the residential households, and all the agents communicate with a “central ∗These authors contributed equally to this work. 1coordinator agent”. In Vazquez-Canteli et al. (2020), the authors proposed a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) approach consisting of agents sharing two variables and following a leader-follower schema to manage energy demand and generation. They also proposed a specific reward function with greedy and collective goals to incentivize the agents to work together as a community. Other MARL approaches could be relevant to solve similar issues. In COLA Xu et al. (2022), a consensus learning approach is proposed, which is inspired by the DINO (Distillation with No Labels) Caron et al. (2021). In DINO’s method, a student network is created to predict the teacher network results to simplify the self-supervised training process for methods that (originally) require centralized training and decentralized inference. Authors of Foerster et al. (2017) proposed the Counterfactual Multi-Agent (COMA) policy gradients. In this work, they propose an architecture with a centralized critic to estimate the action-value function and decentralized actors to learn the optimal policy for each agent. The main innovation in this approach is introducing a counterfactual baseline that allows each agent to compare its current action contribution to the global reward with all the other possible actions. This is a way to deal with the problem of credit assignment in the multi-agent context, which happens when the agents do not consider their contribution to a collaborative objective. This paper proposes and develops a Multi-Agent Hierarchical Framework for Transactive Mi- crogrids (MAHTM). The framework considers the minimization of the carbon footprint during the multi-agent learning process to tackle the challenges of climate change. 2 Methods We propose a three-layer hierarchical RL architecture, as shown in Figure. 1. Each layer owns a set of agents with different objectives, pursued greedily. In our framework, we denote a set of Gmicrogrids as M={m1, m2,..., m i,..., m G}; we denote a group of Dihouseholds belonging to a microgrid iasHi={hi,1, hi,2,..., h i,j,..., h i,Di}, the current time step is denoted as t.
