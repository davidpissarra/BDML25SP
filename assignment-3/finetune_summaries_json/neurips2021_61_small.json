For a case study storm event in December 2013 we ﬁnd that all models over-predict ﬂood extents, but that the machine learning model extents were closest to those observed. 1 Introduction Climate change-driven global sea-level rise increases the risk of coastal ﬂooding through higher return frequencies of coastal water levels during storms. Although the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report found limited evidence for an increase in storminess due to climate change, measurable regional rises in mean sea level have already led to increases in the frequency of inundation (IPCC 2014). The most recent climate change risk assessment for the UK projects winter weather will be dominated by more mobile cyclonic systems which cause coastal ﬂooding, exacerbated by 5-10cm higher rises in sea levels than previously projected (Betts, Pearson 2021). Coastal ﬂooding is a substantial climate change concern for both societal and economic impacts: a signiﬁcant fraction of global infrastructure (power plants, ports, housing, road and rail) is located at the coast, and, a combination of sea-level rise, changes in storm surge intensity and land subsidence combined with economic growth pose immense threats to coastal and low-lying communities (Oddo et al. 2020). There is consequently demand for better quantiﬁcation of coastal ﬂood risk for current and future climates across multiple industries and the public sector. Coastal ﬂood risk quantiﬁcation poses numerous challenges, including substantial modelling uncer- tainties and the computational intensity of physical simulation models for storm surge and inundation, which limit both the resolution and extent over which they can be applied. In this paper we will address the latter component, and consider the suitability of computationally \"lightweight\" approaches to derive inundation from water levels and geospatial features for coastal ﬂood risk mapping at the country scale, a particular requirement for industry sectors such as transport, energy and utilities who operate across large geographic domains. The increase in data availability in the ﬁeld of environmental sciences has led to the emergence of data-driven models to represent complex physical processes. Studies have recently shown the use of machine learning (ML) techniques to evaluate the ﬂood susceptibility of an area. Studies so far have mainly focused on ﬂuvial and pluvial ﬂooding rather than coastal ﬂooding and have been limited to smaller regions (Tehrany et al. 2014; Chen et al. 2020; Avand et al. 2021). The aim of this paper is to derive a machine learning model for coastal ﬂood mapping using historical ﬂood records in England. The model will be tested on the December 2013 Storm Xavier event and Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2021compared to a static inundation model to understand the relative strengths and weaknesses of each approach. Our work, which is ongoing, will contribute to improved coastal ﬂood risk quantiﬁcation and climate change resilience across multiple impacted sectors. 2 Data and methods The aim of this study is to use a data-driven approach to estimate extents of coastal ﬂooding. The methodology is summarised in Figure 1. Figure 1: Methodology 2.1 Datasets The variables used in this study to predict coastal ﬂooding include: elevation, slope, aspect, topo- graphic wetness index (TWI), land cover, sea surface height (SSH) and distance to the coast. The elevation, slope, aspect, TWI and land cover variables were selected based on a literature review of ﬂood susceptibility (Avand et al. 2021; Park, Lee 2020). Past studies mainly focus on ﬂuvial and pluvial ﬂooding and include variables such as distance to river and rainfall (Avand et al. 2021). As the focus is here set on coastal ﬂooding the choice of using distance to coast and a SSH is most suited. A historical record of ﬂooding (Environment Agency 2018) was used to generate ﬂooded and non ﬂooded points (5099 points each) as labelling data for the ML model. A description of the variables and preprocessing steps are included in Appendix A. 2.2 Methodology The ﬂooded and non-ﬂooded points were combined into a dataset sorted by date with a 1 assigned to ﬂooded points and 0 to non ﬂooded points.
