In an effort to reduce wildﬁre risk, state and local governments are pushing to manage forests via regular prescribed burning, i.e., controlled, low-temperature burns to reduce the amount of fuel in a forest. Although prescribed burning conducted every few years will reduce wildﬁre risk due to climate change, populations near heavily forested areas will experience frequent smoke episodes. Previous research has observed that smoke produced from different burn conditions or from burning different fuels, such as whole trees and man-made structures in wildﬁres versus ground cover duff in prescribed burns, is chemically distinct [ 1;9]. Speciﬁcally, we have previously demonstrated that burning a speciﬁc shrub, manzanita, can release enormous amounts of a toxic compound known as hydroquinone into the air [ 10]. Other smoke compounds that describe a speciﬁc fuel or burn condition may exist but there is currently no technique that can extract this information from the complex chemical composition. Consequently, current air quality models treat all smoke as composed of about ten common compounds (i.e., produced from burning any vegetation) and overlooks differences between thousands of other compounds [ 20]. The lack of more fuel-speciﬁc smoke information prevents forest managers from developing an effective strategy to reduce climate-induced wildﬁre risk while minimizing air quality damage. A ﬁrst step toward understanding the impact of wildland burns, including wildﬁres and prescribed burns, on air quality is through chemical ﬁngerprinting — laboratory analysis to quantify compounds in collected smoke samples from wildland burns. The output from advanced analytic platforms, such as two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC) and mass spectrometry (MS), is multi-dimensional and contains thousands of chemical compounds [ 5]. Comparing smoke samples and relating ﬁngerprint data to their impacts on air quality, and subsequent exposure toxicity, is also an inherently difﬁcult task because of complex synergism between numerous compounds and the variability in burn conditions. There is an urgent need for machine learning techniques that can differentiate between different types of smoke with interpretable and explainable results. We do not want to limit ourselves to Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.only answering whether two smoke samples are different, but we aim at gaining insight as to how differences (if observed and statistically signiﬁcant) relate to groups of compounds. In this way we can link smoke to fuel, burn conditions, and air quality impacts. In this work, we describe how spectral clustering and manifold learning can provide interpretable representations and powerful tools for differentiating between smoke. The statistical challenge is that the data (such as mass spectra representing chemical compounds) are not only high-dimensional, but that each smoke sample is a weighted set of high-dimensional data. Furthermore, not all mass spectra are equally likely to occur; the underlying physical constraints naturally imply that the spectra, if seen as points in a higher-dimensional space, inherently possess “sparse” low-dimensional structure (clusters, manifolds, etc). The main question is how to design efﬁcient representations and machine learning (ML) algorithms for smoke samples that take sparse structure into account, and that allow us to easily relate ML prediction results back to groups of chemical compounds. Here we present a new geometry-based metric between smokes as distributions over chemical compounds, which can serve as input to kernel ML and visualization algorithms. 2 Data Our research team collected a total of 54 prescribed burn smoke samples at ground level and above the forest canopy (\u0018100 m in the air).
