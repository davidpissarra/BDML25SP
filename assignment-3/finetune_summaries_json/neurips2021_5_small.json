But in the past two decades, fully data-driven (empirical) models started to emerge with the breakthroughs of novel deep learning methods in runoff prediction. These breakthroughs were mostly favored by the large volume, variety and velocity of water-related data.

This performance matches those of well-known physically-based models used to simulate Niamey’s discharge and therefore demonstrates the efficiency of deep learning methods in a West African context, especially in Niamey which has been facing severe floods due to climate change. Keywords: Ansongo-Niamey basin, deep learning, gated recurrent unit, hydrological model, hyperpa- rameter optimization, long short-term memory 1 Introduction According to Aich et al. (2016), in the Niger Basin (particularly in the Middle Niger Basin), extensive catastrophic flooding has increased drastically during the last two decades, with a high frequency and at large extent in the city of Niamey. As part of possible mitigation solutions, finding means to improve hydrological models could alleviate the suffering of the population by improving the existing early warning systems. Many hydrological models have been deployed to predict the discharge in Niamey. The models studied were physically-based hydrological models such as the Niger-HYdrological Predictions for the Environment (Niger-HYPE) by Andersson et al. (2017), Interaction between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere-Total Runoff Integrating Pathway (ISBA-TRIP) by Casse (2015), Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) by Pomeon et al. (2018) and HydroGeoSphere (HGS) by Boko et al. (2020). Few hydrological models have performed well in Niamey at discharge prediction ∗Email: adounkpep@gmail.com Codes related to article on GitHub: https://github.com/pyaj0/DL-hydrological-model Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.(section 5). Artificial intelligence (AI) AI based models which are fully data driven appear to be able to overcome deficiencies of physically-based hydrological models (Shen (2018)). In hydrology, deep learning (DL) is a subset of machine learning well known for predicting and estimating floods, monitoring drought accurately, analyzing atmospheric imaging, estimating tropical cyclones and their precursors, and predicting other hydrological processes (Ardabili et al. (2019)). Hochreiter and Schmidhuber (1997), the creators of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, proved that their recurrent neural network structure was an innovative DL method for achieving high accuracy time series prediction and reducing CPU cost. Due to their cell state, LSTMs can learn and store long-term dependencies of the input-output relationship. The Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) is an improved version of the LSTM proposed by Chung et al. (2014) and able to outperform its predecessor. Furthermore, Shen (2018) demonstrates that DL can help address several major new and old challenges facing research in water science, and hydrological modeling is no exception. Intending to look for alternative hydrological models to better face climate change damages, this study focuses on simulating efficiently the Niger river discharge in the city of Niamey using artificial neural networks. The methodology followed includes (i) preprocessing climate and hydrological data, (ii) optimizing LSTM and GRU hyperparameters, and (iii) training and testing the DL models. The following sections progressively explore the study conducted by depicting the area of study, describing the data used, sharing the methods and techniques deployed and discussing the results obtained. 2 Study Area The Ansongo-Niamey basin is a transborder catchment located in the middle region of the Niger basin between Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Ansongo (Mali) - the outlet of the upper Niger basin - was considered the upstream of this study area. The Ansongo-Niamey basin was chosen as study area because it would prove challenging to collect data of the upper Niger basin. This basin’s runoff regime is affected by recurring floods which flow from different geographic locations with distinct characteristics. The first flood is the annual peak during the rainy season (July to November) in the Ansongo-Niamey basin called the “Red Flood”\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
