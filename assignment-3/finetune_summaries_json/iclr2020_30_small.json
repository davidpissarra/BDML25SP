Large portion of the indigenous vocabulary and knowledge remains unknown or is slowly disappearing. There is a need to build a glossary of terms regarding environment and climate change in the vernacular to improve the dialog regarding climate change and environmen- tal protection. We believe that ML has a role to play in closing the ’vocabulary gap’ of terms and concepts regarding the environment and climate change that exists in Chichewa and other Malawian languages by helping to creating a visual dictionary of key terms used to describe the environment and explain the issues in- volved in climate change and their meaning. Chichewa is a descriptive language, one English term may be translated using several words. Thus, the task is not to detect just literal translations, but also translations by means of ‘descriptions’ and illustrations and thus extract correspondence between terms and deﬁnitions and to measure how appropriate a term is to convey the meaning intended. As part of this project, the identiﬁcation of ‘loanword patterns’ into Chichewa from other languages such as English, may be useful in understanding the transmission of cultural items. 1 S OME RELEVANT LANGUAGE ISSUES IN MALAWI Chichewa, with its geographical dialects, is the language of about half of Malawians, spoken both in rural and urban places. Other notable languages are Chiyao and Tumbuka, Chilomwe and Chisena. From 1907 to 1964, Malawi was a British protectorate and the education in the country was in the hands of the Christian missionaries with small governmental input. Missionaries taught English, but at the same time they engaged in learning the local language, conducting signiﬁcant linguistic work (e.g., writing the ﬁrst dictionaries and grammatical rules) and engaging in the translation of the Bible in the main local languages of Chichewa, Yao and Tumbuka. Over the years and more signiﬁcantly, after Malawi became a Republic in 1964, the government assumed a more active role in education by opening schools, and offering universal primary education. Malawi’s primary school education shifted towards using Chichewa as the language of instruction. Chichewa was designated a national language alongside English, the latter was used for ofﬁcial and business matters. In secondary schools and higher education, English is used in teaching and learning. The language policy in Malawi education has been an issue of debate, with some arguing that the use of the native vernacular will improve children’s learning of new concepts, while others arguing that the need for ‘language switching’ (mainly between English and Chichewa) in classrooms brings tensions and pressures especially in the teaching of abstract and science subjects (Kaphesi (2003)). Others brought special attention to a worrying ‘vocabulary gap’ that exists between Chichewa and other ofﬁcial indigenous 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 languages of Malawi (Chiuye & Moyo (2008)). The lack of adequate teaching and learning materials in local languages creates ‘linguistically impoverished and deprived’ learners (Kamwendo (2016)) and there is a need to ‘develop terminologies and a broad lexical base’. This will help in ‘diffusing and refuting stereotype notions that indigenous African languages lack a conceptual framework to express scientiﬁc notions with appropriate scientiﬁc vocabulary’(Chiuye & Moyo (2008)). Studies on the impact of language switching on the teaching of mathematics in schools in Malawi showed that, although teachers had problems in translating and ﬁnding the terminology that best describes some of the mathematical concepts, they did not receive systematic training in the use of language (Kaphesi (2003)). Vernaculars and glossary of terms will help children understand concepts that they would otherwise ﬁnd difﬁcult to understand if taught only in English (Kayambazinthu (1998)). 2 A GROWING VOCABULARY GAP FOR ENVIRONMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE Malawi is a beautiful country with varied ecosystems (e.g., the well known Lake Malawi), grass- lands areas and forests. These ecosystems have seen massive degradation over the years. Efforts to restore the habitat, wild animals and protect the forests have been made by international organ- isations working with the Malawi government (UNESCO (2017)). It is not the purpose of this proposal to discuss all of these, but to emphasise that all these players recognise the need to increase knowledge and awareness about climate change and make it available to school children and their educators.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe majority of people spend most of their time outdoors, but alienation from nature is also occurring, albeit in different ways. A significant portion of indigenous vocabulary and knowledge remains unknown or is slowly disappearing. To improve the dialogue on climate change and environmental protection, there is a need to create a glossary of terms related to the environment and climate change in the vernacular. We believe that machine learning (ML) can play a role in closing the vocabulary gap in Chichewa and other Malawian languages by creating a visual dictionary of key terms used to describe the environment and explain the issues involved in climate change and their meanings.\n\nChichewa is a descriptive language, where one English term can be translated using several words. Therefore, the task is not only to detect literal translations but also to extract correspondence between terms and definitions, and to measure how suitable a term is to convey the intended meaning.
