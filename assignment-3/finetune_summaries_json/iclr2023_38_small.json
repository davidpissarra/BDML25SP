To remove confound- ing factors related to author popularity and minimise noise, they are trained on pairs of tweets that are from the same author and around the same time period and have a sufficiently large difference in engagement. The models achieve good accuracy on a held-out set of pairs. We show that we can interpret the parameters of the trained model to identify the topic and metadata features that contribute to high engagement. Among other observations, we see that topics related to climate projections, human cost and deaths tend to have low engagement while those re- lated to mitigation and adaptation strategies have high engagement. We hope the insights gained from this study will help craft effective climate communication to promote engagement, thereby lending strength to efforts to tackle climate change. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change is arguably one of the most important challenges facing humanity today with im- pacts on a global scale. While surveys indicate that a majority of the population in many countries is now knowledgeable about climate change and its impacts, the level of awareness and support for climate-friendly policies still vary widely among people from different countries, income and education levels and age groups (Leiserowitz et al. (2022), Flynn et al. (2021)). It is important to use communication to spread awareness and promote engagement among the groups that are less involved in order to further increase the scale of actions towards mitigation and adaptation and pres- sure lawmakers and governments to create and enforce climate-friendly laws. There are several subtopics within climate change including its causes, impacts and mitigation and adaptation strategies. The potential to create engagement is likely to be different for each of these subtopics. For instance, complex technical details might be less appealing than vivid descriptions of impacts or promising solutions. Our goal in this work is to discover in a data-driven way which strategies of communication, as defined by the subtopics being emphasised, are more effective in creating engagement among a general audience. The data source that we use for this study is Twitter. Twitter is extensively used for climate change communication by individuals, activist groups, and government agencies. Each tweet is associated with several metrics such as the number of likes,retweets, and replies, that quantify the engagement that it generates. All tweets along with their metadata are publicly available and can be easily accessed through the Twitter API, enabling us to curate a large and rich dataset on which to train interpretable engagement prediction models. However, a significant challenge in building such models is the presence of confounding factors such as author popularity. A tweet might generate strong engagement because its author is popular rather than because of its engaging content. Another potential confounder is the change in public interest in climate change over time. For instance, tweets about climate change made around the time of extreme weather or a major climate change conference might receive greater attention than tweets at other times. We minimise the effect of such confounders by defining the task as comparing 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 the engagement within a pair of tweets rather than predicting the engagement for a given tweet. The pair of tweets are chosen to be from the same author and from the same window in time. Climate change communication is an active area of research and the question of which strategies are best to promote engagement has been well-studied in the area (Agin & Karlsson (2021)). Gustafson et al. (2020) find that sharing personal stories on the radio about the harmful impacts of climate change can be a persuasive strategy. Xia et al. (2021) analyse the spreading behaviour of climate- related tweets and identify the factors responsible for virality from a dataset obtained through manual coding of a small number of tweets. Tweet engagement prediction in general (not restricted to climate change) is also a well-studied problem. Tan et al. (2014) study the effect of wording on engagement by comparing pairs of tweets from the same user about the same topic. More recently, Wang et al. (2018) used multimodal in- formation (images and text) to predict retweet behaviour. Topic modelling (inferring latent topics in text) has been used in Dahal et al. (2019) to understand which topics are prevalent in the global climate change discourse. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to apply topic modelling in a pairwise comparison framework to predict engagement in climate change tweets and interpret the learned model to understand the engaging subtopics.
