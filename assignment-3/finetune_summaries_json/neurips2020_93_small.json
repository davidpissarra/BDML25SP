Despite these impacts, scientiﬁc data and infrastructures are still lacking to understand and quantify the consequences of these perturbations on the marine ecosystem. Understanding this phenomenon is not only an urgent but also a scientiﬁcally de- manding task.

In this proposal paper, we describe our newly launched four-years project focused on developing new artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical modeling tools to contribute to the understanding of the structure, functioning, and underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the global ocean symbiome and its relation with climate change. These actions should enable the understanding of our oceans and predict and mitigate the consequences of climate and biodiversity changes. 1 Introduction Considering the importance and amount of oceans in this speck of dust in the middle of nowhere that we inhabit, we should have called it Planet Ocean. Oceans are not only important because of their volume but are also about the functions and contributions they provide to biodiversity, we included [ 1]. Oceans play a key role in the biosphere, regulating the carbon cycle; absorbing emitted CO 2through the biological pump, and a large part of the heat that the remaining CO 2and other greenhouse gases retained in the atmosphere. The biological pump is driven by photosynthetic microalgae, herbivores, and decomposing bacteria. Whales also play a prominent role by moving nutrients and providing mixing in the ocean [ 2–4]. Understanding the drivers of micro and macroorganisms in the ocean is of paramount importance to understand the functioning of ecosystems and the efﬁciency of the biological pump in sequestering carbon and thus abating climate change. This situation poses a substantial challenge to humanity as a whole. It is not only an urgent but also a scientiﬁcally demanding task. Consequently, it is a problem that must be addressed with a scientiﬁc cohort approach, where multi-disciplinary teams must collaborate to bring the best of different sci- entiﬁc areas: state-of-the-art artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, applied math, modeling, and simulation, and, of course, marine biology and oceanography. They will enable us to understand our oceans and to predict and —hopefully— mitigate the consequences of climate change. Data is essential in this pursuit.
