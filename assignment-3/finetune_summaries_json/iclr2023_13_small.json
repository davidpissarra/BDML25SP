To measure the at- mosphere’s ability to dilute air pollutants, Air Stagnation Index (ASI) has been introduced as an important meteorological index. Therefore, making long-lead ASI forecasts is vital to make plans in advance for air quality management. In this study, we found that autumn Ni ˜no indices derived from sea surface tempera- ture (SST) anomalies show a negative correlation with wintertime ASI in southern China, offering prospects for a prewinter forecast. We developed an LSTM-based model to predict the future wintertime ASI. Results demonstrated that multivariate inputs (past ASI and Ni ˜no indices) achieve better forecast performance than uni- variate input (only past ASI). The model achieves a correlation coefficient of 0.778 between the actual and predicted ASI, exhibiting a high degree of consistency. 1 I NTRODUCTION Air pollution has become a focus problem which various countries are concerned about. The growth of atmospheric contaminants damages vegetation and crops and even is highly related to some se- rious human health diseases (Kampa & Castanas, 2008; Al-Saadi et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2018; Masood & Ahmad, 2021). Apart from direct emissions of air pollutants, meteorological conditions are also important to the accumulation and dispersion of pollutants. Air stagnation occurs usually with descending air, low wind speeds, low precipitation, and the compressed boundary layer, which is favorable for the formation and accumulation of atmospheric contaminants (Wu et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2019). Hence, the Air Stagnation Index (ASI) has been proposed to assess the atmosphere’s ability to dilute air pollutants (Horton et al., 2012; 2014; Huang et al., 2018). Studies have shown that air stagnation highly correlates with the concentrations of air pollutants (Liao et al., 2006; Huang et al., 2018). Therefore, accurate forecasts of ASI are important and valuable for managing air quality and enabling advance planning. However, most existing works usually forecast the next several hours or days of air pollution levels in advance by using common meteorological variables (e.g., wind speed, wind direction, humidity, temperature, and rainfall), ground-level observations, and satellite data, etc (Al-Saadi et al., 2005; Bai et al., 2018; Li et al., 2011; Harishkumar et al., 2020; Ham et al., 2019; Chae et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021; Kurt & Oktay, 2010; Ham et al., 2021; Chang et al., 2020; Wu & Lin, 2019). At present, long-lead seasonal or multi-year air pollution forecasts are still under exploration, because the ability of long-lead forecasts is highly dependent on finding strongly correlated climate factors and appropriate forecast algorithms.
