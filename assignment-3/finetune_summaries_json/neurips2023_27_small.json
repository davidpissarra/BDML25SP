In this work, we aim to understand how real world events influence the opinions of individuals towards climate change related topics on social media. To this end, we extracted and analyzed a dataset of 13.6 millions tweets sent by 3.6 million users from 2006 to 2019. Then, we construct a temporal graph from the user-user mentions network and utilize the Louvain community detection algorithm to analyze the changes in community structure around Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP) events. Next, we also apply tools from the Natural Language Processing literature to perform sentiment analysis and topic modeling on the tweets. Our work acts as a first step towards understanding the evolution of pro-climate change communities around COP events. Answering these questions helps us understand how to raise people’s awareness towards climate change thus hopefully calling on more individuals to join the collaborative effort in slowing down climate change. 1 Introduction Climate change is a widely debated topic, and a significant number of individuals still denies the effect of climate change. Hence, we seek to understand how real-world events would influence opinions regarding climate change on social media platforms. According to a survey by the Pew Research Center, 15% of adults in the US do not believe that the Earth is warming, and 36% believe that it is due to natural causes rather than human activity. The spread of misinformation and propaganda campaigns on social media has contributed to skepticism around climate change [14]. To address these challenges, we aim to analyze the growth or contraction of communities of climate change supporters and non-supporters on social media platforms. This analysis will provide insights into how real-world events such as the Conference of the Parties (COP) events shape public opinion on climate change. By analyzing the patterns of social media interactions and the spread of climate change discourse on social media platforms, effective communication strategies can be developed to promote climate change awareness and counter misinformation campaigns. The stakeholders of this study include policymakers, environmental organizations, and the general public. 2 Background and Related Work Climate Change on Social Media. Social media have created new arenas for public debates and revolutionized the discussion of prominent issues such as global climate change [ 20]. Various research on this topic have been conducted. [ 11] looked into user profile, tweet attitude, discussion Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.topics, and climate phenomenons. [ 2] built a random forest (RF) model to predict people’s attitude towards climate change and environment protection based on psychological and demographic factors. Furthermore, [ 25] modeled the relationship between perceived climate change efficacy and news and user activities on social media by using multilevel regression. Temporal Graph Learning. Social networks can be modeled as a temporal graph where users are nodes and interactions are edges while the nodes and edges in the graph would naturally change over time [ 23,29,28]. The dynamic community detection task which aims to identify groups of individuals who are closely connected to each other on the temporal graph [ 21,7,4,22]. Qin et al. [21] and Boudebza et al. [ 4] both proposed novel methods to detect stable communities, groups of nodes forming a coherent community throughout a period of time. In this work, we first apply the well-know Louvain community detection algorithm [ 3] to identify the growth or contraction of user communities of climate change topics on twitter. Misinformation detection. Misinformation related to climate change is a significant problem that has been widely researched. Several studies have examined the relationship between social media usage, belief in conspiracy theories, and misinformation, highlighting the gravity of the issue [ 12]. The adverse impact of such misinformation has been well-documented, underscoring the importance of inoculating people against misinformation related to climate change [ 18]. Research on debunking strategies has produced mixed results, highlighting the continued influence of misinformation and the need for effective measures [ 17,5]. The identification of psychological factors that drive misinformation and hinder debunking [ 9] indicates the complexity of the issue and the need for targeted interventions to tackle it. Political polarization detection. Political polarization [ 8] is one of the crucial socio-political issues in twenty-first century. It intensifies political debates and may even threaten civil society. [ 8] demonstrated that political polarization happens naturally when the observable indicators of policy outcomes are not monotonic. Hence due to its commonness and harmfulness, it is important to monitor political polarization and its impact especially in public discussions about climate. [ 16] demonstrated that public opinion toward climate politics is closely consistent with people’s positions on parties and the US general public has become quite politically polarized in recent years. Further studies [ 6,19] showed similar alignment between polarized public opinions toward climate politics and partisan sorting. Considering the effect of events, [ 13] highlighted a large increase in polarization in 2021 during the 26th United Nations Conference of the Parties\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

This work aims to understand how real-world events influence opinions on climate change-related topics on social media.

We constructed a temporal graph from the user-user mentions network and applied the Louvain community detection algorithm to analyze changes in community structure around Conference of the Parties on Climate Change (COP) events.
