The climate change ML (CCML) community works on a diverse, challenging set of problems which often involve physics-constrained ML or heterogeneous spatiotemporal data. It would be desirable to use automated machine learning (AutoML) techniques to automatically find high-performing architectures and hyperparameters for a given dataset. In this work, we benchmark popular Au- toML libraries on three high-leverage CCML applications: climate modeling, wind power forecasting, and catalyst discovery. We find that out-of-the-box AutoML libraries currently fail to meaningfully surpass the performance of human-designed CCML models. However, we also identify a few key weaknesses, which stem from the fact that most AutoML techniques are tailored to computer vision and NLP applications. For example, while dozens of search spaces have been de- signed for image and language data, none have been designed for spatiotempo- ral data. Addressing these key weaknesses can lead to the discovery of novel architectures that yield substantial performance gains across numerous CCML applications. Therefore, we present a call to action to the AutoML community, since there are a number of concrete, promising directions for future work in the space of AutoML for CCML. We release our code and a list of resources at https: //github.com/climate-change-automl/climate-change-automl. 1 Introduction There is an increasing body of evidence which shows that climate change is one of the biggest threats facing humanity today [ 3,7,33,39]. Taking action towards climate change must come in many forms, such as reducing greenhouse gases and facilitating the adaption of renewable energy. A rapidly developing area of artificial intelligence research, climate change ML (CCML), is focused on applications to address climate change [11, 26, 38]. On the other hand, the automated machine learning (AutoML) community has been focused on designing efficient algorithms for problems such as hyperparameter optimization (HPO) and neural architecture search (NAS) [ 22]. In general, the goal of AutoML is to develop algorithms that automate the process of designing architectures and tuning hyperparameters for a given dataset. Although AutoML would seemingly be most useful on understudied datasets where there is less human intuition [ 36,47], most AutoML techniques, whether implicitly or explicitly, are tailored to CV and NLP tasks. Furthermore, a few recent works show that state-of-the-art AutoML techniques for common CV-based tasks do not transfer to other non-CV tasks [ 32,47]. A natural question is therefore, are AutoML techniques beneficial for high-impact CCML applications? âˆ—Work done while RT was part-time at Abacus.AI.
