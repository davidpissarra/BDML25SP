Effects of climate change on atmospheric circulations are complex and many open research questions remain in this context, e.g., on future trends of anticyclonic conditions. Based on the combination of a catalog of labeled circulation patterns and spatial atmospheric variables, we propose a smoothed convolutional neural network classiﬁer for six types of anticyclonic circulations that are associated with drought and heat. Our work can help to identify important drivers of hot and dry extremes in climate simulations, which allows to unveil the impact of climate change on these drivers. We address various challenges inherent to circulation pattern classiﬁcation that are also present in other climate patterns, e.g., subjective labels and unambiguous transition periods. 1 Introduction In recent summers such as those of 2003, 2010 and 2018, Europe has been subject to particularly outstanding summer drought and heat events, which caused large economic and societal damage including heat-related deaths [1, 2]. The frequency and intensity of hot and dry extremes has recently increased and is projected to further increase due to climate change and rising global mean temperatures [3, 4]. Drivers of hot and dry extremes There are two key processes leading to drought and heat events: thermodynamic and dynamic factors. Thermodynamic factors involve, e.g., evaporation and the feedback between soil moisture and air temperature. Dynamic factors on the other hand describe the atmospheric drivers of heat and drought, which are mainly anticyclonic conditions and blocking [3]. While anticyclonic conditions go along with various high-pressure systems, blocking describes a particular, persistent high-pressure situation that is associated with the displacement of westerly winds and their accompanying weather systems [3, 5]. These atmospheric drivers of hot and dry extremes are part of the large-scale atmospheric circulation in the mid-latitudes, which control the weather and climate over Europe [6, 7]. Changes in the atmospheric circulation are complex with opposing processes and thus many open research questions remain [5, 8]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Classiﬁcation of circulation patterns Objectively classifying the circulation patterns that are associated with hot and dry extremes is an important step towards a better understanding of how climate change affects the atmospheric drivers of potentially disastrous extreme events. Previous studies, e.g., [9, 10, 11] have shown that deep learning approaches are powerful tools for the detection of extreme weather in climate simulations. In this study, we use a subjective catalog of circulation type classiﬁcations over Europe by Hess & Brezowsky [12, 13]. Our goal is to learn the categorization of six circulation types with anticyclonic conditions over Europe, which are associated with dry and hot summer conditions in Central Europe [14]. The classiﬁcation of circulation types comes with various challenges that need to be addressed with appropriate modeling strategies. Challenges include noisy labels due to subjective expert choices in ambiguous climate situations [15], an imbalanced class distribution of labels, undeﬁned transition days between successive circulation patterns, and a ﬁxed dwell time of a circulation pattern of at least three consecutive days by its deﬁnition [13]. Our contribution In this work we propose a novel modeling procedure to address existing chal- lenges in classifying anticyclonic circulation patterns. Especially in times of large ensembles of climate simulations [16] that consist of dozens of model runs and thousands of model years, our study can help to efﬁciently analyse large climate simulations and be another piece of the puzzle to better understand changes in the atmospheric drivers of drought and heat. 2 Data The Hess & Brezowsky catalog contains a subjective categorization of circulation patterns created by experts manually labelling air pressure patterns over Europe into 29 classes. In this way, daily air pressure constellations are retrospectively assigned to one of these classes. A circulation pattern is, by deﬁnition, required to last at least three days. The six circulation patterns associated with heat and drought are (abbreviations originate from German): Zonal ridge across Central Europe (BM), Norwegian Sea-Iceland high, anticyclonic (HNA), North-easterly anticyclonic (NEA), Fennoscandian high, anticyclonic (HFA), Norwegian Sea-Fennoscandian high, anticyclonic (HNFA), and South- easterly anticyclonic (SEA) [17, 14]. The mean air pressure patterns for the six circulation patterns of interest are given in Figure 1 for the variables sea level pressure andgeopotential height at 500 hPa (average values at roughly 5500 meters height).
