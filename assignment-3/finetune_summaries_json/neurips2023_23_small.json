We develop an emulator of climate extremes that produce the temporal evolution of probability distributions of local variables on a spatially resolved grid. The representative modes of climate change are identified using principal component analysis (PCA), and the PCA time series are approximated using stochastic models. When applied to ERA5 data, the model accurately reproduces the quantiles of local daily maximum temperature and effectively captures the non-Gaussian statistics. We also discuss potential generalization of our emulator to different climate change scenarios. 1 Introduction Prediction of extreme events under climate change is challenging but essential for local communities, businesses, and governments to manage risks [ 1,2,3]. For example, an increasing number of heat wave events have been reported during the Northern Hemisphere summer, which has led to severe consequences for local economies [ 4]. Due to the chaotic property of the climate system and the unlikely nature of the extreme events, obtaining the statistics of extreme events from ensembles of Earth system models (ESM) is prohibitively expensive [ 5]. There is a growing need for emulators, or reduced-complexity models, that produce an accurate and efficient estimation of the statistics of extreme events in response to different policy scenarios. Existing emulators that assess climate change can be categorized by the type of their output. A majority of emulators focused on predicting the statistics of the global-mean or regional-mean quantities [ 6,7], including temperature or precipitation anomaly. The second category of emulators specialize in generating spatially-resolved local statistics, as well as the response to climate change. These emulators are generally based on pattern scaling, where the local responses are assumed as a linear function of global mean temperature [ 8]. The spatial correlation between grid points can be modelled using a Matern covariance function [ 9], and internal variability has been represented using autoregressive process or spectrum of principal components [ 10,11]. However, the focus of most spatially-resolved emulators remains on mean quantities. Only a few recent studies have explored emulating the evolution of climate extreme indices, such as annual maximum temperature [ 12] or the duration of hot waves within a year [ 13]. To the authors’ best knowledge, no prior work has reported Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: (i) Visualization of PCA modes extracted from 1979-1998 TMX data: ( a) The most energetic mode; ( b) The fastest growing mode.

We introduce a machine learning stochastic model to emulate the statistics of climate extremes, utilizing temperature-related extreme events as a prototypical application. We first perform a principal component analysis (PCA) of the global temperature fields to reduce the dimensionality of the system, while maintaining a high spatial resolution. The leading modes that represent climate change are identified. The temporal evolution of the PCA coefficients are modelled as stochastic processes, characterized by long-term trends, seasonal variations, and colored noise, thus making it possible to capture non-Gaussian statistics of local quantities. Our model can be further parameterized by the global mean temperature and generalized across diverse climate change scenarios. 2 Data and Methods In this study we consider near-surface daily maximum temperature (TMX) data on a spatially resolved grid ( 0.25◦×0.25◦), obtained from ERA5 reanalysis [ 14]. The 1979-1998 data will be used for training, and 1999-2018 data for testing. At location xand time t, the TMX is denoted as q(x, t). The climatological mean ¯q(x, t)is extracted by averaging TMX on the same day and location over a multi-year period. In other words, ¯q(x, t)has an annual periodicity ¯q(x, t+T) = ¯q(x, t), where T corresponds to one year. The fluctuating fields are then decomposed as superposition of PCA modes ϕj(x), q(x, t) = ¯q(x, t) +X jaj(t)ϕj(x). (1) Two representative PCA modes are visualized in figure 1. Panel ( a) shows the most energetic mode that is reminiscent of Arctic Oscillation/Northern Hemisphere Annular Mode [ 15]. The projection of instantaneous fields onto this particular mode (red dashed line in aii) is close to statistically stationary. Panel ( b) displays the mode that experiences the most rapid linear growth in response to climate change; notably, the shape of this mode suggests increased heating in the polar regions. Assuming the climatological mean and PCA modes in (1) are known, we model the time series of PCA coefficients as long term\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
