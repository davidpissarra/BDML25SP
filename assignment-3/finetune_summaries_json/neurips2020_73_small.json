They are responsible for the deaths of 60,000 people a year worldwide, on average [ 18]. The timely allocation of resources in the event of these tragedies is crucial to saving lives. Additionally, natural disasters cause varying levels of damage to buildings. The havoc wreaked by them causes widespread infrastructure damage, in some cases leading to a \"cascade effect\" [ 15]. The resulting economic impact is colossal. For example, since 1980, the United States has sustained 273 weather and climate disasters that have caused damages exceeding 1 billion US dollars (USD), totaling 1.79 trillion USD [ 6]. Unfortunately, the frequency and severity of these disasters will only continue to increase, exacerbated by climate change [ 22]. The catastrophic impact of natural disasters and their increasing prevalence motivates the problem addressed in this work. In order to prepare for and recover from these terrible but inevitable events, robust emergency response plans must be in place. This requires quickly and accurately analyzed data from the disaster site. Because it is almost always difﬁcult to obtain damage assessment and other details from on the ground in a timely manner, satellite imagery has gained popularity in being used to analyze these types of situations. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to locate and classify building damage within satellite imagery [ 12,11,25,9]. However, the current literature is limited in the interpretability of what exactly these neural networks are learning and what is most useful in assessing building damage. To better address this problem, we present a novel analysis of the most important information that a deep learning model needs to assess building damage. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture called a residual neural network (ResNet), pre-trained on Imagenet data [ 13]. In our approach, we train multiple CNNs on xBD satelite imagery data [ 10], with different modalities of input, as well as using different loss functions, and compare accuracy on the validation set. We aim to explicitly provide insight into the most effective ways to train models to classify levels of building Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.damage, maximizing the efﬁciency of the emergency response after a natural disaster, which has the potential to save lives and reduce economic strain. 2 Related Works Satellite imagery is useful in a plethora of areas, including for assessment of marine ecology [ 21], weather forecasting [ 4], and even in studying and predicting the spread of infectious disease [ 19]. Lately, there has been increased interest in using satellite imagery for humanitarian purposes such as responding to natural disasters [ 17]. Satellite imagery also provides insights for agriculture [ 26] and urban road damage [ 16]. More generally, change detection, which is the process of identifying differences in the state of an object by observing it at different times, can be used with satellite imagery in a variety of contexts. There are a few primary categories in which change detection approaches fall: algebra-based, transform-based, and classiﬁcation-based [ 1]. Change detection has been employed on satellite imagery to study deforestation [ 23], urban growth [ 14], and more. One speciﬁc area that has garnered signiﬁcant attention in computer vision and satellite imagery is building damage assessment. Recent works have studied semantic building segmentation [ 12,11] and cross-region transfer learning to avoid overﬁtting [ 25]. Furthermore, [ 9] presents a semi-supervised approach. xView2 recently introduces a dataset, xBD, discussed more in detail later in this work [ 10]. Many teams [ 24] competed in the xView2 data competition and improved upon the baseline model provided [ 10]. In our work, we focus on building damage assessment via image classiﬁcation and change detection. We speciﬁcally hone in on what information is most useful in accurate classiﬁcations of building damage and analyze which loss functions are most ﬁt for training our models and yield the most precise results. Our primary contribution is to improve upon the interpretability of machine learning models of prior works and existing literature in this area by explicitly examining per-building classiﬁcation prediction accuracy with different combinations of inputted information and loss functions. 3 Methods 3.1 Dataset Details For this work, we utilize the xBD dataset [ 10], which covers\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
