Dead trees are a key indicator of overall forest health, housing one-third of forest ecosystem biodiversity, and constitute 8%of the global carbon stocks. They are decomposed by several natural factors, e.g. climate, insects and fungi. Accurate detection and modeling of dead wood mass is paramount to understanding forest ecology, the carbon cycle and decomposers. We present a novel method to construct precise shape contours of dead trees from aerial photographs by combining established convolutional neural networks with a novel active contour model in an energy minimization framework. Our approach yields superior performance accuracy over state-of-the-art in terms of precision, recall, and intersection over union of detected dead trees. This improved performance is essential to meet emerging challenges caused by climate change (and other man- made perturbations to the systems), particularly to monitor and estimate carbon stock decay rates, monitor forest health and biodiversity, and the overall effects of dead wood on and from climate change. 1 Introduction With the increasing global interest in understanding and mitigating climate change, researchers ﬁnd themselves presented with new problems. One such problem is understanding the role and behavior of dead trees in these processes, as they are a key indicator of forest health. Forests are a core component in the global carbon cycle and are the most efﬁcient ecosystem on the planet for scrubbing CO2 and returning oxygen to the atmosphere, sequestering as much CO2 as all of the oceans. Carbon stocks and ﬂuxes in dead wood – fallen and standing dead trees, branches, and other woody tissues – are a critical component of forest carbon dynamics ( 1), constituting 8%of the global forest carbon stocks ( 2). Furthermore, dead wood houses one-third of all forest biodiversity, which is of crucial importance as an ecosystem’s bioversity is directly linked to its stability and the ability to withstand climate change. Dead trees are decomposed by several natural factors (including climate, fungi and insects), however, the inﬂuence of these decomposers as well as the impact of environmental change upon them remains poorly understood. While initial studies of both insects ( 3) and fungi ( 4;5) have been performed, further studies are still needed to gain a more holistic understanding. In particular, there is an increasing need for both larger scale and longitudinal studies of the impact of dead trees Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.on the ecology of forests, and their interaction with the carbon cycle and decomposers (see e.g. ( 1) and citations within). These efforts are hindered by a lack of data and tools for processing the data, particularly from aerial photography, which offers a good trade-off between high spatial resolution and cost efﬁciency, making it ideal for localized studies. In order to address this need we propose the use of Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to identify the location and shape of dead trees. Namely, using Computer Vision (CV) ML techniques applied to aerial photos of a forest at multiple time steps a temporal change in tree crowns can be made, providing estimates in decay rates. The motivation of this work is to develop a method to accurately model and estimate dead wood mass. There are however other applications ranging e.g. from tracking the health of a forest by identifying dead and dying trees from invasive insects and disease, to tracking desertiﬁcation and reforestation after harvesting or wildﬁres, to the development of algal blooms in the ocean. The precise fallen tree maps could be further used as a basis for plant and animal habitat modeling, studies on carbon sequestration as well as soil quality in forest ecosystems. The method we propose is a hybrid of two convolutional neural networks with a novel active contour model for precise object contour segmentation. We use infrared aerial imagery to identify dead vegetation, a widely used technique due to the difference in reﬂectance caused by differences in chlorophyll in the near-infrared spectral band. Due to recent improvements in this technology, in speciﬁc the increase in resolution, the current existent, non-Machine Learning, methods are unable to provide the highest satisfactory performance. These discrepancies are then only exaggerated when the amount of available data is drastically increased by the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UA Vs) to collect data more often for the same forest. The details of the method are as follows: We use leading convolutional network approaches U-Net for instance segmentation to compute class probability masks of the dead trees and a Mask R-CNN (Mask Regional-CNN) to segment the image into components, in particular separating trees from each other. The Mask R-CNN can successfully identify the number and precise position of the trees.
