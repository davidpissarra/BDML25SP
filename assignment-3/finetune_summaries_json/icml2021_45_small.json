Introduction The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a global framework for addressing the challenges of anthropogenic climate change (Leggett, 2020). Under the 2015 Paris Agreement each UNFCCC signatory agreed to submit a Nationally Determined Con- tribution (NDC) upon ratiﬁcation of the agreement by the country’s national government (UNFCCC, 2016).

The volume of information contained in climate policy doc- uments is growing rapidly. Every year large stakeholders such as governments and corporations produce text-based climate assessments and action plans to communicate and satisfy regulatory requirements. NLP and machine learn- ing can be used to provide data for climate policy analysis, improve tools for evaluating policy, and provide new tools for policy assessment (Rolnick et al., 2019). Supervised and unsupervised NLP content analysis methods have been used to analyze political texts (Grimmer & Stewart, 2013) including climate negotiation texts (Venturini et al., 2014; Ruiz et al., 2016; Baya-Lafﬁte & Cointet, 2016), climate adaptation analyses (Biesbroek et al., 2020), and corporate climate ﬁnancial disclosures (Luccioni & Palacios, 2019). BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is a bidirectional transformer model that has been pretrained on a large corpus of textual data using the masked language modeling objective.

Recently, the BERT model has been used to extract informa- tion from climate-related regulatory disclosures. Varini et al. (2021) use BERT to classify sentences from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ﬁlings as climate related or not climate related. K ¨olbel et al. (2020) apply BERT to SEC ﬁlings to distinguish between sentences that discuss physical climate risk (e.g., due to sea level rise or extreme weather events) and transition risk (due to expected changes in climate-related regulation). Using the classiﬁed text they develop metrics that they relate to credit default swap rates. Bingler et al.

Introduction\n\nThe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) is a global framework for addressing the challenges of anthropogenic climate change (Leggett, 2020). Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, each UNFCCC signatory agreed to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) upon ratification of the agreement by the country's national government (UNFCCC, 2016). These climate action plans set objectives and timelines for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions for each country. The documents, while often aspirational in nature, provide useful information about the challenges facing each country, their stance towards climate change, and their ambitions regarding mitigation efforts (Tribett et al., 2017).\n\nHere, a deep learning model is applied to 165 of these documents to build a sentence classifier that could be used to generate policy-relevant metrics over a wide range of documents. The volume of information contained in climate policy documents is growing rapidly. Every year, large stakeholders such as governments and corporations produce text-based climate assessments and action plans to communicate and satisfy regulatory requirements. NLP and machine learning can be used to provide data for climate policy analysis, improve tools for evaluating policy, and provide new tools for policy assessment (Rolnick et al., 2019).\n\nSupervised and unsupervised NLP content analysis methods have been used to analyze political texts, including climate negotiation texts (Venturini et al., 2014; Ruiz et al., 2016; Baya-Laffite & Cointet, 2016), climate adaptation analyses (Biesbroek et al., 2020), and corporate climate financial disclosures (Luccioni & Palacios, 2019). BERT (Devlin et al., 2019) is a bidirectional transformer model that has been pre-trained on a large corpus of textual data using the masked language modeling objective. BERT and other pre-trained transformer models, through fine-tuning, have achieved state-of-the-art results in a variety of NLP tasks, including sentence classification. This makes them good candidates for climate change text applications where large labeled datasets are currently unavailable.\n\nRecently, the BERT model has been used to extract information from climate-related regulatory disclosures. Varini et al. (2021) used BERT to classify sentences from U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings as climate-related or not climate-related. Kolbel et al.
