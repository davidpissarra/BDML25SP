In this work, we propose a late fusion model which integrates two different NWP sources alongside satellite images to make 0-8 hour lead time forecasts for grid regions across Great Britain. We limit the model inputs to be reflective of those available in a live production system. We show how the different input data sources contribute to average error at each time horizon and compare against a simple baseline. 1 I NTRODUCTION In order to limit global warming to well below 2◦C, rapid and deep reductions in energy system carbon intensity are required (Clarke et al., 2022). A decarbonised electricity grid must incorporate renewable but intermittent energy sources, of which photovoltaic (PV) solar power has the greatest potential globally (Dupont et al., 2020). This makes it very important to be able to forecast PV power input to national grids, as trusting inaccurate forecasts can lead to imbalance and power outages, or surges. A lack of accurate forecasts means that grid operators must keep significant control reserves (Jost et al., 2015) provided by spinning coal and gas reserve, and diesel generation (Huxley et al., 2022). This has a monetary and carbon cost (Gandhi et al., 2024), and is a promising area for machine learning (ML) based forecasts (Donti & Kolter, 2021). In this paper, we introduce a multi-modal late fusion network to forecast regional PV power outputs across Great Britain (GB) from 30 minutes to 8 hours ahead using satellite data, and multiple sources of numerical weather prediction (NWP) inputs. Other similar work has trained machine learning models to predict solar PV power. V oyant et al. (2017) and Sobri et al. (2018) offer reviews of ML and traditional statistical prediction methods in this area. However, these reviews only include ML systems that use point-like rather than spatially resolved inputs. More recent work, such as Mathe et al. (2019), explore the use of spatially resolved NWP inputs and use more modern network architectures. Other work such as Si et al. (2021) instead uses spatially resolved satellite imagery as inputs. Here we show the benefit of using both satellite and multiple NWP input sources within a single network. We show the influence of these data sources on the forecast accuracy at various time horizons and set a baseline for accuracy on this dataset predicting regional PV across Great Britain. 2 GB REGIONAL PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER The GB national electricity grid is subdivided into 317 Grid Service Points (GSPs) (National Grid ESO) (shown in appendix figure 2), which represent the approximate geographical areas served by discrete parts of the electricity distribution network. These GSPs vary substantially in both spatial 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 size, ranging from 1km2to 7000km2, and in total capacity of installed PV systems, ranging from <1MW to nearly 500MW. The spatial size and PV capacity of these GSPs are relatively uncorrelated. There are numerous solar farms and individual consumer PV systems within each GSP. Many of these systems do not report their outturn or only report outturn with a significant delay. They feed power into the grid blindly, and cannot be monitored by grid operators in real time. Since these systems lie on the distribution network they appear to National Grid ESO (GB’s grid operator) as a reduction in demand rather than as generation. Despite these difficulties, estimates of the regional PV power outturn can be made (Huxley et al., 2022). These estimates are made by upscaling from a representative sample of PV systems that do report outturns to the total PV outturn of all known systems within the region (e.g. Lorenz et al. (2011)). In GB such estimates are available from PVLive (Sheffield Solar PVLive) at 30-minute intervals. 3 I NPUT DATA SOURCES We use 11 spectral channels of satellite data from the EUMETSAT SEVIRI rapid scanning service (EUMETSAT; Google Datasets) which scans GB (amidst a much wider area) every 5 minutes. In GB the resolution of these images is approximately 4.6 ×7.1km per pixel. We also use NWP data from the Met Office UKV model and from the ECMWF IFS model. The UKV data was downloaded from the CEDA archive (Met Office, Centre for Environmental Data Analysis), is at resolution 2 ×2km, and consists on 8 forecast initialisation-times (init-times) per day. The IFS data was downloaded directly from the ECMWF data portal and comes from the HRES configuration (ECMWF). It is at a resolution of 0.05 ×0.05�\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
