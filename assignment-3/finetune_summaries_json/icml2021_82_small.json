Introduction Lowering human greenhouse gases emissions is one major goal of the efforts against climate change, and the focus and concern of international cooperation (Paris Agreement, 2015). Many indicators of human development - population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), environmental footprint - have been following exponential curves during the past decades (Steffen et al., 2015); hence, drastic measures are needed if we are to switch from increasing to quickly de- creasing emissions, as expressed in global organisations goals (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014)). Understanding and forecasting the evolution, on a country- scale, of various indicators related to carbon emissions, may help to give a clear idea of the progress we are making, or not, towards lower emissions. The main indicators that we chose to study are the variables appearing in Kaya identity (Kaya & Yokoburi, 1997), on a country level: population, national GDP, energy supply and CO2 emissions. Our main objective is to develop a model able to use this data to make accurate forecasts, on a medium/long-time horizon.

In particular, the recent development of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations offers a promising perspective in this case (Chen et al., 2019) - we explain the reasons for this choice in 3.2. We adapted Neural ODEs for this problem and compared the performance with a baseline statistical model. 2. Kaya identity & impact on climate change The Kaya identity expresses a very simple relation between carbon emissions F, energy supply E, Gross Domestic Prod- uct (GDP) Gand population P:F=P\u0002G P\u0002E G\u0002F E. G Pis the GDP per capita, representing our average life stan- dard, which we generally want to increase;E Gis the energy intensity of the GDP - the energy needed to create one unit of GDP -, it quantiﬁes the efﬁciency of energy usage in our activities;E Fis the carbon intensity of energy - the CO2 emission corresponding to the supply of one unit of primary energy - and indicates how reliant on carbon emissions our electricity production is. Forecasting human development and carbon emissions is possible both with the set of raw variables fP; G; E; Fg and with the set of indicators appearing in the Kaya identity fP;G P;E G;F Eg. However, the latter gives a clearer analy- sis, from a macroscopic point of view (Ritchie & Roser, b). While the raw variables are very strongly correlated altogether and vary greatly between countries, the variables from the Kaya equation look more like consistent indica- tors actionable under the right choice of policies (Hwang et al., 2020). Overall, using these four indicators seems to be a good choice in order to assess efforts made by a coun- try or region concerning carbon emissions ( ˇStreimikien ˙e & Balezentis, 2016). 3. Methodology 3.1. Datasets Four datasets were used for this study: datasets for popula- tion (World Bank, 2020b) and GDP (World Bank, 2020a) were collected from the World Bank Open Data platform; the total energy supply (IEA, 2020a) and the CO2 emis-Forecasting emissions through Kaya identity using Neural ODEs sions from fuel combustion (IEA, 2020b) were extracted from public datasets from the International Energy Agency. It should be noted that this is not the total emission for each country - however, greenhouse gases emitted by fuel combustion represent around 75% of all greenhouse gases emissions (Ritchie & Roser, a). Each variable is available yearly, from 1971 to 2019, for at least 54 countries. 3.2. Motivations for a machine-learning approach In the domain of energy and emissions, forecasts are often relying on expert knowledge and statistical models (York et al., 2003; Auffhammer & Steinhauser, 2008); an exten- sive set of Integrated Assessment Models are used to ex- plore how system Earth evolves during the next decades, following speciﬁc scenarios (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (2014)), (Lucas et al., 2015). In other ﬁelds, grey models (Deng, 1989) have been used successfully\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nLowering human greenhouse gas emissions is a major goal of efforts against climate change, as emphasized by the Paris Agreement (2015). Many indicators of human development, such as population, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), and environmental footprint, have followed exponential curves over the past decades (Steffen et al., 2015). To switch from increasing to decreasing emissions, drastic measures are needed, as stated in global organizations' goals (IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, 2014). Understanding and forecasting the evolution of various indicators related to carbon emissions on a country scale can help assess progress towards lower emissions.\n\nWe chose to study the variables appearing in the Kaya identity (Kaya & Yokoburi, 1997) on a country level: population, national GDP, energy supply, and CO2 emissions. Our main objective is to develop a model that uses this data to make accurate forecasts on a medium- to long-term horizon. Machine-learning models offer advantages over traditional methods, such as statistical models (Cerqueira et al., 2019). The recent development of Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Chen et al., 2019) offers a promising perspective in this case.\n\nWe adapted Neural ODEs for this problem and compared their performance with a baseline statistical model. \n\nThe Kaya identity expresses a simple relation between carbon emissions, energy supply, GDP, and population: F = P * G * P * E * G * F / E. The GDP per capita (G) represents our average life standard, which we generally want to increase. The energy intensity of the GDP (E) quantifies the efficiency of energy usage in our activities. The carbon intensity of energy (E) indicates how reliant on carbon emissions our electricity production is.\n\nForecasting human development and carbon emissions is possible with both the set of raw variables (P, G, E, F) and the set of indicators appearing in the Kaya identity (P, G, G, E, F). However, the latter gives a clearer analysis from a macroscopic point of view (Ritchie & Roser, b).
