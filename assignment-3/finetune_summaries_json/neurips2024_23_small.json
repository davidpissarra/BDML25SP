Covering 614k postcodes, ranging from 5-150 households, our dataset integrates domestic energy consumption data with variables spanning building characteristics, local environment, and socio-demographics. This dataset offers a new level of granularity in national energy analysis. It can provide insights for retrofit planning, material stock analysis and energy policy, transforming approaches to small-scale energy analysis and supporting the UK’s climate goals. 1 Introduction and Background Buildings significantly contribute to global GHG emissions, accounting for 33% of global CO 2 emissions related to energy and processes in 2021 [ 1]. Urban building energy modelling (UBEM) approaches particularly bottom-up methods, are important for understanding and reducing these emissions. Bottom-up UBEM can scale to national levels through archetype approaches or building- level predictions using machine learning [ 2]. These methods utilize existing building stock datasets [3], [4] or remote sensing data [ 5,6]. However, there’s a notable lack of open-access building-level energy datasets, with most available data concentrated in US cities [7, 8]. In Europe, the lack of building energy data is primarily due to privacy concerns. While most available datasets are from the US, the UK has two main open datasets: the National Energy Efficiency Data Framework (NEED) and the Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) database [ 9]. However, both UK datasets have significant limitations. NEED’s anonymized nature means insights cannot be geolocated beyond regional identification, while EPCs suffer from accuracy issues, including over-prediction of energy intensity and inconsistent ratings across assessments [10]. To address these challenges, we introduce the NEBULA ( Neighbourhood Energy, Buildings, and Urban Landscapes) dataset, an open-source dataset operating at the small neighbourhood level (5-150 households), using domestic energy data from 2022 containing records for 614k postcodes across England and Wales. Such data at the postcode level maintains privacy while providing detailed information about building stock, climate, urbanisation, and socio-demographic factors, making it Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.valuable for energy benchmarking and predictive modelling in UK cities. A subset of the data has already been used in prior works to provide energy benchmarks for cities in the UK [11]. 2 Methodology The NEBULA dataset includes seven themes of variables: building stock, building typology, building age, region, urbanisation, climate and socio-demographics. These variables are derived from six datasets, open-source or accessible under academic licenses. Table 1 lists the input data sources and their licences. In total, NEBULA contains 244 variables (89 relating to the building stock, 124 related to socio-demographics, 10 to energy and 21 to regional and environmental variables) and is in tabular format indexed by Postcode. A sample of the variables is given in Table 1 and the current list of variables and accompanying metadata is provided in the supplementary information. Figure 1: NEBULA Data Sources.

Annual domestic energy consumption data is available at the postcode level in the UK, [ 18], providing total, median, and mean consumption for gas and electricity in kWh/year. We derived a variety of variables relating to the building stock per postcode using data from Verisk UKBuildings [ 13] dataset1. An example of a postcode with the identified domestic buildings is given in Figure 2. We identify buildings through an ID match and a spatial join between footprints. Variables relating to building typologies and building age are calculated as percentages at the postcode level. The local climate variables are Heating and Cooling Degree days (HDD, CDD), calculated from monthly temperature data from HAD-UK ([ 19]), calculated for summer, winter and annually for 2022. Urbanisation variables including postcode area and density are calculated using postcode shapefiles and total building footprint areas and integrate a rural/urban flag from the 2011 census. Socio-demographics are included through the matching of census data from the 2021 UK census to postcodes. These attributes were calculated for postcodes that are (a) - fully domestic postcodes,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
