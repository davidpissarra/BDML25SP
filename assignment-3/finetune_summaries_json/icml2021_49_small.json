In this work, we use convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for their property of feature extraction and general- izability on large datasets. We also use wavelet transforms and embed them as a layer in the ar- chitecture to help in denoising the radar images and reﬁne ice layer detection. Our results show that incorporating wavelets in CNNs helps in de- tecting the position of deep subsurface ice layers, which can be used to analyse their change over time. 1. Introduction The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) has the potential to in- crease sea level rise by 7.4m (Shepherd et al., 2020). Model projections estimate that associated imbalances in the cli- mate, such as snow accumulation rates, excessive melt-water runoff will continue to increase with a warming climate for the rest of the century (Shepherd et al., 2020; Montgomery et al., 2020). In this regard, analyzing the change in the ice sheet is imperative to project its climatic impact. One of the ways to analyse this change is through airborne observa- tions, such as those during the NASA Operation Ice Bridge (OIB) mission. The OIB mission ﬂew a Snow Radar sensor, operated by the Center for Remote Sensing of Ice Sheets (CReSIS), which captured the horizontal proﬁle of internal ice layers in grayscale images. Each ice layer present in these images 1Computer Vision and Remote Sensing Laboratory, University of Maryland Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD, USA.

By capturing such images every year, one can calculate the change in thickness of each of these layers, which is required to calculate the overall mass loss from GrIS. Figure 1.

H1, V1, and D1 denote the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal detail coefﬁcients of a level-1 wavelet transform, respectively. Processing the Snow Radar images from every year can be complicated due to the data size, and also because the images can be noisy, with the ice layers being visually in- distinguishable from each other. In this regard, we need efﬁ-Reﬁning Ice Layer Tracking through Wavelet combined Neural Networks cient, automated algorithms which can denoise the dataset and extract complex features from the images. Recently, deep learning has been applied on Snow Radar images (Yari et al., 2019; 2020; Rahnemoonfar et al., 2021; Varshney et al., 2020), due to its success in building efﬁcient com- puter vision algorithms, and also for being robust across large datasets. These works note that the models can be improved further, if the inherent noise in the images could be learnt and reduced in an end-to-end architecture. Wavelet transforms (Mallat, 1989) are signal processing techniques which help in image denoising. They can rep- resent images in a multiresolution format and depict the contextual as well as textural information of an image at different scales (Huang et al., 2017). In this work, we show that by taking wavelet transforms at intermediate stages of a neural network architecture (Figure 1), the denoised output produced after every stage is more ‘learned’ and helps in detecting ice layers as sharp edges. 2. Related Works Recently, there has been a lot of work with detecting ice layers from radar images, as well as improving the compu- tational complexity and feature detection of deep learning by incorporating wavelet transforms. In this section, we highlight the related literature in both these domains. 2.1. Deep Learning for Ice Layer Detection Deep learning has been extensively applied on remotely sensed radar images (Yari et al., 2019; 2020; Rahnemoonfar et al., 2021; Varshney et al., 2020) for its ability in fea- ture extraction and utility in automatically processing large datasets. Yari et al. (2019) used a multi-scale deep CNN to track the internal ice layers in Snow Radar images. The authors of the work also experimented with pretraining on BSDS dataset (Arbel ´aez et al., 2011) and found that the network does not work well because of the inherent noise in the Snow Radar dataset.
