Neural network-based models have emerged as promising alternatives, leveraging data-driven approaches to forecast atmospheric variables. In this work, we focus on limited-area modeling and train our model specifically for localized region-level downstream tasks. As a case study, we consider the MENA region due to its unique climatic challenges, where accurate localized weather forecasting is crucial for managing water resources, agriculture and mitigating the impacts of extreme weather events. This targeted approach allows us to tailor the model’s capabilities to the unique conditions of the region of interest. Our study aims to validate the effectiveness of integrating parameter- efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methodologies, specifically Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, to enhance forecast accuracy, as well as training speed, computational resource utilization, and memory efficiency in weather and climate modeling for specific regions.

Primarily, weather and climate modeling can be categorized into two types: numerical (NWP) methods and neural network-based models. The former, usually related to General Circulation Models (GCMs) [1, 2], are designed to simulate the flow of energy and matter across the land, atmosphere, and ocean. However, the ability to perform detailed simulations to forecast weather and atmospheric variables in NWP models is restricted by computational resources and the time required for execution. As a consequence, there is a pressing need to address computational challenges and improve the precision of weather and climate modeling. Neural network-based models [3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13] are data-centric and can absorb large-scale data to enhance performance. These models undergo comprehensive training on globally accessible datasets, thereby providing a viable alternative for predicting weather and climate patterns. Despite the absence of explicit physics assumptions in these models, the datasets employed for predictive task training inherently incorporate implicit physics assumptions. Within data-driven approaches, transformer-based [3, 7] and graph-based [6] models have been explored. One notable example of a transformer-based model is ClimaX [7], which focuses on developing a foundational model for climate and weather applications. ClimaX introduces a pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm, where during pre-training, it trains on data curated from physics-based models, enhancing its predictive capabilities and capturing relationships among atmospheric variables. This is followed by finetuning for various climate and weather tasks on a comprehensive climate reanalysis dataset.

The architecture modifies the main ViT by dealing with each channel separately for tokenization. methods include Pangu [3] and GraphCast [6], with the latter being a graph neural network based approach for weather prediction. GraphCast operates on a high-resolution latitude-longitude grid, employing an architecture consisting of an encoder, a processor, and a decoder. However, these models focus on global forecasts and do not account for region-specific dynamics. Our study focuses on a transformer-based weather and climate forecasting model trained for localized regional forecasting. The model capitalizes on comprehensive fine-tuning of the pre-trained weights of the global foundational model. It is crucial to investigate how these models can adapt to a paradigm of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) [14, 15, 16, 17], providing efficient training and maintaining optimal performance. This paper implements various PEFT methods, primarily incorporating Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, over the ClimaX model. LoRA enhances model efficiency by introducing trainable components to each layer, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters in large-scale models (Fig. 1). This approach addresses challenges related to speed, computational resources, and memory efficiency during the training of large models. In the pursuit of adapting large-scale models with a parameter-efficient tuning methodology for downstream forecasting tasks, our proposal involves the exploration and investigation of LoRA and its variants across the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). The MENA region has experienced significant climate impacts, with summer temperatures projected to rise at more than twice the global average. This increase in heat, along with extended heat waves, could affect the region’s habitat and can affect human health [18]. We aim to corroborate the efficacy of the proposed strategies in enhancing performance metrics, speed, and memory efficiency. Additionally, we integrate the flash attention mechanism into our approach, desirably accelerating the attention calculation process, and thereby facilitating resource-efficient model training for localized regions. 2 Method 2.1 Preliminaries Notations: To\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
