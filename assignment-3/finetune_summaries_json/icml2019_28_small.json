Introduction There is an increased commitment worldwide to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and countries are taking actions to better integrate renewable clean energies into their grids. As an example, many scientiﬁc studies tackle the challenge of photovoltaic (PV) power forecast. They rely on statistical time-series methods, physical methods, or ensemble meth- ods which combine different models to enhance accuracy (Sobri et al., 2018). Widely used time-series models can be separated into two groups: linear and non-linear models, where the latter often shows better prediction accuracy when enough data are available. Among non-linear time-series models, Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANN) have become increasingly popular for PV forecast (Ding et al., 2011; 1Froglabs, San Francisco2Reuniwatt. Correspondence to: Johan Mathe <johan@froglabs.ai >, Nina Miolane <nina.miolane@polytechnnique.fr >.Kardakos et al., 2013; Dolara et al., 2015) and among them Recurrent Neural Networks (Malvoni et al., 2013) and Long- Short Term Memory Networks (Abdel-Nasser & Mahmoud, 2017; Gensler et al., 2017). Meanwhile, ﬂexible non-linear predictions models tak- ing into account the spatiotemporal structure of the data, like Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) (Donahue et al., 2015), 2D LSTM or Convolutional LSTM architectures (ConvLSTM) (Shi et al., 2015), have been suc- cessfully applied to a variety of problems. LRCN models have been used in activity recognition, image captioning and visual question answering (Donahue et al., 2015). A 2D LSTM model has been applied to trafﬁc forecasting (Zhao et al., 2017) while a ConvLSTM has shown promis- ing results on a precipitation forecast that predicts rainfall intensity in a local region on a short time horizon (Shi et al., 2015) (also known as nowcasting), a weather-related predic- tion problem that shares similarities with PV forecast. Contributions This paper presents PVNet, a PV forecast- ing model that introduces an LRCN architecture to integrate past PV power 1D time-series with dense spatiotemporal NWP and physical models’ inputs. Our model extends the state-of-the-art 1D time-series models by learning spatial features with CNN modules, whose channels encode the NWP and physical models variables. We focus our analysis on the day-ahead PV forecast, whose accuracy is known to be highly dependent on NWP integration, and which is particularly interesting as energy market bids are placed one day in advance. Our experimental results show that our architecture manages to leverage these additional spatial data for prediction accuracy.
