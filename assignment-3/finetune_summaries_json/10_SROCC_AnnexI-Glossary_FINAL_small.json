(ed.)]. In: IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing  Climate  [H.-O. Pörtner, D.C. Roberts, V. Masson-Delmotte, P. Zhai, M. Tignor, E. Poloczanska, K. Mintenbeck, A. Alegría, M.  Nicolai, A. Okem, J. Petzold, B. Rama, N.M. Weyer (eds.)]. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA, pp. 677–702. https://doi.org/10.1017/9781009157964.010.Annex I Glossary sAI Ablation (of glaciers, ice sheets, or snow cover)  All processes that reduce the mass of a  glacier, ice sheet  or snow  cover. The main processes are melting, and for glaciers also  calving  (or, when the glacier nourishes an  ice shelf, discharge of ice across  the grounding line ), but other processes such as sublimation and  loss of wind-blown snow can also contribute to ablation. Ablation also refers to the mass lost by any of these processes. See also  Mass   balance/budget (of glaciers or ice sheets). Abrupt climate change  Abrupt change refers to a change that is substantially faster than the rate of change in the recent history of the affected components  of a system. Abrupt climate change refers to a large-scale change  in the   climate system that takes place over a few decades or less,  persists (or is anticipated to persist) for at least a  few decades,  and causes substantial disruptions in human and natural systems.  See also  Climate change, Human system, Natural systems and   Tipping  point. Accumulation (of glaciers, ice sheets or snow cover)  All processes that add to the mass of a  glacier, an ice sheet or snow  cover. The main process of accumulation is snowfall. Accumulation also includes deposition of hoar, freezing rain, other types of solid precipi-tation, gain of wind-blown snow, avalanching and basal accumulation  (often beneath ﬂoating ice). See also  Avalanche and Mass balance/ budget (of glaciers or ice sheets). Active layer  Layer of ground above  permafrost  subject to annual thawing and  freezing. Adaptability  See Adaptive capacity.  Adaptation  In human systems, the process of adjustment to actual or expected   climate  and its effects, in order to moderate harm or exploit beneﬁcial  opportunities. In  natural systems, the process of adjustment to actual  climate and its effects; human intervention may facilitate adjustment to expected climate and its effects.  Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA)  The use of ecosystem manage- ment activities to increase the  resilience  and reduce the  vulnerability   of people and  ecosystems  to climate change  (Campbell et al., 2009).   Evolutionary adaptation  The process whereby a species or pop- ulation becomes better able to live in a changing environment,  through the selection of heritable traits. Biologists usually dis- tinguish evolutionary adaptation from acclimatisation, with the latter occurring within an organism’s lifetime. Incremental adaptation  Adaptation that maintains the essence  and integrity of a system or process at a given scale (Park et al., 2012). In some cases, incremental adaptation can accrue to result in  transformational adaptation  (Tàbara et al., 2018; Termeer et al.,  2017). Incremental adaptations to change in climate are under-stood as extensions of actions and behaviours that already reduce the losses or enhance the beneﬁts of natural variations in  extreme  weather/climate events.  Transformational adaptation  Adaptation that changes the  fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system  in anticipa- tion of climate change  and its  impacts ; and adaptation responses  that will be required in the face of a global failure to mitigate the causes of  anthropogenic  climate change and are characterised by  system-wide change or changes across more than one system, by a focus on the future and long-term change, or by a direct question-ing of the effectiveness of existing systems, social injustices and power imbalances.  Adaptation limits  The point at which an actor’s objectives  (or  system needs) cannot be secured from intolerable risks  through adaptive actions.  Hard adaptation limit  – No adaptive actions are possible to  avoid\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
