Wilson ISAE-Supaero, University of Toulouse dennis.wilson@isae.fr Abstract Melt ponds are pools of water on Arctic summer sea ice that play an impor- tant role in the Arctic climate system. Retrieving their coverage is essential to better understand and predict the rapidly changing Arctic, but current data are limited. The goal of this study is to enhance melt pond data by developing a method that segments thermal infrared (TIR) airborne im- agery into melt pond, sea ice, and ocean classes. Due to temporally and spatially varying surface temperatures, we use a data-driven deep learning approach to solve this task. We adapt and fine-tune AutoSAM, a Segment Anything-based segmentation model. We make the code, data, and models available online1. 1 Introduction The Arctic region is undergoing rapid transformation due to anthropogenic climate change. Temperatures in the Arctic are rising three to four times faster than the global average, a process known as Arctic amplification [2, 38]. Since the beginning of satellite retrievals, scientists have observed a continuing loss of sea ice, with the current rate estimated at 12.7% per decade during summer months [26]. Future projections indicate a summer ice- free Arctic by the middle of this century [31]. These changes have significant implications for local communities and ecosystems [12, 42]. In addition, observations of Arctic warming coinciding with extreme weather events in the mid-latitudes are leading to discussions about linkages of the Arctic to the global climate system [3, 9]. Melt ponds are pools of water that form on Arctic sea ice as a result of summer ice and snow melt when temperatures rise above freezing. They can cover up to 60% and 80% of the ice area on flat sea ice at the peak of melt [6], and range in size from square centimeters to square kilometers [34]. Because of their darker color, melt ponds absorb significantly more sunlight than the white sea ice and snow [7, 11, 29, 35]. This causes surrounding areas to warm up, leading to accelerated ice melt — a positive feedback mechanism that is only stopped when the melt ponds start freezing again in fall. Melt ponds also increase the light transmittance of the surface with implications for the under-ice ecosystem [24, 28, 18]. Accurate measurement of melt pond coverage is fundamental for a variety of climate-relevant tasks, ranging from observing the energy balance at the ice surface [7], to improving coupled local and global climate model predictions [8, 36, 44], and sea ice concentration retrievals 1https://github.com/marlens123/autoSAM_pond_segmentation 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 [19]. However, observational data to date are limited. In Appendix A.1, we provide an overview of existing melt pond measurement methods. Here, we consider a newly collected dataset of helicopter-borne thermal infrared (TIR) im- agery to expand data available for melt pond analysis. TIR measures thermal radiation emitted from the surface [49]. An advantage of TIR over optical sensor data is its indepen- dence from lighting conditions. This allows retrieval when the sun is low above the horizon. TIR can also detect melt ponds in winter when they are overfrozen and snow covered [48]. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, the data used for this study are the first summer melt pond data using thermal infrared. For further analysis, we segmented the images into different surface classes. Prior work in this application domain has mainly used pixel-based and object-based approaches such as thresholding, pixel-based neural networks, edge detection, or combinations thereof (e. g., [25, 34, 50, 22, 15, 14, 10, 27, 52]). However, temporally and spatially varying surface temperatures2hamper the establishment of a fixed set of classification features for TIR images, and we consider a data-driven approach instead. The goal of this work is to effectively segment TIR images into melt pond, sea ice, and ocean classes. We rely on deep neural networks as the segmentation tool, as they have been shown to perform very well in segmentation tasks [21]. Specifically, we use an automatic and pre-trained version of the Segment Anything (AutoSAM) model as our model base [13]. We then fine-tune this model with the labeled TIR image data for melt pond segmentation. We fully describe the AutoSAM model in Appendix A.2. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data Our dataset comprises helicopter-borne TIR imagery acquired with an Infratec Vario-CAM HD head 680 camera during the PS131 ATWAICE campaign [17]3.
