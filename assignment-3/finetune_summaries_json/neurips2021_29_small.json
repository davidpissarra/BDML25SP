They also view each location as an i.i.d sample, ignoring spatial correlations in the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent neural network for crop yield prediction, which incorporates both geographical and temporal structure. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000 counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019. As far as we know, this is the ﬁrst machine learning method that embeds geographical knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level nationwide. Experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms a wide variety of existing state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness of geospatial and temporal information. 1 Introduction Climate change [ 1] has become a real and pressing challenge that poses many threats to our everyday life. Besides the evident extreme events [ 2], climatic variations also impact the yields of major crops [3]. Crop production is extremely vulnerable and sensitive to ﬂuctuations in climatic factors such as temperature, precipitation, soil, moisture, and many other factors [ 4]. Many recent works emphasize the need to adapt agricultural practices in light of climate change [5, 6]; to do this, it is necessary to predict how changes in climate will affect crop yield [ 7]. Crop yield prediction can help with food security [8], supply stability [9], seed breeding [10], and economic planning [11]. However, crop yield depends on numerous complex factors, including temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, soil type, etc. To model these complex relationships, machine learning methods have been widely adopted in crop yield prediction [ 12,13,14,15]. However, despite the enormous number of papers in this area, many of them share similar methods. Among around 70 papers we surveyed, 48 used neural networks, 10 used tree-based methods, and 10 used linear regressions (e.g. lasso). These methods often only differ in location (US, Brazil, India), study granularity (province, county, site/farm), crop types (soybean, corn), and time range (weeks to years). Similar ﬁndings are also reported in [ 7]. For many relatively small self-collected datasets, simpler models are preferred. But these models may not perform well on a large and diverse region like the entire US. \u0003Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.In addition, most machine learning methods used in prior work treat each county as an i.i.d. sample, which does not fully utilize the spatial structure of a larger region. For instance, if one county has a splendid harvest, the neighboring counties are likely to have high yields as well, which violates the independence assumption. We hence introduce graph neural networks (GNN) [ 16] to take into account the geographical relationships among counties. When the model makes a prediction for a county, it can combine the features from neighboring counties with its own features to boost the predictive power. GNN models have been successful in many tasks such as election prediction [ 17] and COVID forecasting [ 18]. In this paper, we propose a novel graph-based framework, GNN-RNN, which integrates both geospatial and temporal knowledge into crop yield prediction by using GNNs synergistically with RNNs. We compare our GNN-RNN method with a wide array of machine learning methods on a nationwide scale (over 2000 counties from 41 US states). We show that our novel GNN-RNN model can achieve superior performance on multiple nationwide benchmarks, consistently outperforming existing methods. On both RMSE and R2, our GNN-RNN outperforms the state-of-the-art CNN-RNN model by 10%. As far as we know, our work is the ﬁrst to incorporate geographical knowledge into crop yield prediction, and we show that doing so signiﬁcantly improves prediction accuracy. 2 Methods 2.1 Problem Formulation In crop yield prediction, we denote each county’s climatic features by xc;tand ground-truth crop yield byyc;t2R, wherec,trepresent county and year respectively.
