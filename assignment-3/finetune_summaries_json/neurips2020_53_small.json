Using these models, however, requires careful consideration both of data constraints and of model complexity for a given problem. Here, we use machine learning (ML) models to predict monthly stream water temperature records at three monitoring locations in the Northwestern United States with long-term datasets, using meteorological data as predictors. We ﬁt three ML models: a Multiple Linear Regression, a Random Forest Regression, and a Support Vector Regression, and compare them against two baseline models: a persistence model and historical model. We show that all three ML models are reasonably able to predict mean monthly stream temperatures with root mean-squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.63-0.91\u000eC. Of the three ML models, Support Vector Regression performs the best with an error of 0.63-0.75\u000eC. However, all models perform poorly on extreme values of water temperature. We identify the need for machine learning approaches for predicting extreme values for variables such as water temperature, since it has signiﬁcant implications for stream ecosystems and biota. 1 Introduction The Earth’s water resources are increasingly under stress due to changes in climate and land use. Current projections estimate decreases in water availability and worsening of water quality over the coming decades. There is an urgent need for accurate predictions of water quantity and quality at seasonal to decadal time-scales, and at local to regional spatial scales, to enable water managers to make better decisions with an uncertain future. A particular variable of importance is stream water temperature (WT), which affects many stream processes and also impacts ﬁsh and other aquatic biota [Heck et al., 2018]. Data-driven modeling of watershed variables such as discharge and groundwater levels that make use of large-scale meteorological and watershed data has become increasingly possible with growing amounts of publicly available water datasets [Kratzert et al., 2019, Müller et al., 2019]. Machine learning (ML) and deep learning models are also being increasingly considered for predictions of water quality, and speciﬁcally water temperatures due to the limitations of physics-based models to conduct these predictions and the ability of ML to reduce complexity of models particularly at large spatial scales [Carlisle et al., 2010, Zhu and Piotrowski, 2020, Jia et al., 2020]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Making accurate water quality and other hydrological predictions presents several challenges since watersheds are complex systems. In particular, several factors can inﬂuence stream temperature including meteorological conditions, river discharge, snow melt, groundwater temperature, reservoir and thermal power plant operations. It is typically difﬁcult to ﬁnd co-located datasets for potential predictor variables. The choice of spatial and temporal scales for prediction is also dependent on constraints of data availability and stakeholder needs. These decisions are problem dependent, changing with both spatial and temporal scales. Our goal is to determine if machine learning models can accurately predict water quality at the multiple spatial (point to basin-scale) and temporal (sub-daily to decadal-scale) scales that are relevant for disturbance events such as ﬂoods and droughts. Here, we start by using baseline ML models for predicting monthly water temperature at individual station locations using publicly available data. Understanding data dependencies with low-order models will help to better constrain the problem and give a low-complexity baseline comparison for predicting water quality at larger spatial scales and higher temporal resolutions. We pay special attention to how our models perform at predicting extreme values of water temperature. These extreme temperatures typically determine the suitability of the streams for ﬁsh habitat, and will be increasingly important since disturbances that adversely impact stream temperature in the short-term are projected to be more frequent with climate change. 2 Methods We develop models that predict water temperature using data from the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large Sample studies) dataset [Addor et al., 2017] for three stations in the Sandy River Basin. Stream temperature data for each station were retrieved from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) National Water Information System (NWIS). We select model input features (minimum and maximum air temperature, solar radiation, and month of year) through exploratory data analysis. Following data preprocessing, we ﬁt ﬁve models: a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR), a Random Forest Regression (RF), a Support Vector Regression (SVR), a historical model, and a persistence model. The historical, persistence, and MLR models do not have any hyperparameters, however RF and SVR models both have several (such as the number of trees and the regularization parameter.)
