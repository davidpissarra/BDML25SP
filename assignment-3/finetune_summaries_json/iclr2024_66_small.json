However, ob- servational data on most species remains very limited, and the amount of data available varies greatly between taxonomic groups. We introduce the problem of predicting species occurrence patterns given (a) satellite imagery, and (b) known information on the occurrence of other species. To evaluate algorithms on this task, we introduce SatButterfly, a dataset of satellite images, environmental data and observational data for butterflies, which is designed to pair with the existing SatBird dataset of bird observational data. To address this task, we propose a gen- eral model, R-Tran, for predicting species occurrence patterns that enables the use of partial observational data wherever found. We find that R-Tran outperforms other methods in predicting species encounter rates with partial information both within a taxon (birds) and across taxa (birds and butterflies). Our approach opens new perspectives to leveraging insights from species with abundant data to other species with scarce data, by modelling the ecosystems in which they co-occur. 1 I NTRODUCTION The interconnectedness of the climate and biodiversity crises has been widely acknowl- edged (P ¨ortner et al., 2021). Biodiversity and associated ecosystem services play a crucial role in both mitigating and adapting to climate change, as well as being severely threatened by it. It is essential to understand species distributions to inform land use decisions and adaptation measures. Using machine learning and remote sensing data has proved promising for a variety of tasks in biodiversity monitoring (Wang et al., 2010; Reddy, 2021) including species distribution modelling (Beery et al., 2021; Estopinan et al., 2022; Joly et al., 2022), improving on traditional methods us- ing only environmental data. Moreover, the integration of machine learning and citizen science has proved helpful to monitor biodiversity at scale, automating labelling and decreasing the need for costly field surveys (Lotfian et al., 2021; Antonelli et al., 2023). Recently, the SatBird Teng et al. (2023) dataset was proposed for the task of predicting bird species encounter rates from remote sensing imagery, leveraging observational data from the citizen science database eBird (Kelling et al., 2013). While this framework is useful to model species’ distributions in places where no data has been recorded before, birds represent an atypical case since relatively large amounts of data are available. For most taxonomic groups, records are present in significantly fewer locations. For example, the eButterfly database (Prudic et al., 2017) modelled after eBird pro- vides high quality presence-absence data for butterfly species but has smaller geographical coverage and less observation reports than eBird. Given this challenge, a potentially promising approach is to leverage the relationships between the occurrence patterns of different species, which are used extensively by ecologists e.g. in joint species distribution models. We design a task to explore this direction, using extensive bird occurrence data to help learn from sparser butterfly occurrence data, given the correlation in abundances between these two taxonomic groups (Gilbert & Singer, 1975; 1Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024 Debinski et al., 2006; Eglington et al., 2015). Butterflies are particularly affected by climate change, with many species being adapted to specific environmental conditions (Hill et al., 2002; R ¨odder et al., 2021; ´Alvarez et al., 2024). We hope furthermore that such techniques will be useful in gener- alizing ML predictions to other under-observed but hyper-diverse taxa threatened by climate change, such as amphibians, freshwater fish, and plants. In this paper, we consider the practical setting in which we want to do checklist completion for species encounter rates. Our main contributions are as follows: • We introduce SatButterfly, a dataset for predicting butterfly species encounter rates from remote sensing and environmental data. Importantly, a subset of the data are colocated with existing data from SatBird, making it possible for the first time to leverage cross-taxon relationships in predicting species occurrence patterns from satellite images. • We propose R-Tran, a model to train and predict species encounter rates from partial infor- mation about other species. R-Tran uses a novel transformer encoder architecture to model interactions between features of satellite imagery and labels. • We evaluate R-Tran and other methods in predicting species encounter rates from satellite images and partial information on the encounter rates of other species. We find that R-Tran surpasses the baselines while providing flexibility to use with a variable set of information. Problem definition We consider the regression task of predicting species encounter rates from satellite imagery given partial information.
