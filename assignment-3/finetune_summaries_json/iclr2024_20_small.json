However, cur- rent General Circulation Model (GCM) forecasts of AOD suffer from limited spa- tial resolution, making it difficult to accurately represent the substantial variability exhibited by AOD at the local scale. To address this, a deep residual convolutional neural network (ResNet) is evaluated for the GCM to local scale downscaling of low-resolution global AOD retrievals, outperforming a non-trainable interpola- tion baseline. We explore the bias correction potential of our ResNet using global reanalysis data, evaluating it against in-situ AOD observations. The improved resolution from our ResNet can assist in the study of local AOD variations. 1 I NTRODUCTION Aerosols, small atmospheric particles, can influence the global radiation balance as strongly as greenhouse gases and therefore play an important role in both local and global climate. PM 2.5 aerosol particles (i.e., those with diameter less than 2.5µm) are also the primary source of air pollu- tant responsible for causing significant health conditions, including respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses as well as lung cancer Beelen et al. (2013); Khomenko et al. (2021). Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is the column-integrated light extinction over an atmospheric column i.e., a measure of the degree to which transmission of light through an atmospheric column is reduced due to its scattering or absorption by aerosols. This can be expressed as: AOD λ=Zz2 z1eλ(x, y, z, t )dz where λis a particular wavelength. Surface PM 2.5mass concentrations have been found to be well- correlated with AOD Wang & Christopher (2003); Yang et al. (2019), leading to significant research directed towards estimating PM 2.5mass concentrations from AOD retrievals. High-resolution (HR) GCM forecasts of AOD are therefore essential for understanding the effects of local-scale air pol- lution on the climate, as well as for other downstream health-related applications. However, GCM forecasts are limited in their spatial resolution by computational costs. Typically, these forecasts operate at a global spatial resolution of 80-250km Iles et al. (2020), which is much higher than the spatial scales over which AOD can vary, particularly in urban areas. Image super-resolution (SR) is the problem of estimating a HR image from a lower-resolution coun- terpart image and has a wide range of applications from video surveillance Aakerberg et al. (2021) to medical diagnosis Chen et al. (2021). The problem is inherently ill-posed, and therefore challeng- ing, since an infinite number of high-resolution images can be obtained from a single coarse-grained image. SR is a highly researched field, with diverse approaches ranging from early interpolation Zhang & Wu (2006); Keys (1981); Duchon (1979) and reconstruction Zhang et al. (2012); Dai et al. (2009); Liu et al. (2016) approaches to ML-based approaches. The SR of climate variables is referred to as downscaling. Vandal et al. (2017) pioneered the ap- plication of ML for the task, utilizing a CNN to downscale satellite-observed precipitation data, 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 outperforming existing statistical methods. Consequently, ML has been established as the standard approach for the task. The SR-ResNet Ledig et al. (2017); Lim et al. (2017), built on residual blocks, has achieved state-of-the-art performance, in terms of restoration quality, for CNN approaches. A limited number of studies have explored downscaling AOD. Wang et al. (2022) explored the downscaling of monthly-averaged 50km-resolution AOD, coupled with elevation, to finer 10km- resolution over a relatively large study area encompassing Southwest Asia. They utilise fully- connected neural networks and ensure the preservation of inherent within-scale temporal correla- tions. Li et al. (2020) utilise an SR-ResNet autoencoder to perform both gap-filling and 10x down- scaling of weekly-averaged AOD in California, achieving impressive results. A recent study by Zhang et al. (2022a) utilizes a Generative Adversarial Network to gap-fill coverage over China.

Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) is a measure of the degree to which transmission of light through an atmospheric column is reduced due to scattering or absorption by aerosols. It can be expressed as:\n\nAOD(λ) = ∫z2z1e^(-λ(x, y, z, t))dz\n\nwhere λ is a particular wavelength.
