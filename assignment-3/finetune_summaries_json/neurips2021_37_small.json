Traditionally, damage inspection has been a completely manual process thus making it subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. Hence in this work, we bring more objectivity, scalability, and repeatability in our damage inspection process, using deep learning, to miss fewer cracks. We build a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of blade damages, collected by our drone-based inspection, to correctly detect cracks. Our model is already in production and has processed more than a million damages with a recall of 0.96. We also focus on model interpretability using class activation maps to get a peek into the model workings. The model not only performs as good as human experts but also better in certain tricky cases. Thus, in this work, we aim to increase wind energy adoption by decreasing one of its major hurdles - the O&M costs resulting from missing blade failures like cracks. 1 Introduction While the year 2020 saw one of the most stunning declines in global CO 2emissions due to the pandemic [ 11], the economic recovery post-pandemic is set to reverse 80% of that drop and global energy demand is set to increase by 4.6% in 2021 [ 12]. However, renewables remain the hope with projections of 30% contributions to electricity generation - the highest ever since the industrial revolution [ 12]. Wind alone is expected to be the prominent energy source by 2050 but for that to happen requires signiﬁcant technological advancements to reduce the costs of wind power [ 13]. O&M costs account for 20-24% of the total Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of current wind systems [8,25] with blade failures being the major contributor to the costs as the turbines operate in harsh environmental conditions and are made up of complex, expensive materials [ 7,16]. Damages on wind turbine blades, especially cracks on the surface, could indicate severe internal structural damages [ 6] and if left to grow can cause serious damages [ 2] to the blades. Additionally, missing cracks result in repair expenses ranging in multiple hundreds of thousands of dollars, making it highly important to catch these damages at the earliest to better operate the turbines and avoid heavy losses. [15, 1] There are a variety of sub-types in cracks like longitudinal, transverse, diagonal, buckling, etc., and can have very different visual appearances. At the same time, there are damage types other than cracks like chips, ﬂaking, scratches, etc. which can at times look very similar to cracks but are not as severe as cracks. Thus, the problem becomes not only to correctly identify all the different sub-types of cracks but also to not confuse the other similar-looking damages to be cracks. Figure 1 shows how some other types of damages can look very similar to cracks and thus requires one to carefully discern the differences. Typically, this process is carried out manually making it very labor-heavy, subjective, 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021), Sydney, Australia.and error-prone. This is where deep learning can improve upon human analysts and classical image processing methods. Since, with large enough data, deep learning models can identify discriminative, visual/non-visual features to distinguish cracks from the other very similar-looking damages and iteratively optimize that. In this work, we focus on creating an accurate, fast, and reliable deep learning-based method to identify cracks on wind turbine blades. Our goal is to include deep learning as a part of our Quality Check (QC) process to miss fewer cracks. In recent times, drone-based inspections of turbines have shown great promise as they avoid signiﬁcant turbine downtimes and reduce the human risk in inspection[ 9,22]. We perform drone-based inspections for wind farms capturing images in a variety of orientations, lighting, and weather conditions. From this, we carefully curate a dataset of 71k images and train a ResNet-50 on it, with speciﬁc training strategies. We then test the model on real-world data and take it to production. Our model is added as a layer in our QC process and the disagreements between the model and the human analyst are reviewed as a ﬁnal step. Related Work : There are some experimental works done in this domain like [ 2,26,27] use classical methods to detect certain cracks but can’t distinguish them from similar-looking damages and are sensitive to noise and uneven illumination. Deep learning has garnered a lot of attention recently for tasks related to surface damages like on concrete [ 4], steel [ 17], wood [ 14], etc. But very limited work is done when it comes to this particular problem. Works like [ 20,21] use a CNN to classify if a blade image contains any kind of damage. However, they suffer from having just a few hundred images and resulting in false-positive-rates as\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy and dirty parts removed:\n\nAccurate detection of blade damages, particularly cracks, is crucial for sustained operations and cost savings. Traditionally, damage inspection has been a manual process, making it subjective, error-prone, and time-consuming. To address this, we introduce a deep learning-based approach to bring objectivity, scalability, and repeatability to our damage inspection process, reducing the likelihood of missing cracks. We train a deep learning model on a large dataset of blade damages collected through drone-based inspections to accurately detect cracks. Our model, already in production, has processed over a million damages with a recall of 0.96. We also focus on model interpretability using class activation maps to gain insights into the model's workings. The model performs as well as human experts and even outperforms them in certain challenging cases.\n\nThe increasing global energy demand, projected to rise by 4.6% in 2021, highlights the need for renewable energy sources. Wind energy is expected to be a prominent source by 2050, but its adoption is hindered by high operational and maintenance (O&M) costs, which account for 20-24% of the total Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) of current wind systems. Blade failures are a significant contributor to these costs, as turbines operate in harsh conditions and are made of complex, expensive materials. Damages on wind turbine blades, especially cracks, can indicate severe internal structural damage and lead to costly repairs if left unchecked.\n\nThere are various types of cracks, including longitudinal, transverse, diagonal, and buckling, each with distinct visual appearances. Additionally, other damage types, such as chips, flaking, and scratches, can resemble cracks but are less severe. The challenge lies in correctly identifying all crack sub-types and distinguishing them from similar-looking damages. This process is typically manual, labor-intensive, and prone to errors.\n\nDeep learning can improve upon human analysts and classical image processing methods by identifying discriminative features to distinguish cracks from similar-looking damages. We focus on developing an accurate, fast, and reliable deep learning-based method to identify cracks on wind turbine blades. Our goal is to integrate deep learning into our Quality Check (QC) process to reduce the likelihood of missing cracks.\n\nDrone-based inspections have shown promise in reducing turbine downtimes and human risk.

We test the model on real-world data and deploy it in production, with human analysts reviewing any disagreements between the model and their assessments.\n\nRelated work in this domain has used classical methods to detect cracks but struggled to distinguish them from similar-looking damages. Deep learning has been applied to surface damage detection in various materials, but limited work has been done on this specific problem. Existing works have used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to classify blade images as damaged or not, but suffered from limited image datasets and high false-positive rates."
