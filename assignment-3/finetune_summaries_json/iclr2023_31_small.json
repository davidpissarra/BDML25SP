Species observations stemming from citizen science platforms are increasingly leveraged to gather information about the geographic distributions of many species. However, their usability is limited by the strong biases inherent to these community-driven efforts. These biases in the sampling effort are often treated as noise that has to be compensated for. In this project, we posit that better modelling the sampling effort (including the usage of the differ- ent platforms across countries, local accessibility, attractiveness of the location for platform users, affinity of different user groups for different species, etc.) is the key towards improving Species Distribution Models (SDM) using observations from citizen science platforms, thus opening up the possibility of leveraging them to monitor changes in species distributions and population densities. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate change is set to have dramatic impacts on biodiversity worldwide (Arneth et al., 2020), already driving shifts in species distributions with serious consequences for peoples’ quality of life (Shin et al., 2019). Predicting the effect of climate change on biodiversity is therefore an im- portant and highly-active field of research. Predictions can alert stakeholders and decision makers to potential future risks, motivate actions to sustain biodiversity and support the development of proactive Climate Change Adaption policies to reduce climate change impacts (Bellard et al., 2012). Predicting the impacts of climate change on biodiversity requires accurate Species Distribution Mod- els (SDMs). These models often rely on observations of presence and absence of a species obtained via systematic field surveys as labels and geo-located variables, such as climate data, soil maps or satellite imagery as inputs. However, survey data are very labor intensive, severely limiting their spatial scope and temporal frequency, which prevents to keep pace with the rapid effects of climate change (Jetz et al., 2019) and of other anthropogenic environmental disturbances. For this reason, big citizen science data has become especially relevant in generating predictions using SDMs due the large spatial scope and frequency at which this data are made available when compared to more systematic surveys (Geldmann et al., 2016). 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 Nevertheless, citizen science data contain very significant biases due to the manner in which the data are generated. These biases are related to the distribution of human population, the accessibility of species’ habitats, their seasonality, visibility and charisma (Chandler et al., 2017), and the usage of the citizen science platforms themselves. This has resulted in significant information gaps in biodiversity-rich but data-poor regions and a lack of species-level information for some of the most threatened species and biomes. These biases therefore present a fundamental challenge to the use of citizen science data in SDMs (Amano et al., 2016). Previous research has shown that explicitly accounting for the sampling effort can result in better SDMs (Botella et al., 2021), and our main hypothesis is that building a rich model of the sampling effort is the most promising direction to im- prove the state-of-the-art in SDMs. Although some previous work exists in modeling user behavior with respect to the time of the year and taxonomic groups (Di Cecco et al., 2021), this project would be the first, to the best of our knowledge, that aims at jointly learning the user behavior and species distributions in an end-to-end manner, thus leveraging the synergies between both tasks. We aim to develop a relevant new methodology in this under-explored area of research through the use of a hybrid approach that makes use of both 1) the large amounts of available, although biased, observation data and 2) priors about the behavior of citizen scientists and wildlife. The exponential growth in user base that these platforms have experienced in the last few years means that there is currently a unique opportunity to improve SDMs in low data areas by modeling the interactions between human observers and species in addition to their distributions. We will disentangle these important additional drivers of human observation bias to support the next generation of SDMs. Specifically, we will design Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) that simultaneously model observer and species densities, along with observer-species affinity estimates, to obtain an informed approxi- mation of the sampling effort (Figure 1). To do this, we will utilize big open access data on species presence available from citizen science platforms iNaturalist and Pl@ntNet, as well as other large photographic repositories such as Flickr, from which species observations can be inferred by ap- plying existing deep learning models for species identification. The use of BBNs will allow us to harness the ever-growing amount of observation data while leveraging prior knowledge about the behavior of both natural species and human observers (Moreira et al., 2021).
