In this paper, we present an approach to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their location and architectural characteristics, as well as the amount of solar radiation they receive annually. Our technique uses computer vision to achieve semantic segmentation of roof sections and roof objects on the one hand, and a machine learning model based on structured building features to predict roof pitch on the other hand. We then compute the azimuth and maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop with geometric approaches. Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine them with solar irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar potential of a rooftop. 1 Introduction The 21st century is characterized by an ever-increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change in an unprecedented way. Fossil fuels are still our main source of electricity and heat generation, accounting for 42% of the greenhouse gas emissions in 2016 ( 1). Energy efﬁciency and development of renewable energies are presented as the two main approaches to lower these emissions ( 2) and photovoltaic solar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources because of low maintenance and operation costs ( 3). Solar panels can also produce energy anywhere there is enough sunlight without direct impact on the environment, giving the opportunity to produce energy in dense environments such as cities or industrial zones. In order to compute the solar potential of a building rooftop, we need two types of information: how many solar modules can be ﬁtted on a roof section and how much energy each of this module could produce within a year, accounting for the local irradiation and shading.

Introduction\nThe 21st century is characterized by an ever-increasing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions that are contributing to climate change in an unprecedented way. Fossil fuels are still the main source of electricity and heat generation, accounting for 42% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2016. Energy efficiency and the development of renewable energies are presented as the two main approaches to lower these emissions, and photovoltaic solar energy is one of the fastest-growing renewable energy sources due to low maintenance and operation costs. Solar panels can produce energy anywhere there is enough sunlight without direct impact on the environment, making it possible to produce energy in dense environments such as cities or industrial zones.\n\nTo compute the solar potential of a building rooftop, we need two types of information: how many solar modules can be fitted on a roof section and how much energy each module could produce within a year, accounting for local irradiation and shading. This work proposes a methodology to answer these questions, as illustrated in Figure 1.\n\nFigure 1: Workflow for a given building from the initial aerial image to its rooftop solar potential.\n\nFirst, an image segmentation algorithm applied to aerial imagery is used to obtain each roof section 2D geometry and any obstructing objects it may contain (Section 2.1). The roof 3D geometry (pitch/azimuth) is obtained through a combination of geometric methods and a Random Forest algorithm (Section 2.2). Then, the maximum number of modules fitting on a section is computed using a geometric packing algorithm (Appendix). A shading mask is computed from the shadows cast by surrounding buildings and relief, and the specific photovoltaic power is computed from meteorological data, module orientation, and shading effects (Section 2.3). Finally, the total amount of energy produced by a given roof section in a year can be computed by multiplying the number of modules, the module's nominal power, and its specific photovoltaic power.\n\n2.

Building footprints were also obtained from the same source. Roof geometries labels are obtained from the 3D city representations of five different French cities.
