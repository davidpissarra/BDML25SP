However, due to the non-linearity and non-stationarity of heat consumption data, the prediction of the thermal energy demand of DES remains challenging. In this work, we propose a forecasting framework for thermal energy consumption within a district heating system (DHS) based on kernel Support Vector Regression (kSVR) using real-world smart meter data. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to ﬁnd the optimal hyper-parameter for the kSVR model which leads to the superiority of the proposed methods when compared to a state-of-the-art ARIMA model. The average MAPE is reduced to 2.07% and 2.64% for the individual meter-speciﬁc forecasting and for forecasting of societal consumption, respectively. 1 Introduction According to the United Nation Environment Program, ‘cities are a key contributor to climate change’, as urban areas are ‘responsible for 75% of global CO2 emissions’ [ 1]. One of the effective weapons in combating climate change is the district energy system (DES) [ 2], which implies the need for demand- driven thermal energy supply based on real consumption. However, utilities tend to over-supply the DES network to date, as the security of the energy supply must be ensured and the accumulated energy consumption acquired by the consumer side installation of smart meters is solely used for billing purposes. Hence, the behavior of the end-consumer remains largely unknown for the utilities while operating the DES network. Consequently, an accurate forecast of thermal energy demand poses the logical ﬁrst step towards an optimized energy supply of the entire network. The focus of our work is the energy demand forecast of district heating systems (DHS), as it is the majority of the installed DES networks worldwide. Although the performance of statistical forecast methods, e.g. the AR[ 3], ARIMA[ 4,5] or SARIMA [6] models already demonstrate promising results in general, the prediction accuracy of energy load is limited due to the nonlinearity in the underlying time series. Recently, a model using the artiﬁcial neural network (ANN), e.g. [ 7], is proposed to address the nonlinearity present heat consumption/load data. However, the training of ANN is often challenging, as it has the tendency of being trapped in local optima [ 8]. Deeper models like Long Short Time Memory (LSTM) has the capability to model the underlining trend, seasonality, residuals, and external factors [ 9], however the training of such model prerequisites a large amount of data that can not be provided by the vast majority of the utilities. Traditional machine learning methods such as Support Vector Regression (SVR) [ 10], which is equipped with the inherent capability to deal with nonlinearity [ 11], present a compromise. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.SVR-based methods demonstrate their superiority to other machine learning models for heat load prediction in [ 12,13,14]. As the performance and the usability of SVR are greatly affected by the choice of the model hyper-parameters, evolutionary algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) [ 15] are employed to determine the optimal hyper-parameters automatically. Previously, PSO-SVR is proposed in [ 8] for load prediction of a DHS based on the daily heat load data during the heating season acquired from the production plant that demonstrates promising results. In this paper, the main contributions of our work are: (1) a machine learning-based forecast framework enables the use of accumulated heat consumption data acquired with smart meters that are installed on the end-consumer side; (2) the formulation of a PSO-kSVR model that has the inherent capability to deal with the nonlinearity of the underlying data; and (3) to the best of our knowledge, exploring the use of PSO-SVR and accumulated heat consumption for the forecast of energy load with real-world smart meter data on the house-hold level for the ﬁrst time. 2 Accumulated Consumption Data and Data Analysis The smart meter data used in this work is provided by a danish utility with an hourly temporal resolution.
