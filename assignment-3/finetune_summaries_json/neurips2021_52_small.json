However, satellite SIF observations are only available at a coarse spatial resolution (e.g. 3-5km) in most places, making it difﬁcult to determine how individual crop types or farms are doing. This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression task; at training time, we only have access to SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3 km), yet we want to predict SIF at a very ﬁne spatial resolution (30 meters), a 100x increase. We do have some ﬁne- resolution input features (such as Landsat reﬂectance) that are correlated with SIF, but the nature of the correlation is unknown. To address this, we propose Coarsely- Supervised Regression U-Net (CSR-U-Net), a novel approach to train a U-Net for this coarse supervision setting. CSR-U-Net takes in a ﬁne-resolution input image, and outputs a SIF prediction for each pixel; the average of the pixel predictions is trained to equal the true coarse-resolution SIF for the entire image. Even though this is a very weak form of supervision, CSR-U-Net can still learn to predict accurately, due to its inherent localization abilities, plus additional enhancements facilitated by scientiﬁc prior knowledge. CSR-U-Net can resolve ﬁne-grained variations in SIF more accurately than existing averaging-based approaches, which ignore ﬁne-resolution spatial variation during training. CSR-U-Net could also be useful for a wide range of “downscaling” problems in climate science, such as increasing the resolution of global climate models. 1 Introduction Crop production is very sensitive to climate change; rising temperatures and increases in drought can negatively impact crop yield [ 1,2,3]. Monitoring crop productivity in the face of climate change is essential for food security purposes [ 4]. Thus, there have been many attempts to use remote sensing to monitor crop growth from space [ 5]. A common approach is to use vegetation indices (such as NDVI), which are simple combinations of a few spectral bands measured from satellites. However, it has been shown that satellite-based Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) can outperform these vegetation indices for crop yield prediction [ 6,7], as well as for monitoring the effects of drought [ 8] and heat stress [ 9] on vegetation productivity. Unlike vegetation indices, SIF has mechanistic linkages to plant photosynthesis, and can provide more accurate information about plant growth [10, 11]. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: Coarsely-Supervised Regression U-Net (CSR-U-Net). U-Net ﬁgure inspired from [21].. However, SIF is a very difﬁcult signal to measure from space [ 12]. Most available SIF measurements are noisy, and are only available at a coarse spatial resolution [ 13], such as 3\u00023km. Within a large region of many square kilometers, SIF can vary dramatically, depending on crop type, management practices, and genetic varieties. This variation cannot be resolved by existing satellite measurements, due to their coarse spatial resolution [11]. There have been several attempts to predict SIF at ﬁner spatial resolutions, given coarse-resolution SIF measurements and additional data [ 14,13,12,15]. This task is also known as “statistical downscaling.” These works train a supervised machine learning model on large coarse-resolution tiles, to map from auxiliary input variables (averaged across the entire large tile) to the SIF of that tile. Then this trained model is applied on ﬁne-resolution input variables to predict SIF at a ﬁne resolution. Since the input variables are averaged across a large region during training, information about ﬁne-grained spatial variation is lost. Thus, these works only attempt to resolve SIF down to a 0.05-degree (\u00195km) resolution; we ﬁnd that these methods are generally inaccurate at super-ﬁne resolutions such as 30 meters. This problem poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression task. We desire to learn a model that maps from ﬁne-resolution input features to ﬁne-resolution SIF, yet the only supervision available for SIF at training time is at a much coarser resolution. We note that this task (inferring a ﬁne-resolution map of a variable, given only coarse-resolution observations and other auxiliary data) is not exclusive to SIF, but is also applicable to many problems in climate science. For example, global circulation models (GCMs) are frequently used to simulate future climate patterns, but can only predict at a coarse resolution; there is strong interest in downscaling the model outputs to a ﬁner resolution [16,17]. Other similar problems include downscaling soil moisture [ 18], evapotranspiration\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
