In such a scenario, input variables are more difﬁcult to acquire, and thus models have access to limited training data. We present a case study focusing on Lake Erie, where we ﬁnd that tree-based models can yield more accurate predictions than both neural and physically-based models. 1 Introduction Water levels of lakes and rivers have a large impact on surrounding communities. Low water levels during droughts can jeopardize drinking water supply, industrial water use, and shipping routes. High water levels, on the other hand, pose the risk of ﬂooding and endanger not just humans, but also ﬂora and fauna. Researchers believe that climate change makes both extremes of high and low water levels more common [ 6]. As an example, a recent New York Times article reports not only on the danger to homes, businesses, and wildlife of the 2019 ﬂoods in the Great Lakes region, but also the huge societal costs that protective measures incur [ 14]. Precise forecasts of the ﬂow of rivers or streams play a vital role in managing water levels and thus mitigating damage [3]. To this end, we focus on the problem of streamﬂow prediction: predicting the amount of water that ﬂows past a gauging station (typically located in a river), based on meteorological variables and other information such as topology, soil, or land cover data. For example, Figure 1a shows a map of gauging stations around Lake Erie, and Figure 1b visualizes the hydrograph of a speciﬁc station. In this context, we are exploring the complementary roles of physically-based and data-driven models. Instances of the former type explicitly simulate simpliﬁed representations of the processes that underlie streamﬂow, while instances of the latter type do not. Numerous considerations include prediction accuracy, the ability to generalize to different watersheds and so-called ungauged basins, and uncovering scientiﬁc insights about underlying processes. Applications of neural networks to streamﬂow prediction date back more than two decades [ 1,2,7]. The recent work by Kratzert et al. [ 9] takes advantage of abundant historical data—over a decade—to make accurate predictions across hundreds of locations using recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which do indeed beneﬁt from abundant data [ 5]. We examine a slightly different setup, described by Gauch et al. [ 4]: instead of “pointwise” sources of input variables (corresponding to speciﬁc sensors in the environment; for example, temperature readings at a speciﬁc location), our models take as input spatially-distributed measurements (for example, temperature at points on a grid across a watershed). Such observations are more difﬁcult to acquire and frequently not available across \u0003Corresponding author: Martin Gauch, martin.gauch@uwaterloo.ca 33rd Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2019), Vancouver, Canada.40◦N42◦N44◦N 85◦W 80◦W (a) Outlines of the analyzed sub-watersheds, each draining towards a gauging station (black dots). 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014(b) Yearly streamﬂow time series for station 04212100 (Grand River near Painesville, OH). long time spans. Nevertheless, we believe that this problem formulation yields greater potential for generalization to areas that lack any gauging stations. For a speciﬁc case study under this setup, we ﬁnd that tree-based models can yield more accurate predictions than both neural and physically-based models. Hence—as with many applied machine learning problems—we believe that data collection and preparation form the bottleneck to progress. 2 Case Study: Lake Erie Watershed In our study, we use daily streamﬂow measurements at 46gauging stations in the Lake Erie region from 2010 to 2014 as ground truth. These stations divide the watershed into sub-watersheds, each comprised of the area in which all water ﬂows towards the gauging station. Figure 1a shows a map of the46gauging stations and their corresponding sub-watersheds. As independent variables, we use gridded meteorological forcing data, which include hourly meteorological variables of temperature, precipitation, pressure, wind speed, speciﬁc humidity, and short- and longwave radiation with a spatial resolution of around 15 km spanning ﬁve years (2010 to 2014).
