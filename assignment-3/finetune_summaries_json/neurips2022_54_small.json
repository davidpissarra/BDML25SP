The primary source of transportation sector emissions are on-road vehicles, accounting for approximately 74% of global transportation emissions in 2018 [3]. Quantifying the distribution of on-road transportation emissions and creating timely emissions inventories are vital to identify trends, track mitigation efforts, and inform policy decisions. Previous efforts have developed detailed bottom-up on-road emission inventories for the U.S. [4, 5], but do not easily extend globally due to the reliance on vehicle traffic and road data that is not always readily available. EDGAR [6] provides a global inventory for transportation that uses road density as a proxy to spatially distribute emissions. However, some emission estimates for urban centers in EDGAR deviated from other bottom-up inventories [4] by 500%, indicating that road density is not a sufficient proxy for global high-resolution inventories. Carbon Monitor [7] is a global emissions inventory that utilizes a variety of activity data to estimate daily GHG emissions, however the reliance on proprietary traffic data in the ground transportation sector limits the ability to extend to locations where this data is not available. Other methods have used machine learning ( ML) to directly predict emissions, but their ability to generalize globally is unclear [8, 9]. We propose an emissions estimation method that is globally accurate while using openly available input data. It combines remote sensing, geospatial data, and MLwith traditional, “bottom-up\" emissions inventories that directly incorporate region-specific vehicle fleet mix, fuel efficiency, and other emissions factors ( EF) data. This approach, illustrated in Figure 1, is composed of MLmodels to predict road transportation activity and an EFpipeline that translates activity to emissions in a localized fashion. These two independent parts afford continuous improvement as newer data become available. Our contribution is a method that uses ML-predicted road activity along with Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: System architecture for our hybrid emissions estimation model. region-specific emissions factors data to create up-to-date and more accurate global on-road GHG emissions estimates. 2 Data & Methods We formulate the road activity prediction task as a regression problem. We train models to predict average annual daily traffic ( AADT ), or the number of vehicles traveling on a given road segment per day, on average over an entire year. We use ground truth data from the U.S. Highway Performance Monitoring System Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) data set from 2017 [10]. This AADT data is recorded using road-side devices, and is typically only recorded on major highways and arterial (collector) roads. Models trained in the U.S. are then run over both U.S. and global cities for evaluation. OpenStreetMap ( OSM ) [11] road network data is used as input to our models and for associating predicted AADT values with their corresponding physical road segment. While OSM can contain inconsistencies and is not complete, its open access and global availability make it suitable for this work. Convolutional Neural Networks Semantic segmentation convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were trained to predict AADT, using visual RGB satellite imagery and road network data. Separate models were trained using two sources of imagery: Sentinel-2 Level-2A visual RGB at 10 m x 10 m resolution [12], and Planet Labs PlanetScope mosaics at ∼3 m resolution [13]. OSM data is rasterized for the corresponding extent of an input visual image, where each road type (highway, secondary, local) is rasterized independently, and the resulting raster channels are concatenated together to form a three channel image (see Appendix A for associated OSM tags for each road type). This image is combined with the visual image to form a six channel image that is fed to the CNN to predict AADT on a per-pixel basis. We primarily use MANet-based architectures [14] for our segmentation models, with EfficientNet [15] backbones (see Appendix B for full model descriptions). All AADT predictions for a given road segment are averaged to produce a single AADT value for every road within the current geographic extent of the input data. Graph Neural Networks We have also trained graph neural networks (GNNs) [16] to predict AADT. Road networks inherently take the form of a graph structure, and a graph neural network (GNN) can capture road activity and feature dependencies across a range of scales more easily than the image-based CNN segmentation models. GNN s can easily leverage various features assigned to nodes and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
