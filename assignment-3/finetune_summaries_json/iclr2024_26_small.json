In this paper we present an approach for extracting mentions of climate targets from national laws and policies. We create an expert-annotated dataset identifying three categories of target (’Net Zero’, ’Reduction’ and ’Other’ (e.g. renewable energy targets)) and train a classifier to reliably identify them in text. We investigate bias and equity impacts related to our model and identify specific years and country names as problematic features. We explore the dataset generated from applying our classifier to the Climate Policy Radar (CPR) dataset, showcasing the potential for automated data collection and research support in climate policy. Our work represents a significant upgrade in the accessibility of these key climate policy elements for policymakers and researchers. 1 I NTRODUCTION Climate law and policy are a primary lever for national and international climate action. Targets – quantified, measurable expressions of prospective policy outcomes – are a cornerstone of effective climate policy. Targets bolster the credibility of countries’ commitments by setting quantifiable objectives, and inform policy design, implementation and monitoring (Nachmany & Mangan (2018), Andersen et al. (2021), Haarstad (2020)). Data on existing targets addressing climate change is invaluable for policy analysis, and actors engaged in the design or evaluation of national laws and policies often look to targets as a first ‘port of call’ to establish national and international progress and ambition in addressing climate change. Analysis of existing laws and policies is constrained by the (often limited) resources and expertise at the disposal of relevant actors. Common barriers include: (1) key information buried within lengthy, difficult-to-parse documents, and (2) policies and targets being written in many different languages and terminologies (e.g. ”reduce emissions by 50% by 2030, against a 2005 baseline” versus ”double energy production from renewable sources in the next 5 years”). These constraints on time and resources affect all actors working to understand and improve the efficacy of climate laws and policies, including policymakers, academics, NGOs and UN bodies, and are especially acute for those operating under resource constraints, including in low-income countries and communities. In this paper we present an approach for extracting mentions of targets from national climate laws and policies, using paragraph-level classification.

(2023)), Climate Change Laws of the World (CCLW, Grantham Research Institute at the London School of Economics; Climate Pol- icy Radar (2023)), ClimateWatch (World Resources Institute (2022)), and Climate Action Tracker (Climate Action Tracker (2021)) rely on manual extraction of targets (in some cases relying on vol- unteers), limiting their scalability and consuming significant organisational resources. As a result, many only collect targets from NDCs and focus only on economy-wide targets (and not on other types of targets like sectoral targets). This results in a fundamental gap in the analysis of global public and private sector commitments. NLP has been applied to extract climate-related targets before (Schimanski et al. (2023)), but without addressing individual GHGs or economic sectors. Our work extends existing contributions by (1) extending the definitions of emissions reduction and net-zero targets to include those also addressing individual GHGs and sectors of the economy, as these are an important component of a country’s ambition and ability to achieve its economy-wide emissions reduction targets (IPCC (2023)); (2) introducing a new ’Other’ category of targets to capture quantified targets made by governments with mitigation or adaptation objectives that do not explicitly mention emissions reduction, such as reducing deforestation or scaling up renewable energy capacity; and (3) curating a multi-label dataset, enabling each instance to be associated with zero, one, or multiple designated categories. 3 D ATA The data was sourced from the Climate Policy Radar (CPR) database Climate Policy Radar (2024) of national laws and policies and UNFCCC submissions containing over 4,000 documents published by every single national government. We assign the target types ”Net Zero”, ”Reduction” or ”Other” to paragraphs in a multi-label classification setting. A target satisfies three criteria: it (1) contains an aim to achieve a specific outcome, (2) is quantifiable, and (3) has been given a deadline.

This paper presents an approach for extracting mentions of climate targets from national laws and policies. We create an expert-annotated dataset with three categories of targets: 'Net Zero', 'Reduction', and 'Other' (e.g., renewable energy targets). We train a classifier to reliably identify these targets in text and investigate bias and equity impacts related to our model. We also identify specific years and country names as problematic features.
