In particular, the emissions intensity of the power grid varies from moment to moment depending on which generators are producing power, which in turn depends on factors such as the amount of electricity demand and the amount of renewable energy available. There has therefore been a great deal of interest in characterizing both the average andmarginal emissions intensities of the power grid, which capture the emissions associated with different sets of generators producing power at any given time [1–3]. In this proposal, we consider the challenge of forecasting marginal emissions factors (MEFs), which describe the emissions associated with marginal generators (i.e., generators that would respond to small changes in demand at a given time). MEFs are important for a variety of climate-relevant applications, such as optimizing industrial or residential equipment, smart electric vehicle charging, or the design of emissions-cognizant electricity prices [ 4]. Prior work has aimed to develop real-time estimates and forecasts of MEFs using dispatch models [ 5,6], ﬂow tracing [ 7], and machine learning [8]. However, full power system models can be expensive to run, cheaper “reduced form” power models can be extremely sensitive to errors in their inputs, and purely machine learning-based methods can suffer from failures related to a lack of domain knowledge. In this work, we propose to forecast marginal emissions factors in a way that leverages the strengths of both machine learning and (reduced-form) power system models. This is motivated by our initial explorations, which found that naively forecasting MEFs using a neural network or a simple dispatch model suffered from several limitations. We describe this initial exploration as well as our proposed method, which involves incorporating differentiable power system models within neural networks. 2 Problem Statement We seek to develop day-ahead hourly forecasts of CO 2MEFs in the Mid-Atlantic region power pool (PJM), which is the largest competitive wholesale market in the United States. To do so, we plan to employ a combination of weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,1 market data from PJM,2and dispatch models that simulate power system operations (e.g., [9]). 1Seehttps://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/global-hourly. 2Seehttp://dataminer2.pjm.com.

We ﬁnd that neither baseline we consider performs better than a (prescient) persistence baseline that predicts the average MEF over the time period considered. We plan to assess the quality of our forecasts based on their accuracy with respect to the ground truth. However, we ﬁrst acknowledge two important limitations of this metric. One limitation is that there is a lack of ground truth data on MEFs, which has led to a fair amount of work characterizing historical marginal emissions factors via methods such as regression [ 3,10–13]; in our initial approach, we plan to compare accuracy with respect to a proxy “ground truth” simulated using a reduced-order dispatch model (e.g., [ 9]), while acknowledging that these labels may be ﬂawed. Another limitation is that accuracy is not fully reﬂective of the goals of our method, as we would ideally instead measure the extent to which our factors actually help reduce emissions (see, e.g, [ 14]); however, as these factors may be used for many different purposes, we felt that accuracy was the best “generic” metric to use. 2.1 Initial Investigation In our initial investigation, we constructed MEF forecasts using two methods: an end-to-end neural network forecasting method, and a method forecasting inputs to a reduced-order dispatch model. Both models were trained on data from January 2016 to August 2017, and tested on data from September to December 2017. We now describe these aspects in more detail. Ground truth. Due to a lack of actual ground-truth data, we generate “ground truth” MEFs by running the reduced-order dispatch model [ 9] on historical data. This model is open-source and can produce point estimates of MEFs on an hourly basis (whereas historical regression analysis techniques can only compute factors for clusters of hours). We had also considered calculating MEFs directly from historical data from the EPA3by dividing the change in emissions by the change in fossil demand; however, this method led to a large number of outliers due to the outsized impact of small changes in hourly generation or emissions, leading us to rely on simulated factors instead.

The emissions intensity of the power grid varies depending on the generators producing power, which is influenced by factors such as electricity demand and renewable energy availability. To address this, there is a great deal of interest in characterizing the average and marginal emissions intensities of the power grid, which capture the emissions associated with different sets of generators producing power at any given time.\n\nIn this proposal, we consider the challenge of forecasting marginal emissions factors (MEFs), which describe the emissions associated with marginal generators that respond to small changes in demand at a given time. MEFs are crucial for various climate-relevant applications, such as optimizing industrial or residential equipment, smart electric vehicle charging, and designing emissions-cognizant electricity prices.\n\nPrior work has aimed to develop real-time estimates and forecasts of MEFs using dispatch models, flow tracing, and machine learning. However, full power system models can be expensive to run, while cheaper \"reduced form\" power models can be sensitive to errors in their inputs, and purely machine learning-based methods can suffer from a lack of domain knowledge.\n\nWe propose to forecast marginal emissions factors by leveraging the strengths of both machine learning and reduced-form power system models. Our initial explorations found that naively forecasting MEFs using a neural network or a simple dispatch model suffered from several limitations.

To achieve this, we plan to use a combination of weather data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, market data from PJM, and dispatch models that simulate power system operations.\n\n**Forecast Method**\n\nWe will employ a combination of weather data, market data, and dispatch models to forecast MEFs. Our initial investigation involved comparing the performance of three methods: a persistence baseline, a neural network baseline, and a dispatch with forecasted inputs baseline. The results are shown in Table 1.\n\n| Method | RMSE |\n| --- | --- |\n| Persistence baseline | 190.84 |\n| Neural network baseline | 212.25 |\n| Dispatch with forecasted inputs baseline | 213.69 |\n\nWe found that none of the baselines performed better than a persistence baseline that predicts the average MEF over the time period considered. We plan to assess the quality of our forecasts based on their accuracy with respect to the ground truth.\n\n**Limitations**\n\nWe acknowledge two important limitations of our approach. Firstly, there is a lack of ground truth data on MEFs, which has led to the use of historical marginal emissions factors characterized via regression methods. In our initial approach, we will compare accuracy with respect to a proxy \"ground truth\" simulated using a reduced-order dispatch model. Secondly, accuracy is not a perfect measure of the goals of our method, as we would ideally measure the extent to which our factors actually help reduce emissions. However, as these factors may be used for various purposes, we felt that accuracy was the best \"generic\" metric to use.\n\n**Initial Investigation**\n\nIn our initial investigation, we constructed MEF forecasts using two methods: an end-to-end neural network forecasting method and a method forecasting inputs to a reduced-order dispatch model.
