We pursue a latent space clustering approach to map biogeographical regions of frequently co-occurring species and apply this methodology to a dataset from northern Belgium, generat- ing predictive maps illustrating how these regions may expand or contract with changing temperature under a future climate scenario. 1 Introduction Projecting trends in global biodiversity amidst anthropogenic climate change is a challenging problem due to uncertainties in climate forecasts, nonlinear relations between species’ ﬁtness and temperature, and climate-mediated network effects between species [Van der Putten et al., 2010, Garcia et al., 2018]. The disruption of established patterns of species-species interactions threatens to sever critical links required by ecosystems to function properly. For example, changes to the timing and seasonality of ecosystem events such as predation and pollination are likely to be disrupted by climate change [Bartomeus et al., 2011] with concomitant ecosystem-wide effects. Historically, these second-order effects have been challenging to accommodate in empirical species distribution models and thereby lessened the value of existing ecological forecasts which were often dominated by univariate models [Sinclair et al., 2010, Elith et al., 2011]. Unfortunately, past research has shown that omission of interactions between species can compromise the validity of species’ abundance forecasts under future climate change [Mod et al., 2015]. Over the past several decades, collection of data tabulating the co-occurrence of multiple species has driven the development of empirical joint species distribution models. A shared commonality amongst several previous research efforts in statistical ecology [Pollock et al., 2014, Taylor-Rodríguez et al., 2017, Tikhonov et al., 2017, Krapu and Borsuk, 2020] is that these models account for species co-occurrence in a linear fashion, and thereby potentially limit the degree to which more complicated covariance structures may be analyzed. Our interest in this work is to explore the usage of deep generative models for the purpose of joint species distribution modeling. In particular, we seek to analyze the suitability of using a variational autoencoder (V AE) for identifying meaningful low-dimensional structure from plant species pres- ence/absence data with relatively large ( K\u00192500 ) dimension. We use this learned representation as an embedding space for application of clustering algorithms to identify biogeographical regions with strong species assemblage covariance patterns. Locations assigned to the same clusters in the embedding space also share strong correlation patterns in geographic space and appear to cleanly Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.represent biologically meaningful ecoregions shared requirements across species for survival and propagation. Furthermore, we correlate estimates of per-location latent variables with exogenous variables including annual rainfall and temperature, allowing us to provide forecasts for the expansion and contraction of these regions under increased temperature as supplied by the predictions from the MIROC-ESM model within the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, version 6 (CMIP6). We adopt the standard framework for describing variational autoencoders as reviewed in Kingma and Welling [2019] and clarify that we are interested in constructing a probability model p(x;z) over vector-valued random variables X;Z which represent, respectively, the K-dimensional binary vector xof species presence or absence and the corresponding latent vector Z\u0018N(0;IL)which is a real-valued latent representation of xin a low dimensional space.
