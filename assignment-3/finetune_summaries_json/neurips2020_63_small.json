However, correctly identifying butterﬂy species is a challenging task for non-specialists and currently requires the involvement of entomologists to verify the labels of novice users on the website. We have developed a computer vision model to label butterﬂy images from eButterﬂy automatically, decreasing the need for human experts. We employ a model that incorporates geographic and temporal information of where and when the image was taken, in addition to the image itself.

One of the reasons for this is that butterﬂies are highly susceptible to changes in their surrounding environment, such as climate change, habitat loss, and pesticide use [ 1]. In fact, some species of butterﬂies are directly impacted by climate change through their growth and reproduction cycles, such as the Karner Blue butterﬂy ( Lycaeides melissa samuelis ), which is an endangered species. This is in part because warmer temperatures can induce butterﬂy eggs to hatch more quickly while their food source remains dormant, resulting in population decline [ 2]. Butterﬂies can also be indirectly impacted by climate change if their habitat becomes altered. For example, the Rocky Mountain Apollo ( Parnassius smintheus ) and the Monarch ( Danaus plexippus ) have both incurred ecosystem reduction due to indirect effects of climate change on their host plants [3, 4]. Apart from the loss of beautiful and culturally meaningful animals, a reduction in butterﬂy biodiversity could have dire consequences, since butterﬂies play a key role in a multitude of ecosystems. For instance, butterﬂies are important pollinators of many species of ﬂowering plants. A reduction in butterﬂy populations, or even a change in the timing of butterﬂy life cycles, could mean that certain ﬂower species experience a signiﬁcant drop in pollination [ 5]. Butterﬂies are also an important food Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.source for many animals, including birds, lizards, and other insects [ 6,7,8]. Thus, any changes in butterﬂy populations can trigger a “butterﬂy effect\" and impact other parts of ecosystems, potentially resulting in far-reaching repercussions. In order to understand changes in butterﬂy populations and employ appropriate conservation measures, it is important to track the distribution and abundance of butterﬂies. eButterﬂy is a website developed by a coalition of researchers across the United States and Canada, to which individuals are able to upload images of butterﬂies from any location and identify the species to which they belong [ 9]. Analyzing these butterﬂy images and the observational data that accompanies them can offer valuable information on changes in geographical and temporal distribution. However, it is important to ﬁrst obtain accurate labels for individual butterﬂy species. While any user of the eButterﬂy website can upload an image, they may not necessarily know the species, since ﬁne-grained butterﬂy identiﬁcation can be challenging for novice entomologists. We leverage machine learning to automate the labelling process, allowing experts to focus only on the most challenging identiﬁcations and alleviating a bottleneck that has held back the eButterﬂy project. 2 Related Work There has been extensive work on using images taken by photographers or camera traps for automatic identiﬁcation of animal species, including birds, mammals, ground-dwelling insects, bees, and more (see e.g. [ 10,11,12,13,14,15,16]). Recent work has proposed to improve such image-based identiﬁcation systems using complementary information, such as spatiotemporal distribution [ 17,18]. The motivation behind this is that visually similar species may be present in different geographic regions and at different periods of the year, and therefore knowing where and when a picture was taken may be useful information for ﬁne-grained classiﬁcation. The authors of [ 17] developed a spatiotemporal prior that estimates the probability of a species being present based on where and when the image was taken, and applied this model especially to bird identiﬁcation. However, little work has applied such ideas to the problem of butterﬂy classiﬁcation, which to date has been carried out largely based on pure image\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
