Furthermore, we explain how the proposed benchmark will facilitate the use of Machine Learning techniques in grid ﬂexibility applications. 1 I NTRODUCTION Demand response (DR) or grid ﬂexibility (GF) encompasses the ability of end-customers to change their energy consumption in response to incentives, with the goal of improving the operation of the power grid. Typically, examples of DR include Time-of-Use tariffs, where consumers are offered different electricity prices at different times of the day (such having a cheaper electricity price during the night) or direct control of appliances such as water heaters by a central utility (without impacting the comfort of users). 1.1 M OTIVATION Climate change is one of the biggest challenges ever faced by humanity. A recent book by Hawken (2017), compiles a list of techniques to help reverse climate change. Regarding grid ﬂexibility, it mentions that the impact was not measured because the system is too complex to properly assess its beneﬁts. Even though demand response is a vital tool for enabling the energy transition and the deployment of renewable resources, there seems to be no reliable and reproducible measure for the performance of such techniques. Consider a small low voltage (LV) grid1with several households and no demand response program in place. One could wonder what is the most effective (in terms of consumption change and cost of implementation) DR program that could be deployed. Should we encourage users to install smart appliances and a Home Energy Management System (HEMS)? If there are appliances, is it better to use dynamic pricing, create local energy markets or directly pay users to gain the control of their HEMS? Would the results change if there were electric vehicles in every household? 1.2 T HE ROLE OF BENCHMARKS Standardized datasets and benchmarks exist and are important in many STEM areas. For example, in the artiﬁcial intelligence community, image recognition is arguably one of the most developed areas of research. There are many reasons for this, but the fact that anyone can develop a machine learning algorithm, evaluate it on a dataset such as MNIST (Deng, 2012) and know whether the implementation is working as expected is a major beneﬁt. In particular, for the MNIST dataset there are leaderboards that contain the performance of several algorithms2. Even though the superior performance of one algorithm over another one for a speciﬁc dataset should not be sufﬁcient to 1A LV grid is deﬁned as the power grid behind the last Medium V oltage to Low V oltage transformer. The vast majority of households are connected in a LV grid. 2http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/ 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 claim that one is better than the other, such comparison across different datasets might be a good indicator. Benchmarks are not exclusive of the Image Recognition community. Indeed, examples in other areas include: community detection in graphs (Lancichinetti et al., 2008) and natural language processing (Wang et al., 2019). Even in the power system community, the IEEE X-BUS systems (Kersting, 1991), (IEEE, 1979) provide benchmarking capabilities for some applications, but not for DR. In addition, Pecan Street (Smith, 2009) offers some benchmarking capabilities as a service. 1.3 B ENCHMARK SPECIFICATION Drawing a parallelism with the image processing community: the deﬁnition of an image is clear. It is a 3 dimensional matrix where each entry represents one of the RGB values of a pixel (for coloured images). Once everyone agreed in what an image is, many benchmarks (datasets) could be designed to solve different tasks: images with text, with objects, with faces, etc. There is not a clear analogous deﬁnition of what an “image“ is in Smart Grids, in particular for DR applications. In this section we take the ﬁrst steps towards a deﬁnition that will enable the systematic treatment of DR programs. The requirements can be divided into four categories: 1. Energy Generation. 2. Power Grid Speciﬁcation.3. Consumer Speciﬁcation. 4. Performance Metrics. A brief description of each one of them can be found below, and we provide a longer description in the Appendix. Energy Generation The amount of produced energy available for consumption, its sources and their respective location in the grid should be key components of a demand response benchmark. In particular, the information of how much renewable energy is available at each point in time will be needed for measuring DR performance as the ability to match consumption and renewable generation. Another piece of information that might be relevant consists on weather information such as temperature and cloud cover. That kind of information will be needed in more precise studies dealing with seasonal effects of demand response\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nIntroduction to Demand Response and Grid Flexibility\n\nDemand response (DR) or grid flexibility (GF) refers to the ability of end-customers to adjust their energy consumption in response to incentives, aiming to improve the operation of the power grid. This can be achieved through various methods, such as time-of-use tariffs, where consumers are offered different electricity prices at different times of the day, or direct control of appliances by a central utility without impacting user comfort.\n\nMotivation\n\nClimate change is one of the most significant challenges humanity faces. A recent book by Hawken (2017) highlights various techniques to reverse climate change, including grid flexibility. However, the impact of grid flexibility has not been measured due to the complexity of the system. Despite demand response being a vital tool for enabling the energy transition and deploying renewable resources, there is a lack of reliable and reproducible measures for evaluating its performance. For instance, consider a small low-voltage grid with several households and no demand response program in place. It is unclear what the most effective DR program would be in terms of consumption change and cost of implementation. Should users be encouraged to install smart appliances and a Home Energy Management System (HEMS)? Would dynamic pricing, local energy markets, or direct payment to users for controlling their HEMS be more effective? The results might differ if every household had electric vehicles.\n\nThe Role of Benchmarks\n\nStandardized datasets and benchmarks are essential in various STEM fields, such as artificial intelligence. For example, in image recognition, the MNIST dataset (Deng, 2012) allows researchers to develop and evaluate machine learning algorithms. Leaderboards containing the performance of several algorithms are also available. Similarly, benchmarks exist in other areas, such as community detection in graphs (Lancichinetti et al., 2008) and natural language processing (Wang et al., 2019). In the power system community, the IEEE X-BUS systems (Kersting, 1991) and (IEEE, 1979) provide benchmarking capabilities for some applications, but not for DR. Pecan Street (Smith, 2009) also offers benchmarking capabilities as a service.\n\nBenchmark Specification\n\nTo create a benchmark for demand response, we need a clear definition of what constitutes a \"demand response\" in Smart Grids. This definition should enable the systematic treatment of DR programs. The requirements can be divided into four categories:\n\n1. Energy Generation: The amount of produced energy available for consumption, its sources, and their respective locations in the grid should be key components of a demand response benchmark. This includes information on renewable energy availability and weather conditions, such as temperature and cloud cover.\n\n2. Power Grid Specification: This category includes the details of the power grid, such as its structure and operation.\n\n3. Consumer Specification: This category involves the characteristics of the consumers, including their energy consumption patterns and behavior.\n\n4. Performance Metrics: This category includes the metrics used to evaluate the performance of demand response programs, such as the ability to match consumption and renewable generation.\n\nA more detailed description of each category can be found in the Appendix."
