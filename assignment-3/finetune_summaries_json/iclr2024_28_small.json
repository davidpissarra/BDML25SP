However, the delayed (by one year) tra- ditional estimates of ocean-atmosphere CO 2flux hinder timely understanding and response to the global carbon cycle’s dynamics. Addressing this challenge, we introduce Carbon Monitor Ocean (CMO-NRT), a pioneering dataset provid- ing near-real-time, monthly gridded estimates of global surface ocean fugacity of CO 2(fCO 2) and ocean-atmosphere CO 2flux from January 2022 to July 2023. This dataset marks a significant advancement by updating the global carbon bud- get’s estimates through a fusion of data from 10 Global Ocean Biogeochemical Models (GOBMs) and 8 data products into a near-real-time analysis framework. By harnessing the power of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and semi- supervised learning techniques, we decode the complex nonlinear relationships between model or product estimates and observed environmental predictors. The predictive models, both for GOBM and data products, exhibit exceptional accu- racy, with root mean square errors (RMSEs) maintaining below the 5%threshold. This advancement supports more effective climate change mitigation efforts by providing scientists and policymakers with timely and accurate data. 1 I NTRODUCTION The ocean is a pivotal component in the Earth’s climate system, acting as a major sink for anthro- pogenic heat and carbon dioxide (CO2). This crucial role underscores the necessity for timely and accurate estimates of the global ocean carbon sink to inform climate change mitigation efforts and support the global stocktake process under the Paris Climate Agreement.

(2022) due to com- putational and data gathering constraints. This latency hinders the timely assessment and response to the changing state of global carbon sinks, emphasizing the need for more immediate data solutions. In response to this need, numerous methodologies have been developed, utilizing both in situ mea- surements and global ocean biogeochemical models (GOBMs) to estimate surface ocean fugacity ofCO 2(fCO 2), surface ocean partial pressure of CO 2(pCO 2) and air-sea CO 2flux. The Surface Ocean CO 2Atlas ( www.socat.info ) (SOCAT ), a community-led database, has played a central role by providing a comprehensive repository of quality-controlled surface ocean fCO 2measure- ments. These data, spanning from 1957 to 2022 in its latest update Bakker et al. (2016), form the backbone of observation-based products that estimate pCO 2across the globe. These products leverage sparse pCO 2observations from SOCAT, applying multivariate linear regression or machine learning algorithms alongside observations of related variables to estimate pCO 2at any given loca- tion and times (Landsch ¨utzer et al., 2016; R ¨odenbeck et al., 2022; Chau et al., 2022; Gloege et al., 2022; Watson et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2014; Iida et al., 2021; Gregor & Gruber, 2021).
