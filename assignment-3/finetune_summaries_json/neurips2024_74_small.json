However, the computational cost of downscaling Global Climate Models (GCMs) to the fine resolutions needed for such applications presents a significant barrier. Drawing on advancements in weather forecasting models, this study introduces a cost-efficient downscaling method using a pretrained Earth Vi- sion Transformer (Earth ViT) model. Initially trained on ERA5 data to downscale from 50 km to 25 km resolution, the model is then tested on the higher resolution BARRA-SY dataset at a 3 km resolution. Remarkably, it performs well without additional training, demonstrating its ability to generalize across different reso- lutions. This approach holds promise for generating large ensembles of regional climate simulations by downscaling GCMs with varying input resolutions without incurring additional training costs. Ultimately, this method could provide more comprehensive estimates of potential future changes in key climate variables, aid- ing in effective planning for extreme weather events and climate change adaptation strategies. 1 Introduction Global Climate model simulations are usually produced at coarse resolutions due to the significant computational requirements involved in running these models World Climate Research Programme (2014). These models typically operate at resolutions ranging from tens to hundreds of kilometers, which are inadequate for capturing fine-scale atmospheric processes, such as convection, that drive extreme weather events Solman et al.(2021). Additionally, finer resolutions are needed for certain meteorological variables, like soil moisture content and precipitation, to aid in extreme weather events planning and prediction Sun et al. (2019); Rampal et al. (2024). Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have demonstrated the ability to model the underly- ing dynamics of the atmosphere. Models like Pangu, Graphcast, Gencast, and NeuralGCM have successfully captured fine-scale meteorological patterns and shown promising results in various climate-related tasks Bi et al.(2022); Lam et al.(2022); Lai et al.(2023); Dueben et al.(2023). ∗d.curran@unsw.edu.au †h.saleem@unsw.edu.au ‡s.hobeichi@unsw.edu.au §flora.salim@unsw.edu.au Preprint. Under review.These models leverage deep learning to enhance the spatial and temporal resolution of climate data, providing insights that were previously unattainable with traditional ML methods. However, most of these models are trained and tested on specific datasets and resolutions, limiting their ability to generalise to new input datasets with finer resolutions. In assessing the risks associated with climate change, it’s crucial to consider a comprehensive range of possible changes to key climate variables, such as temperature and precipitation, at regional or local scales Rampal et al.(2024). This approach helps address uncertainties in climate models, emissions, and the contributions of natural variability. Traditional methods often rely on using Regional Climate Models (RCMs) to downscale outputs from GCMs in a process known as dynamical downscaling. While effective, this approach is highly computationally intensive Rampal et al.(2024). For example, the New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory Regional Climate Modelling (NARCliM) NARCLiM2.0 regional simulations required 14 to 18 months to complete projections to 2100, using the best computational resources available in Australia from the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) Nishant et al.(2021). This effort cost $14 million and produced an ensemble of 30 simulations. Given the limitations of downscaling a large ensemble of GCMs with RCMs, there is a need for alternative approaches that can generate extensive ensembles of plausible future climate scenarios with robust uncertainty estimates Bittner et al.(2023),Hobeichi et al.(2023). Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution to supplement or enhance existing global or regional climate modeling efforts Rampal et al. (2024). Given that GCMs are available at various resolutions, an ML model that is agnostic to input resolution could enable the downscaling of a large number of GCMs, regardless of their original resolution. Due to its affordability and significantly lower computational cost at the inference stage compared to running an RCM, such an ML model could facilitate the generation of large ensembles, providing a more comprehensive estimate of potential future changes in rainfall and other key climate variables. To explore this potential, a pretrained ML-based downscaling algorithm, the Earth Vision Transformer (Earth ViT), was tested on climate/weather data at much higher resolutions than those on which it was originally trained. Additionally, we introduce an amendment to the loss function to penalise results that violate the law of conservation of mass, ensuring that the value of a coarse grid accurately reflects the cumulative property of the enclosed region within its boundary. This step is important for making the ML model more physically consistent Sun et al. (2024). 2\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
