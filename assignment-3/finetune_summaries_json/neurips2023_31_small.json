To better prepare for and react to the increas- ing threat of wildfires, more accurate fire modelers and mitigation responses are necessary. In this paper, we introduce SimFire, a versatile wildland fire projec- tion simulator designed to generate realistic wildfire scenarios, and SimHarness, a modular agent-based machine learning wrapper capable of automatically gen- erating land management strategies within SimFire to reduce the overall dam- age to the area. Together, this publicly available system allows researchers and practitioners the ability to emulate and assess the effectiveness of firefighter in- terventions and formulate strategic plans that prioritize value preservation and resource allocation optimization.

Severe wildfires pose a significant threat to life, property, ecology, cultural heritage, and critical infrastructure - in 2022 alone, over 7.6 million acres of land was burned due to wildfires across the United States [3] costing over 3.5 billion dollars in suppression costs [4]. While wildfires are an essential natural occurrence for maintaining healthy ecological systems [5], uncontrolled fires, particularly those close to the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI), can present significant risks to public health, life and property, necessitating effective management or suppression measures. In this paper, we introduce SimFire and SimHarness, a Python-based system to accurately model wildland fire spread and generate appropriate mitigation strategy responses via Reinforcement Learning (RL). SimFire utilizes the Rothermel fire spread formula [6] to simulate the movement of wildland fire through an environment generated from real-world operational or procedurally generated fictional data. Simulated agents can be added to the generated environment and place firefighter- induced mitigations to visualize how wildfires will react to specific mitigation strategies. SimHarness is a machine learning harness designed to train RL agents within SimFire to identify the optimal mitigation strategies for a given wildfire scenario. The combination of SimFire and SimHarness provides a customizable system designed to simulate the spread of wildland fire through a generated ∗Corresponding author.

SimFire and SimHarness aims to derive even more insights for planners and mitigators by leveraging agent-based machine learning that identifies the optimal strategies for addressing wildland fire scenarios. In recent years, there has been an increase of academics studying RL for disaster relief and response. In [11, 12], both provide open-source RL environments and models for training agents to mitigate the spread of wildfire to limit overall damage. Altamimi [13] similarly trains an RL agent to mitigate the spread of wildfire through an environment, but does not include open-source code. In all these cases, the environments do not support using real-world data during terrain generation or true fire-spread models such as Rothermel [6]. SimFire aims to fill this gap with realistic environments, research-backed fire spread capabilities, and a design that supports further improvement by the open-source community. Similarly, SimHarness’ modular structure makes it compatible with any disaster modeler that utilizes the required Simulation API - not just wildland fire - making SimHarness more flexible than current frameworks and extensible for a variety of disaster scenarios. 2 Background and Preliminaries 2.1 Rothermel Fire Projection The Rothermel surface fire spread model has been widely used in the field of fire and fuels manage- ment since 1972 [6]. To model the spread of fire across a given surface, the Rothermel equation takes fuel moisture and wind into account for weather conditions, and slope and elevation into account for terrain conditions. These environmental conditions, weather and terrain, pair with input fuel complexity values to determine the spread of a fire throughout an environment. While Rothermel is considered a valuable tool for estimating the rate of fire spread under certain conditions, its accuracy and applicability can vary depending on factors such as the specific environmental conditions, fuel types, and terrain. Researchers and practitioners often use Rothermel as part of a suite of tools with weather data to better understand and manage wildfires. 2.2 Reinforcement Learning Reinforcement learning is an agent-based sub-field of machine learning that utilizes a user-designed reward function to train an intelligent agent how to interact within\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
