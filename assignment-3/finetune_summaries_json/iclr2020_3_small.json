However, missing imputation and STLF have been considered independently so far. In this paper, we jointly consider missing imputation and STLF and propose a family of autoencoder/LSTM combined mod- els to realize missing-insensitive STLF. Speciﬁcally, autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), and convolutional autoencoder (CAE) are investigated for ex- tracting features, which is directly fed into the input of LSTM. Our results show that three proposed autoencoder/LSTM combined models signiﬁcantly improve forecasting accuracy compared to the baseline models of deep neural network and LSTM. Furthermore, the proposed CAE/LSTM combined model outperforms all other models for 5%-25% of random missing data. 1 I NTRODUCTION Greenhouse gas emission causes severe environmental hazards like climate change, and reducing power generation and consumption is an important objective of the smart grid (Khan et al., 2016). In doing this, short-term load forecasting (STLF) plays a pivotal role; STLF is being used by power system operators for preparing the proper amount of electricity supply. Thus, accurate STLF can prevent excessive power generation reserve and lower the use of fossil fuels, which in turn leads to mitigate climate change (Yaslan & Bican, 2017). Furthermore, based on accurate STLF, demand response can actively change the electric usage of users with a high price of electricity in peak hours or by giving an incentive as a reward of lowering the power consumption (Pramono et al., 2019). Recently, artiﬁcial intelligence techniques are widely used for STLF, such as artiﬁcial neural net- work (ANN) (Czernichow et al., 1996), deep neural network (DNN) (Ryu et al., 2017), recurrent neural network (RNN) (Vermaak & Botha, 1998), and long short-term memory (LSTM) (Kong et al., 2017a;b; Choi et al., 2018). However, in practice, data can be lost because of communications error, mechanical failure or loss of power (Li et al., 2018), and missing imputation has become critical. So far missing value of load data is ﬁlled with zero or average value using linear regression method, where learning models are usually created by separating missing imputation and other tasks such as forecasting or clustering. In this paper, we propose a novel method by merging missing imputation into one of the steps in STLF. This model focuses on high forecasting accuracy under random missing and block missing data. In doing this, we leverage the unsupervised learning capability of autoencoder (AE) and the feature extraction of convolutional neural network. The intuition is such that an AE extracts impor- tant attributes (Ryu et al., 2019), which are used as an input to LSTM. Thus, even though there are some missing values in time domain, the features extracted by the autoencoder might be insensitive to missing values. We consider autoencoder (AE), denoising autoencoder (DAE), and convolutional autoencoder (CAE) for feature extraction. We summarize our key contributions as follows. First, missing imputation and forecasting need not be performed separately. Instead, we propose a uniﬁed forecasting technique that is insensitive to missing values. The proposed method achieves accurate forecasting in the presence of severe 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2020 Figure 1: CAE/LSTM combined model. missing rate, e.g., up to 25%. Second, using two-dimensional image data and two-dimensional convolution, we extract the features of the data in the presence of severe missing data. As missing rate increases, performance improvement over the conventional method also becomes signiﬁcant. Third, we perform extensive experiments using not only CAE but also AE and DAE. We conﬁrm that the proposed model outperforms the conventional model separating missing imputation and forecasting. 2 M ETHODS 2.1 O VERALL PROCESS The overall process of STLF is divided into three main steps: data preprocessing, training, and test.
