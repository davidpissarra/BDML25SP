Introduction\n\nClimate change is arguably humanity's primary challenge, demanding urgent and decisive action in line with the Paris Agreement. Land use is a key component, accounting for approximately 25% of total greenhouse gases (GHG). Land use includes a wide range of critical issues, from deforestation and forest degradation through agriculture. The domain is particularly challenging, given that the world's growing population and rising standards of living exert an increasing pressure on food and consumer goods production, both of which may lead to conflicting objectives with climate change and biodiversity. The REDD+ program (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) is the UNFCCC's scheme for the reduction of emissions caused by forest protection measures. However, designing effective REDD+ policies and actions, assessing their GHG impact, and linking them with corresponding payments, is a resource-intensive and complex task for which there is considerable room for improvement, also with respect to private sector involvement. There are delays in implementation, inconsistencies in reported data, insufficient levels of transparency, and as a result, a lack of actionable projects. Current efforts fall short of fully leveraging the process and technology options available today. The net result is insufficient climate action in the land management domain (including biodiversity protection) and a collective failure to meet the climate targets set.\n\nWe propose GainForest, an interpretable machine learning system that addresses concrete needs to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) processes in relation to forest conservation efforts and climate finance instruments that rely on MRV to incentivize sustainable land-use practices, as well as Payment for Ecosystem Services and biodiversity schemes that promote public and private investment in sustainable land-use activities. GainForest integrates large amounts of unlabeled satellite imagery with labeled authoritative data from forest zoning and plot ownership to predict land use change. Interpretable machine learning approaches can then be used to guide fair performance and model-based climate payments.\n\n2. Predicting Forest Change\n\nFigure 1: Given past deforestation patterns from Global Forest Watch (left image), a video prediction model is able to forecast in which regions a deforestation pattern is likely to spread to in the near future (blue boxes, right image).\n\nRemote sensing, such as satellite imagery, is increasingly important in ecosystem monitoring. Although it provides a huge supply of data and detailed resolutions (Digital Globe provides imagery up to 0.3m per pixel), many downstream tasks are constrained by a lack of labels. Current forest change alert systems, such as FORMA (Wheeler et al., 2018), are constrained to train shallow supervised classifiers on handcrafted features to detect clear cuts in low resolutions (250m per pixel). Furthermore, in humid regions where clouds are covering large parts of forests, it can sometimes take months until forest change is detected and an alert is raised. Assessment of forest change suitable for performance-based payments, such as the UN's REDD+ program, is usually limited to a yearly basis (often leveraging a mosaic of numerous clear satellite imagery combined with on-site measurements).\n\n2.1.

Local stakeholders in respective regions can be queried by the system to provide additional information and validate the predictions, enabling more accurate and effective climate action."
