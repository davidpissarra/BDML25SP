In 2022, data centers consumed approximately 460 TWh, accounting for around 2%of the global total electricity usage [1]. This large-scale energy consumption contributes to a significant portion of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions [2]. Additionally, training large language models such as GPT-3 in data centers can directly evaporate 700,000liters of freshwater, let alone the additional water usage for inference to serve millions of user requests [3]. To mitigate the environmental impact, industries have implemented various measures, including the adoption of green infrastructure such as wide-scale renewable energy, climate-aware cooling, hardware reuse, geographical workload balancing, and carbon-aware computing [4 –11]. However, these solutions often lead to disproportionate benefits, causing certain regions to bear a heavier environmental burden due to an uneven distribution of computational loads. For example, a Google data center in Finland benefits from 23 times more green energy (and less fossil-fuel air pollution) compared to a facility in Singapore [12, 13], creating a regional disparity in carbon emissions. Similarly, Nordic countries exhibit better water efficiency (<1.0 L/kWh) compared to hotter regions (9.0 L/kWh), making water consumption in areas like Arizona disproportionately high [14]. Additionally, existing load shifting techniques such as geographical load balancing (GLB, which shifts workloads across different data centers) create unintentional disparities since their focus on minimizing the total energy consumption and carbon emissions can inadvertently increase water footprints putting severe stresses on limited freshwater resources and further exacerbate the uneven distribution of water usage. To address these regional disparities in environmental impact, an equitable GLB approach offers a promising solution. By prioritizing areas with greater environmental disadvantages and providing flexibility in spatial and temporal workload scheduling, this approach can help ensure a more balanced distribution of environmental burdens. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Some recent studies [14] have also tackled equitable GLB using a dual mirror descent approach, but they only consider delay-sensitive AI inference workloads without exploiting deferrable workloads (e.g., AI model training and back-end processing). In contrast, our algorithm EquiShift leverages the spatial-temporal scheduling flexibility of data center workloads and employs Model Predictive Control ( MPC ) [15], enabling dynamic and adaptable workload shifting in an equitable manner. 2 Problem Formulation We model delay-tolerant energy-intensive workloads, such as ML training tasks, that can be flexibly distributed among Ngeographically dispersed data centers connected via a common network. These workloads are suitable for deferral because they are not often time-sensitive, allowing them to be rerouted to data centers that are less environmentally impacted in a dynamic manner. Each data center i∈[1, N]receives a portion yi(t)of the total incoming workload λ(t)at time t∈[1, T], where Tis the time horizon. The associated energy cost, water usage, and carbon emissions at each data center are denoted by fi(yi(t)),wi(yi(t)), and ci(yi(t)), respectively, and are also time-varying functions for which we omit the time index for brevity. EquiShift minimizes the total energy cost while also reducing the maximum water and carbon footprints among the data centers (i.e., minimax). By prioritizing the regions most affected by water usage and carbon emissions, EquiShift ensures an equitable and sustainable distribution of these impacts over the entire time horizon T. min y\"TX t=1NX i=1fi(yi(t)) +κw  max iTX t=1wi(yi(t))! +κc  max iTX t=1ci(yi(t))!# (1a) s.t.NX i=1yi(t)≤λ(t) +δ(t−1),∀t (1b) TX t=1NX i=1yi(t) =TX t=1λ(t), (1c) yi(t)≤Mi,∀i, t (1d) In Eqn.
