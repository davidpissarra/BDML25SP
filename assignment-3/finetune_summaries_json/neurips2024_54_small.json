We introduce an efficient deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting, capable of predicting rainfall up to 8 hours in advance with greater accuracy than existing operational physics-based and extrapolation-based models. Our model leverages multi-source meteorological data and physics-based forecasts to deliver high-resolution predictions in both time and space. It captures complex spatio-temporal dynamics through temporal attention networks and is optimized using data quality maps and dynamic thresholds. Experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art, and highlight its potential for fast reliable responses to evolving weather conditions. 1 Introduction Precipitation nowcasting can play a vital role in adapting to the impacts of climate change by providing accurate, high-resolution forecasts of rainfall intensity over a short period of up to 24 hours. This is a challenging task due to the sparse and non-Gaussian nature of precipitation. Additionally, climate change is making heavy precipitation events more frequent and altering their nature [1], increasing the uncertainty in predicting such rainfall. Since the 1870s, Denmark has experienced a 20% increase in annual precipitation [2]. More intense rainfall increases the risk of flooding, which can disrupt energy supplies by damaging infrastructure or prompting power outages for safety. Denmarkâ€™s Climate Status and Outlook 2022 [3] notes that changes in precipitation, temperature, and wind have previously caused significant fluctuations in carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions from electricity and heating sectors, varying by up to +/- 5 million tonnes of CO2e, mainly due to weather conditions like cold winters and fluctuating precipitation. This emphasizes the need for effective precipitation nowcasting to improve planning, prevention, and adaptation to the effects of climate change. In agriculture, the main focus of Cordulus, precipitation nowcasting can contribute to combating climate change by reducing fuel consumption for unsuccessful trips to fields during unfavorable weather, optimizing timing of grain harvesting and drying to reduce energy use and dry matter loss, enhancing spray efficiency by dosage of products for weather conditions, and preventing product waste by scheduling plant protection treatments at optimal times. Current operational methods for precipitation nowcasting include Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models and optical flow models like PySteps [4] and RainyMotion [5]. NWP models solve Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.mathematical equations [6] wrt. initial and boundary conditions. To improve forecast accuracy, ensemble NWP systems use multiple simulations with varying conditions [7]. Optical flow tracks radar echoes and projects their movement, assuming constant intensity. Both approaches have limitations. NWP models demand significant compute, especially for ensembles, which restricts their spatial and temporal resolution. Their long convergence time makes them ill-suited for short-term precipitation nowcasting, where accurate forecasts are needed for the initial hours. On the other hand, optical flow methods may overestimate precipitation and may not accurately cover all areas [8]. Deep learning models demonstrate enhanced forecasting accuracy, particularly in per-grid-cell metrics, by optimizing directly with fewer biases. These models leverage advanced GPUs to produce forecasts within seconds [9] and excel at capturing complex, non-linear precipitation patterns due to their ability to analyze high-dimensional data. However, forecasting rain remains challenging due to the rapidly changing nature of atmospheric conditions and the variability in precipitation over short distances and times. Research has mainly focused on short-term forecasts (1 to 3 hours) using e.g. convolutional LSTMs [9], spatio-temporal memory flows [10], adversarial training [8], latent diffusion models [11, 12], physical evolution schemes [13], recurrent residual gates [14], and transformers [15]. In operational settings, MetNet-3 [16] and Pangu-Weather [17] are leading deep learning models in the US and Europe, respectively. MetNet-3 is a transformer-based model providing high-resolution precipitation forecasts for up to 24 hours. Pangu-Weather, also transformer-based with hierarchical temporal aggregation, offers forecasts of multiple variables for up to 168 hours but relies on ERA5 data, which has known biases for precipitation and much lower resolution [18]. We introduce the first deep learning model for precipitation nowcasting for up to 8 hours that outperforms existing operational physics-based and extrapolation-based models in Denmark. Our model leverages multiple data sources of atmospheric conditions and physics-based forecasts, captures spatio-temporal dynamics, and is optimized via quality maps and dynamic thresholds. 2 Approach: multi-source temporal attention The Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI) provides radar composite data that captures rainfall intensities at 10-minute intervals with a resolution of 500 meters per pixel1. Still, its range is limited due to its ground-based nature (cf. Fig. A.1). To provide a more comprehensive view of the atmospheric state, we propose to complement the radar data with additional data from geostationary EUMETSAT satellites2covering broader regions, but with lower resolution. We obtain physical properties from GFS satellite imagery3, which provides forecasts with a spatial resolution of 0.25\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
