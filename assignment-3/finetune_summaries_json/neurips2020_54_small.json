They play a vital ecological role, serving as keystone species and a barometer of the health of our environment [ 5]. They provide a direct, critical food source for humans as well as for at least 137 other animal species, including orcas, bears, and wolves [ 5]. Unfortunately, many salmonid populations are threatened due to dams, hatcheries, loss of habitat, excessive ﬁshing, and climate change. The U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service has listed 28 distinct U.S. salmon and steelhead populations as critically endangered or threatened with extinction under the U.S. Endangered Species Act [ 17]. Nearly all of the salmonid species on the U.S. West Coast listed under the Endangered Species Act are highly vulnerable to expected increases in stream temperatures, sea surface temperatures, and ocean acidiﬁcation [ 3]. The southern extent of their range is expected to contract, and their ability to successfully adapt is limited as a result of other anthropogenic changes, such as dams and habitat destruction [ 3]. Other populations are healthy, and with proper management they are providing an important source of food and supporting the large economies associated with commercial and recreational ﬁshing [5]. To restore and maintain a stable population of ﬁsh, ensure the survival of threatened populations, and guide catch limits for non-threatened populations, ﬁshery management practices must be accurate, comprehensive, timely, and cost-efﬁcient. Data-driven estimates of escapement, the number of ﬁsh that have made it safely upstream to spawn, are used to ensure a sustainable population is maintained. Where populations are threatened with extinction, escapement estimates are used to evaluate the effectiveness of recovery strategies. Accurate estimates are also essential to supporting the successful management of commercial and recreational ﬁsheries. Catch-limit regulations and a ﬁshing season’s start and end dates are determined via these estimates. There are currently a handful of different methods used to count returning salmonids, including human observers in ﬁsh towers, ﬁsh wheels, 1Code available at https://github.com/gvanhorn38/ﬁsh_eye Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.and technicians hand-counting ﬁsh in sonar videos. Each of these methods represents a tradeoff between accuracy, cost, and efﬁciency — our work focuses on sonar-based methods. This paper presents a system to automatically detect and track ﬁsh in ARIS frames, allowing estimates of escapement to scale to 24 hours per day, with near-real-time monitoring across large numbers of sites, a feat that is beyond the capabilities and resources of human-based monitoring efforts. From detected ﬁsh tracks our system can produce a total count of ﬁsh swimming upstream and downstream, as well as an estimate of the length of each ﬁsh. Our method uses the latest advances in computer vision detection methods, and while the individual components of our system are not novel, the system as a whole is a novel application of machine learning to the domain of counting river ﬁsh in ARIS data. The review and analysis of this system will be beneﬁcial for future projects with similar goals. 2 Related Works Sonar Data : For decades, ecologists have used sonar data to monitor ﬁsh populations [ 2,16].

[ 12] studied different regularization techniques to combat ﬁsh length and ﬁsh density challenges. Filip Mandic et al.
