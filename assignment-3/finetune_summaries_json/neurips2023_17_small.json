In this work we adapt the graph-based NeurWP approach to the limited area setting and propose a multi-scale hierarchical model extension. Our approach is validated by experiments with a local model for the Nordic region. 1 Introduction Accurately forecasting weather is an immense challenge, but also a problem with broad impact on society. Today, Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) systems combine vast amounts of physics knowledge with powerful computational resources in order to model the atmosphere. Performing these computations is however time-consuming, limiting the possibility to model finer resolutions and detect rare events [ 1]. Forecasting these events is vital in adapting society to the effects of climate change [ 2]. Recently, data-driven machine learning models have shown impressive weather forecasting performance, matching or even outperforming existing NWP systems [ 3–5]. These Neural Weather Prediction (NeurWP) models produce forecasts in a fraction of the time of traditional NWP, opening up many new possibilities. One successful family of NeurWP models, that we focus on in this work, utilize Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to produce forecasts [ 6,5]. As these models are trained on NWP data, with built-in physics assumptions, they represent a useful blend of existing knowledge and new possibilities introduced by machine learning. While most existing work in NeurWP has been focused on global weather forecasting, it is of substantial interest how these methods can be utilized also for Limited Area Models (LAMs). Such local models are used by many institutes to create high resolution forecasts for specific regions of interest [ 7–14]. In this paper we adapt graph-based NeurWP to the limited area setting, and also introduce a hierarchical model extension.1The graph-based framework is an attractive choice for LAMs due to the freedom in designing the associated graphs. By choosing these graphs appropriately, a general model formulation can be applied to regions of different shape or alignment with global coordinate systems. We evaluate our graph-based models on a dataset from the MetCoOp Ensemble Prediction System (MEPS) LAM [7]. Climate Impact Due to climate change, access to efficient and accurate weather modeling is increasingly important. Fast NeurWP LAMs contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation 1Our code is available at https://github.com/joeloskarsson/neural-lam.

Detecting extreme events requires modeling the full distribution of weather states, which is typically done by creating an ensemble of forecasts from perturbed versions of initial states [15]. 2) Providing accurate forecasts for renewable energy production, enabling better integration of these volatile sources into existing energy systems. 3) Reducing the energy required to produce fine-grained weather forecasts [ 16]. In appendix A we discuss paths to climate impact in more detail. 2 Related Work Global NeurWP Our work builds on graph-based NeurWP [ 6] and in particular the GraphCast model [ 5]. Apart from this approach, another family of global NeurWP models rely on transformer architectures [ 17,18], treating spatial or spatio-temporal patches of the weather state as input tokens [4,19,16,20,21]. Some of these transformer-based approaches have been framed as foundation models, aiming to learn general representations of the atmosphere that can be utilized in diverse downstream tasks [ 20,21]. Such models can be fine-tuned for limited area forecasting, but using the same variables as the global models and an area aligned with the global latitude-longitude grid. Other noteworthy models are based on neural operator architectures [ 22,23], which perform efficient global convolutions by operating in the frequency domain [16, 24]. Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks Our proposed hierarchical GNN structure shares many ideas with the models of Fortunato et al. [25] andLino et al. [26]. While also motivated by capturing multiple spatial scales, they apply hierarchical GNNs to general Partial Differential Equation (PDE) solving, rather than the weather forecasting task. 3 Graph-based Forecasting for a Limited Area The vast majority of NeurWP models learn to approximate a function Xt=f\u0000 Xt−1,..., Xt−p\u0001 that autoregressively maps from the plast weather states to the state Xtat time step t[4,6,16].
