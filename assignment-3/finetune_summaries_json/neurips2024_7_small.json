Sea ice concentration is one of the key indicators of climate change and is also critical for a number of different applications and indigenous peoples. Consequently, there is an acute need to develop a baseline of a diverse set of modern machine learning techniques within the Arctic. Our work aims to fill this gap, with the goal of both informing current research, as well as pointing out limitations with certain architectures. We achieve this by providing baselines for a number of different convolutional LSTMs, transformer based, and neural operator based machine learning methods. 1 Introduction While popular imagination might view the Arctic as a cold and barren region, it is home to a complex and important ecosystem [ 1]. Unfortunately, in recent years the Arctic has experienced a rapid warming due to climate change resulting in unprecedented changes to the sea-ice dynamics [ 1,2]. Many remote and native Arctic communities depend upon the ice for transportation, hunting, and general way of life. These communities have developed inter-generational knowledge of sea-ice patterns to thrive in the Arctic climate [ 3,4]. However, the changing climate and ice conditions have started to threaten their way of life by making the use of the ice more dangerous [ 4]. For these reasons short term high resolution ice forecasts are not only critical for day-to-day operations and weather forecasting [5, 6], but for these remote communities as well [7]. Despite the significance of this problem, there is a lack of works focusing on providing strong baselines for different model architectures for sea-ice forecasting. Many sea-ice forecasting works elect to focused on either a singular or small subset of architectures. This is alongside the fact that many works focus on different regions within the Arctic, at different data resolutions, and for different forecast horizons. These differences make comparing results between works incredibly difficult, hence the motivation for a baseline of architectures all evaluated under the same conditions. Besides Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Polar-centric view (left) shows our selected forecast coordinates highlighted with a red rectangle. The domain-centric view (right) displays a sea-ice concentration sample. providing for a good starting point for performance evaluation, baselines can also help uncover patterns of success and limitations between architectures inspiring future research. 2 Dataset The data source uses the GLORYS12V1 product [ 8] and is largely based on the CMEMS system. This study used twenty years of daily historical sea ice concentration data within the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic (see 1). We focus on the freeze up period of September to December. We use the years 2000 to 2016 for training, 2017 to 2018 for validation, and 2019 to 2020 for testing, which was selected based upon the most recent ice concentration values in the data product. The data spatial resolution is 0.083◦×0.083◦and we manually selected a region between Latitude 70.00 and 80.66 and Longitudes -144.00 and -133.33 which results in images of size 128×128for the models to ingest. 3 Methodology 3.1 Problem Setting The goal of this task is to produce short range high resolution sea ice forecasts, ingesting five days of ice concentration to predict the following fourteen days, selected based upon existing literature [ 5,6]. We could formally define this as f:X→Ywhere X∈R1×5×128×128andY∈R1×14×128×128 for our 1 variable (sea ice concentration) and 128×128spatial grid. 3.2 Previous Works Past works have focused on linear models [ 9,10] to predict sea-ice concentration. While intuitive, restricting models to a linear relationship can be too restrictive for the complex dynamics of sea-ice. Other works have focused on using convolutional neural networks, alone and in a U-Net structure, to capture spatial dynanmics [ 11,12,13,14]. To model temporal dynamics, convolutional (Conv) LSTMs [15] have been applied to great effect [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]. In recent years, transformers have been gaining popularity for a number of tasks [ 21,22,23] including time series forecasting [ 24,25]. Despite this, criticism has been raised as to the efficiency and effectiveness of transformers for time series applications [ 26,27]. Existing works have applied transformers to forecast sea-ice extent (total area of sea ice in a region) [ 28], however this does not produce the ice-charts that are critical to our applications. Other works have applied transformers in a spatial-temporal nature, however these either predict ice presence rather than concentration [ 19], focus on a very small and specific\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

Unfortunately, the Arctic has experienced rapid warming due to climate change, resulting in unprecedented changes to sea-ice dynamics. Many remote and native Arctic communities rely on the ice for transportation, hunting, and their way of life.

However, the changing climate and ice conditions threaten their way of life by making the use of the ice more hazardous. For these reasons, short-term high-resolution ice forecasts are critical for day-to-day operations, weather forecasting, and the well-being of these remote communities.\n\nDespite the significance of this problem, there is a lack of works providing strong baselines for different model architectures for sea-ice forecasting. Many sea-ice forecasting works focus on a single or limited subset of architectures. This is compounded by the fact that many works focus on different regions within the Arctic, varying data resolutions, and forecast horizons. These differences make comparing results between works extremely challenging, motivating the need for a baseline of architectures evaluated under the same conditions.\n\nProviding a baseline of architectures can serve as a starting point for performance evaluation, help uncover patterns of success and limitations between architectures, and inspire future research.\n\n2 Dataset\n\nThe data source uses the GLORYS12V1 product and is based on the CMEMS system. This study utilizes twenty years of daily historical sea ice concentration data within the Beaufort Sea in the Canadian Arctic. We focus on the freeze-up period from September to December. The data is divided into three sets: training (2000-2016), validation (2017-2018), and testing (2019-2020), with the latter selected based on recent ice concentration values. The data has a spatial resolution of 0.083° × 0.083°, and we manually selected a region between Latitude 70.00 and 80.66 and Longitudes -144.00 and -133.33, resulting in images of size 128 × 128 for the models to ingest.\n\n3 Methodology\n\n3.1 Problem Setting\n\nThe goal of this task is to produce short-range high-resolution sea ice forecasts, ingesting five days of ice concentration to predict the following fourteen days, based on existing literature.
