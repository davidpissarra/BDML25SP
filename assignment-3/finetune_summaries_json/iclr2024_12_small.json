The scarcity of ground-based monitoring facil- ities and the dependency of air pollution modeling on comprehensive datasets, often inaccessible for numerous areas, complicate this issue. In this work, we in- troduce GeoFormer, a compact model that combines a vision transformer module with a highly efficient time-series transformer module to predict surface-level ni- trogen dioxide (NO 2) concentrations from Sentinel-5P satellite imagery. We train the proposed model to predict surface-level NO 2measurements using a dataset we constructed with Sentinel-5P images of ground-level monitoring stations, and their corresponding NO 2concentration readings. The proposed model attains high accuracy (MAE 5.65), demonstrating the efficacy of combining vision and time-series transformer architectures to harness satellite-derived data for enhanced GHG emission insights, proving instrumental in advancing climate change moni- toring and emission regulation efforts globally. 1 I NTRODUCTION The emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs), primarily from industrial and transportation activities, is a major contributor to the increasingly urgent climate change crisis. This article introduces inno- vative methodologies for forecasting the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO 2), a prevalent byproduct of fossil fuel combustion that poses significant risks to both human health and the environment. No- tably, NO 2is closely associated with other air contaminants, such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and is often released alongside CO 2, a leading greenhouse gas, rendering it an effective indicator for gauging CO 2emissions. The adverse effects of NO 2on human health, particularly on the cardio- vascular and respiratory systems, underscore the necessity of managing NO 2levels. The ability to accurately identify instances where safe exposure thresholds are exceeded, as well as to assess indi- vidual exposure levels, demands detailed insight into the spatial and temporal distribution of NO 2. This requirement serves as a key motivation for our research. The advent of high-resolution satellite imagery, such as that provided by the Sentinel-5P satellite, offers unprecedented opportunities for the monitoring of atmospheric pollutants. The TROPOMI device on the Sentinel-5P satellite enables detailed observation of NO 2emissions on a global scale Bodah et al. (2022). However, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing this vast amount of data to produce accurate and timely predictions of surface-level GHG concentrations. Although deep learning models have demonstrated potential for estimating GHG emissions with the use of satellite imagery, there is an increasing need for models that are both accurate and computationally efficient. In response to these challenges, this paper presents an innovative architecture based on both a vision transformer (ViT) and a time-series transformer, aimed at monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions using Sentinel-5P imagery. Being a fraction of the size of models proposed for similar tasks, this represents an advancement in the application of deep learning to environmental monitoring, es- tablishing a new standard for tracking GHG emissions in real-time and with high efficiency and low compute. In addition, it lays the groundwork for future efforts aimed at mitigating climate change. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 The following are the main contributions of this work: 1.A Dataset of Paired Sentinel-5P and NO 2Data: We introduce a comprehensive dataset that pairs high-resolution Sentinel-5P satellite imagery with corresponding surface-level NO 2concentration measurements. This dataset is characterized by its daily granularity over the course of 15 months. 2.A Compact and Efficient Spatio-temporal Transformer Model: We propose a novel transformer-based model that leverages the spatial and temporal dynamics of NO 2emis- sions; the result is a model that outperforms existing methods in terms of accuracy while being significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources required. 2 R ELATED WORK 2.1 T RANSFORMER MODELS The transformer architecture, introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), revolutionized sequence model- ing. The core mechanism here is self-attention, which allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data relative to each other. Mathematically, the self-attention mechanism can be described as: Attention (Q,K,V) =softmax\u0012QKT √dk\u0013 V (1) whereQ,K, andVrepresent the query, key, and value matrices, respectively, derived from the input, and dkis the dimensionality of the keys and queries, which serves as a scaling factor. This ability to handle sequences in their entirety parallelizes computation and has led to state-of-the-art results in various sequence modelling tasks (Devlin et al., 2019). However, as is noted by Zhou et al. (2021), the vanilla transformer architecture has O(N2)time complexity, where Nis the number of input tokens. 2.2 D EEPLEARNING FOR GREENHOUSE GASEMISSIONS\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
