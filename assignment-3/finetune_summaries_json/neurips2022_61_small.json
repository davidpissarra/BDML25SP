For instance, current state-of-the-art process-based agricul- ture models rely on high-resolution climate data during the growing season for accurate estimation of crop yields. However, high-resolution climate data for future climates is unavailable and needs to be simulated, and that too for multiple possible climate scenarios, which becomes prohibitively expensive via traditional methods. Meanwhile, deep generative models leveraging the expressivity of neural networks have shown immense promise in modeling distributions in high dimensions. Here, we cast the problem of simulation of climate scenarios in a generative modeling framework. Specifically, we leverage the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) framework for simulating synthetic climate scenarios. We condition the model by quantifying the degree of “extremeness\" of the observed sample, which allows us to sample from different parts of the distribution. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method on the CHIRPS precipitation dataset. 1 Introduction Noticeable shifts in climate patterns have been observed over the last few decades, including an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Such events often result in severe societal impacts, with risks to agriculture, access to water resources, energy management and transportation, among others [ 1]. Therefore, accurate modeling and prediction of climate patterns is of immense interest. For instance, process-based models, like crop growth or hydrological models, that are used to assess potential impacts on climate-sensitive sectors [ 2,3] generally require long time series of high-resolution weather data [2, 4]. Stochastic weather generators have been widely used to provide synthetic weather series that represent plausible climate scenarios to the impact models [5, 6, 2, 3]. The first stochastic weather generators date to the 1980s [ 7], and since then, several techniques have been explored with different levels of complexity [ 4]. However, traditional models often fail to generate extremes such as droughts or flooding [ 2]. Some weather generators can be conditioned on external variables, e.g. [ 2], which produces weather sequences consistent with temperature and precipitation seasonal forecasts. That is, the external variables control the generation of weather fields. The idea of controlling weather Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.field synthesis is essential for producing what-if scenarios to study its particular effects on sensitive areas. For example, local governments may need to investigate the risks of floods in a region subject to consecutive days of plausible heavy rainfall events. In recent years, machine learning based generative models have achieved notable success in modeling high dimensional complex distributions, which has led to their application in stochastic weather generation. For instance, Variational AutoEncoders (V AEs) [ 8] have been used to generate precipi- tation data and control synthesis by sampling from different regions of the latent space [ 9], while Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) [ 10] based approaches have been shown to generate realistic precipitation samples [ 11] and model weather extremes [ 12]. In this work, we make use of the GAN framework for stochastic weather modeling, focusing on conditional generation. Conditional GANs [13] have shown great success in several tasks involving an input controlling the data generation, such as image-to-image translation [ 14,15]. More recently, researchers have explored these models for weather generation [ 12,16]. In this paper, we leverage the conditional GAN framework to generate synthetic precipitation scenarios. For this, we propose a simple yet effective conditioning metric and empirically demonstrate that it allows to accurately model and sample from different quantiles of precipitation in the data distribution. 2 Methods and Experiments Data For our experiments, we use the Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Station data (CHIRPS) [ 17] rainfall data set. It consists of daily precipitation fields with a spatial resolution of 0.05 degrees, and spans from 1981–2021. For our experiments, we use a bounding box of 6.4 ×6.4 degrees, which equates to a resolution of 128 ×128 pixels, where each pixel represents a geographical region spanning a spatial resolution of 0.05 ×0.05 degrees. The chosen spatial region is bound by latitudes (18.0, 24.4) and longitudes (74, 80.4), a region in central India shown in Fig. 1a. Researchers are often more interested in capturing seasonal trends, for instance precipitation during the growing season. As such, we limit our focus to precipitation samples between June–October, which roughly corresponds to the monsoon (rainy) season in central India. Fig. 1b indeed verifies that most precipitation in the region occurs during the selected months (roughly between days numbered in the range 150–290). Additionally, we note that samples within this sub-interval successfully capture most of the variation in the total amount of rainfall, allowing us to sub-sample from the large amount samples without losing fidelity.
