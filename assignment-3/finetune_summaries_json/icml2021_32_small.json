We utilized natural language processing and bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT) based transfer learning to ﬁne-tune the model on the data from the news-based Drought Impact Report (DIR) and then apply it to recognize seven types of drought impacts based on the ﬁltered Twitter data from the United States. Our model achieved a satisfying macro-F1 score of 0.89 on the DIR test set. The model was then applied to California tweets and validated with keyword-based labels. The macro-F1 score was 0.58. However, due to the limitation of keywords, we also spot-checked tweets with controversial labels. 83.5% of BERT labels were correct compared to the keyword labels. Overall, the ﬁne-tuned BERT-based recognizer provided proper predictions and valuable information on drought impacts. The interpretation and analysis of the model were consistent with experiential domain expertise. 1 Introduction Drought is a major but normal natural hazard with complex and broad impacts on many sectors of society and the economy [ 1]. One signiﬁcant characteristic of drought is the difﬁculty of determining boundaries in space and time, in contrast to other disasters such as ﬂoods and wildﬁres [ 2]. Drought impacts range across wildlife and agriculture to public health and social stability. Climate change is impacting precipitation patterns on a large scale, which increases the frequency and intensity of extremes, including severe drought [ 3,4,5]. Drought vulnerability and impacts are also partly the result of human activity [ 6,7,8]. Improving insight into drought impacts can strengthen societal resilience to more severe droughts under a warming climate. Many studies have employed remote sensing, meteorological and hydrological variables, crop yield, and other biomass data to develop drought indices to monitor and evaluate drought intensity, frequency, spatial and temporal extent. Some of them tried to link drought indices to drought impacts on agriculture and the ecohydrological environment [ 9,10,11,12]. However, a primary challenge of similar studies is that the input data sets for calculating indices fall short of capturing the diversity of drought impacts in social and economic sectors such as water supply and small business. Therefore, most current drought indices would underestimate the severity and scope of drought impacts in the human dimension due to the limitation of data. A 2020 study suggests that social media could be a good source of informative data to provide the different types of drought impacts, which could reﬂect the sensory information from people’s observations and experiences in \u0003University of Nebraska-Lincoln, Lincoln, NE, United States yThomson Reuters Labs, Eagan, MN, United States zNational Drought Mitigation Center, Lincoln, NE, United States xUniversity of Nebraska-Kearney, Kearney, NE, United States Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at ICML 2021.a water-short area [ 13]. Twitter, as one of the largest international social media platforms, has been increasingly applied to study natural hazards. For instance, a classic study employed tweets as its only input data to detect earthquakes’ location in Japan based on probabilistic models [ 14]. Tweets were also used to extract the damages of disasters by applying various machine-learning methods, such as support vector machine, decision tree, and logistic regression [ 15]. Another study compared different neural networks built on top of various word embedding models of Tweets in Hindi on detecting situational information during various disasters [ 16]. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study has tried to apply social media data and advanced text-mining and natural language processing (NLP) techniques to identify and analyze drought impacts. This paper presents a deep-learning-based transfer learning framework to identify multi-category drought impacts from Twitter data in the United States. The Drought Impact Reporter (DIR) data with multi-labels was employed to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers (BERT). The ﬁne-tuned model was then applied to the ﬁltered tweets from 2017 to 2020 to identify drought impacts. To evaluate the model’s performance on tweets with transfer learning, we labeled a group of tweets in California based on the keywords related to the different types of drought impacts as a calibration data set. The exploratory results from the recognizer reveal potential for learning about various drought impacts and their relationships and trends from tweets, and that would help us be prepared for drought in the warming climate. 2 Data and Methods 2.1 Data We acquired 14,178 records of labeled DIR data from 2011 to 2020 in the United States from the National Drought Mitigation Center (NDMC) to ﬁne-tune the pre-trained BERT model. The DIR collects drought impacts primarily from news media. The drought impacts are manually classiﬁed into nine categories1by experts at the NDMC. Considering the relationships of the different classes, we aggregated energy, business &\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nDrought has significant impacts on various sectors of society and the economy. One of the challenges in determining drought impacts is the difficulty in defining boundaries in space and time, unlike other disasters such as floods and wildfires. Drought impacts can affect wildlife, agriculture, public health, and social stability. Climate change is altering precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and intense droughts. Human activities also contribute to drought vulnerability and impacts.\n\nImproving our understanding of drought impacts can enhance societal resilience to severe droughts under a warming climate. Previous studies have used remote sensing, meteorological, and hydrological variables, crop yield, and biomass data to develop drought indices. However, these studies often lack data on drought impacts in social and economic sectors, such as water supply and small businesses. As a result, current drought indices may underestimate the severity and scope of drought impacts in the human dimension.\n\nA 2020 study suggested that social media could be a valuable source of data to provide information on drought impacts. Twitter, as one of the largest social media platforms, has been used to study natural hazards. For instance, a study used tweets to detect earthquakes in Japan, while another study used tweets to extract damage information from disasters. However, no study has applied social media data and advanced text-mining and natural language processing techniques to identify and analyze drought impacts.\n\nThis paper presents a deep-learning-based transfer learning framework to identify multi-category drought impacts from Twitter data in the United States.
