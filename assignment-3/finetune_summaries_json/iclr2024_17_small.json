At the current stage, this is just a proof of concept, being at least able to identify basic meteorologically plausible facts from data. 1 I NTRODUCTION Current numerical weather and climate prediction models face challenges in effectively modeling cloud physics whose dynamics cover a large breadth of spatial and temporal scales. Achieving a comprehensive understanding of cloud physics is a signiﬁcant objective within theﬁeld of atmo- spheric modeling. In this paper, we describe work-in-progress towards a data-driven approach with the goal of supporting atmospheric physicists in understanding the relevant processes better. Our approach is rather simple and straightforward: We use ERA5-reanalysis data – i.e., a “gold standard” reconstruction of the past physical state of the atmosphere – and use a regressor based on a deep convolutional network (U-Net) trained to predict the visible channels of high-resolution satellite data (gray-scale images taken by NASA satellites in the visible spectrum over water, thus primarily depicting clouds) from physical state. This turns out to work surprisingly well, even exceeding the matching quality in terms of the normalized-cross-correlation (NCC) score by almost a factor of two over just taking the built-in ”cloud cover” channel of the same ERA5 dataset. Next, we use “masking” of input channels (optimizing for the minimum amount of input channels through an added sparsity prior) to identify the input most relevant for the predictions. This reveals which physical quantities are most predictive of the cloud structure. Someﬁndings (e.g., tempera- tures being disregarded in the tropics, but being important in mid latitudes) are not surprising, but show that in principle such an approach can uncover physical insights from observational data. 2 R ELATED WORK Machine learning has been applied to a wide range ofﬁelds in the physical sciences. Gentine et al. (2018) utilize machine learning techniques to improve the parameterization of convection in climate simulations at a coarse scale. Rolnick et al. (2019) provide a comprehensive overview of the current and potential applications of machine learning in addressing climate change. Toms et al. (2020) use layerwise relevance propagation (Bach et al., 2015) to prove that neural networks can identify the coherent spatial patterns of known modes of Earth system variability. As neural networks gain popularity, explanation methods are becoming increasingly relevant. Not only to increase conﬁdence in the prediction, but also to establish a clear connection between the input and output and to provide a physical interpretation. Most of them can be categorized as either gradient-based or non-local perturbation methods. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Generated subpatches between0◦and60◦Northern latitude with used regions highlighted Gradient-based methods like SmoothGrad (Smilkov et al., 2017), Integrated Gradients (Sundarara- jan et al., 2017) or GradCAM (Selvaraju et al., 2017) use some kind of back propagation of the output score with respect to the input to assign importance scores, while non-local perturbation methods like DeepLIFT (Shrikumar et al., 2019), SHAP (Lundberg & Lee, 2017) or LIME (Ribeiro et al., 2016) modify the input in a speciﬁc way. A subcategory of perturbation methods are masking approaches. A distinction can be made between removing (Fong & Vedaldi, 2017; Qi et al., 2020) or preserving evidence (Khorram et al., 2021). 3 M ETHOD 3.1 D ATA ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5):In our work, we try to predict cloud structures based on physi- cal conditions. Therefore, we use the ERA5 dataset (Hersbach et al., 2023) of global atmospheric reanalyses (i.e., a bestﬁt of an atmospheric simulation against most available observational data). It offers high-resolution data with a spatial resolution about30kilometers (0.25degrees in longitude and latitude) and hourly temporal resolution. For vertical resolution, we choose model levels, which resolve the atmosphere from the surface up to a height of approximately24kilometers. The ERA5 dataset covers a variety of physical quantities. We restrict ourselves to the most basic ones: temper- ature, speciﬁc humidity, cloud liquid and ice water content, horizontal wind and vertical velocity.
