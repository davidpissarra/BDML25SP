Achieving climate  goals can reinforce the achievements in many other goals, but  at the same time climate mitigation and adaptation measures  may generate trade-offs, such as levelling  the cost of energy  and transitioning away from fossil fuels. Leveraging the synergies and minimizing the trade-offs among the climate goals and other SDGs is an imperative task for ensuring policy coherence. Understanding the interlinkages between climate action and other SDGs can help inform about the synergies and trade-offs. This paper presents a novel  methodology by using natural language processing (NLP) to  automate the process of systematically identifying the key  interlinkages between climate action and SDGs from a large  amount of climate liter ature. A qualitative SDG interlinkages  model for climate action was automatically generated and  visualized in a network graph. This work contributes to the  conference thematic topic on using AI for policy alignment for climate change goals, SDGs and associated environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks.  Introduction   The UN 2030 Agenda charts out 17 interlinked Sustainable  Development Goals (SDGs) that require a holistic approach  to their implementation. However, such a holistic approach  is new and challenging due to the broad coverage of social,  economic and environmental dimensions and complicated  relations among 169 targets. This is particularly true for  SDG 13 (climate action) which links with all major sectors  including energy, industry, transport and agriculture, and  poses severe challenges to human and animal life, the  planet’s water, marine and terrestrial ecosystems and  biodiversity. Achieving climate goals can reinforce the  achievements in many other goals, but at the same time  climate actions may generate trade-offs, such as levelling  the cost of energy and transitioning away from fossil fuels.

Leveraging the synergies and minimizing the trade-offs  among climate goals and other SDGs is an imperative task  for ensuring policy coherence. Understanding the  interlinkages of climate action within the SDGs can help  inform about the synergies and trade-offs.  There is a gap in the scientific knowledge about how the  SDGs are interlinked, making it difficult to know whether  targets are mutually reinforcing or competing with one  another. This knowledge gap inhibits the adoption of an  integrated approach. There are emerging attempts to  understand SDG interlinkages (e.g., Allen, Metternicht, and  Wiedmann 2018; ICSU 2017; Le Blanc 2015; Miola,  Borchardt, and Neher 2019; Nilsson, Griggs, and Visback  2016; Zhou and Moinuddin 2017; Zhou, Moinuddin, and Li  2021). These attempts took different approaches, such as  expert opinion (e.g., ICSU 2017), literature review (e.g.,  Zhou et al. 2022) and statistical analysis (e.g., Dörg ő,  Sebestyén, and Abonyi 2018). Among these attempts, the  Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES)  developed the SDG Interlinkages Analysis & Visualisation  Tool (https://sdginterlinkages.iges.jp/) to identify, quantify  and visualise the SDG interlinkages (Zhou, Moinuddin, and  Li 2021). The IGES method uses a literature review to  identify the causal relations based on scientific evidence.   The tool covering 27 countries from Asia and Africa has  been used to assist policy making on SDG priority setting,  institutional arrangement and sectoral policy development  in countries such as Indonesia, Bangladesh and Viet Nam.  However, the lack of well-defined evidence on the  causations between SDG targets poses a major challenge for  the application of the IGES tool. The tool's current literature  review is conducted manually based on a limited amount of  literature, making it difficult to systematically capture the  full range of SDG interactions. For example, a keyword- based search on “climate change” in titles from Scopus      found more than 85,000 relevant references. Such a large  amoung of literature data makes a compelling case for a  systematic approach to literature review. A manual  approach is also laborious, potentially subjective based on  the judgement of different subject experts and difficult to  scale to\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
