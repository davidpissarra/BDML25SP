Remote sensing of avalanche deposits can be very useful to identify avalanche risk zones and time periods, which can in turn provide insights about the effects of climate change. In this work, we use Sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data on the French Alps for the exceptional winter of 2017-18, with the goal of automatically detecting avalanche deposits. We address our problem with an unsupervised learning technique. We treat an avalanche as a rare event, or an anomaly, and we learn a variational autoencoder, in order to isolate the anomaly. We then evaluate our method on labeled test data, using an independent in-situ avalanche inventory as ground truth. Our empirical results show that our unsupervised method obtains comparable performance to a recent supervised learning approach that trained a convolutional neural network on an artiﬁcially balanced version of the same SAR data set along with the corresponding ground- truth labels. Our unsupervised approach outperforms the standard CNN in terms of balanced accuracy (63% as compared to 55%). This is a signiﬁcant improvement, as it allows our method to be used in-situ by climate scientists, where the data is always very unbalanced (< 2% positives). This is the ﬁrst application of unsupervised deep learning to detect avalanche deposits. 1 Introduction Reliable inspection of avalanche debris is important to study the stability of the snowpack and variability of the avalanche activity, which can aid in avalanche forecasting.

For this work, we have used backscatter coefﬁcients at C-band from the Sentinel-1A and 1B satellites observing the French Alps every 6 days (active microwave imaging). Detection methods which isolate debris-like features by contrasting backscatter between a deposit and surrounding undisturbed snowpack have been used to detect avalanche deposits (Karbou et al. [2018b]). While recent work by Karbou et al. [2018b], Waldeland et al. [2018] demonstrates the potential of Sentinel-1 SAR data for avalanche detection, simple change detection methods (Karbou et al. [2018a]) fail to capture the complexity of the interaction between the radar signals and the snow. Few classiﬁcation-based machine learning techniques have been used to tackle the problem on SAR imagery, e.g., a random forest classiﬁer in Hamar et al. [2016], and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Waldeland et al. [2018], Sinha et al. [2019]. Both Hamar et al. [2016] and Waldeland et al. [2018] rely on expert labelling and the accuracy of the expert labelling has not been discussed. Unlike the previous supervised works, in this paper, we take an unsupervised learning approach to train our model, allowing our techniques to scale to large unbalanced SAR data sets. In order to evaluate our methods in comparison with related work, we use an avalanche event inventory as ground truth instead of an expert labelled data. This inventory is maintained by forest rangers from ONF (Ofﬁce National des Forêts) and stored by Irstea research institute. It includes more than 4000 avalanche events in the season 2017-2018 across more than 3000 mountain paths (corridors) in the French Alps. However, the avalanche deposits are only roughly localized. Avalanche are rare events. As such, there is a need for methods which are able to detect them in unbalanced datasets, in constrast to recently developed methods that use artiﬁcially balanced data (Sinha et al. [2019]). Unsupervised learning approaches have recently proven to be efﬁcient for very unbalanced data, i.e. for rare events (Kiran et al. [2018]). We propose training a Variational Autoencoder for this task.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe University of Grenoble Alpes in France, in collaboration with Cécile Coléou from CNRM-GAME and Météo-France, and Claire Monteleoni from the University of Colorado Boulder, USA, conducted a study on avalanche monitoring. The research focused on using remote sensing of avalanche deposits to identify risk zones and time periods, which can provide insights into the effects of climate change.\n\nThe study utilized Sentinel-1 SAR (synthetic aperture radar) data from the French Alps during the exceptional winter of 2017-18. The goal was to automatically detect avalanche deposits using an unsupervised learning technique. The researchers treated avalanches as rare events or anomalies and trained a variational autoencoder to isolate the anomaly.\n\nThe method was evaluated using labeled test data from an independent in-situ avalanche inventory, which served as ground truth. The results showed that the unsupervised method performed comparably to a recent supervised learning approach that trained a convolutional neural network on artificially balanced SAR data with corresponding ground-truth labels. However, the unsupervised approach outperformed the standard CNN in terms of balanced accuracy, achieving 63% compared to 55%. This improvement is significant, as it allows the method to be used in-situ by climate scientists, where the data is often unbalanced, with less than 2% positives.\n\nThis study is the first application of unsupervised deep learning to detect avalanche deposits. Reliable inspection of avalanche debris is crucial for studying the stability of the snowpack and variability of avalanche activity, which can aid in avalanche forecasting. This can not only improve human safety in mountainous regions under a changing climate but also provide insights on climate change.\n\nThe researchers used backscatter coefficients at C-band from the Sentinel-1A and 1B satellites, which observe the French Alps every 6 days.
