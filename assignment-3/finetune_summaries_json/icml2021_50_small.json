This will substantially improve our ability in predicting future Arctic sea ice changes, which is fundamen- tal for forecasting transporting routes, resource development, coastal erosion, threats to Arctic coastal communities and wildlife. 1. Introduction Over the last three decades, the warming of the sea ice in the Arctic has been almost twice faster than the rest of the world. This phenomenon is also called Arctic ampliﬁcation (Hol- land & Bitz, 2003).This ampliﬁcation will further alter the climate patterns beyond the Arctic region and lead to more intense and more frequent extreme weather events. A recent example of this is the 2021’s historic cold snap in Texas and Oklahoma, where more than 3000 daily low temperature records were broken, resulting in at least 176 fatalities and $195 billion economic loss (Freedman et al., 2021). The sea ice plays a key role in the Arctic climate system and it has been fallen by half since 1979 when the satellite observa- tions were available (Serreze & Stroeve, 2015).

Such rapid changes has profound local and global impacts on transporting routes, resource devel- opment, coastal erosion, military and civilian infrastructure, Arctic coastal communities (hunting and transportation by indigenous populations), wildlife (e.g., polar bear access to food sources). Though most of the scientists agree that this rapid Arctic warming is a sign of human-caused climate change, study- ing the causes of Arctic ampliﬁcation and forecasting sea ice has become one of the most hyped questions in the Earth Science research (Holland et al., 2019). Current operational sea ice forecasting systems are mainly based on coupled Earth System Models, which estimates the solution to dif- ferential equations of ﬂuid motion and thermodynamics to obtain time and space dependent values for various vari- ables in the atmosphere, ocean or sea ice. However, these physics-based models perform no better than simple sta- tistical methods at lead times of two months and beyond. Over the last few years, there are many studies focusing on sea ice forecasting using data-driven Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) approaches like machine learning and deep learning. Chi & Kim (2017) compared the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model with a traditional statistical model, and they found that the LSTM showed good performance for 1-month sea ice concentration (SIC) prediction, with less than 9% av- erage monthly errors. However, there is lower predictability during the melting season, with the root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) of 11.09% from July to September. Wang et al. (2017) showed the superiority of the convolutional neural networks (CNN) in SIC prediction with an estimated RMSE of 22% compared to a multi-layer preceptron model. Kim et al. (2019) applied deep neural networks with Bayesian model averaging ensemble to predict the SIC in the next 10 to 20 years and found out the annual RMSE of 19.4%. More recently, Kim et al. (2020) built a novel 1-month SIC prediction model with CNNs using eight predictors to pre- dict SIC both temporally and spatially. They showed that CNNs had better performance than a random forest model and the persistence model based on the monthly trend, with the RMSE of 5.76%. Liu et al. (2021) proposed a 1-day SIC prediction model based on the Convolutional LSTM and they concluded that the predictability of Convolutional LSTM always performed better than that of the CNN, withForecasting Sea Ice Concentrations using Attention-based Ensemble LSTM an RMSE of 11.24% through 10 consecutive days of itera- tive prediction. In light of above related work, we introduce a sea ice fore- casting system with Attention-based Ensemble Long Short- Term Memory (LSTM) networks to predict monthly sea ice extent with a lead time of 1 month. The major goal of this study is to work on deep learning based forecasting models that can utilize multi-temporal data to forecast daily, weekly and monthly sea-ice extent with comparatively high accuracy.
