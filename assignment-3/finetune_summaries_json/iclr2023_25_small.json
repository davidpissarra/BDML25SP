We use machine learning (ML) to investigate fu- ture patterns of sea level change. To understand the extent of contributions from the climate-change signals, and to help in forecasting sea level change in the fu- ture, we turn to climate model simulations. This work presents a machine learning framework that exploits both satellite observations and climate model simulations to generate sea level rise projections at a 2-degree resolution spatial grid, 30 years into the future. We train fully connected neural networks (FCNNs) to predict altimeter values through a non-linear fusion of the climate model hindcasts (for 1993-2019). The learned FCNNs are then applied to future climate model pro- jections to predict future sea level patterns. We propose segmenting our spatial dataset into meaningful clusters and show that clustering helps to improve predic- tions of our ML model. 1 I NTRODUCTION With melting ice sheets and the growing warmth of the ocean water, the global mean sea level is rising at an extraordinary rate and is accelerating (0.08mm/year2) [17]. While, on average, the sea level has risen 10 cm over the last 30 years, there is a considerable variation in the regional rates of the sea level change [11]. These regional patterns are richer in information and can be very useful in examining the impact of climate-driven factors including greenhouse gases, industrial aerosols, and biomass burning in the sea level change. Studies in [5; 6; 7] have found the regional variations to be linked to aerosols and greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying how regional trends will evolve in the future is also beneficial for socioeconomic planning. Our work investigates the sea level at a 2-degree or 180 x 90 (longitude x latitude) spatial resolution. Now that there are almost three decades of satellite altimeter records or observations1, we want to explore the rising rate of the sea level further and investigate how much of this rise can be attributed to climate-change signals. To do this, we turn to the climate models in order to provide a better understanding of the altimeter data and to help in forecasting future sea level change by learning more about the extent of the causal contributions from such factors. A climate model uses math- ematical equations to simulate complex physical and chemical processes of Earth systems such as the atmosphere, land, ocean, ice, and solar energy [8]. A recent study by Fasullo and Nerem (2018) with two climate model large ensembles showed that the forced responses of greenhouse gas and ˚Corresponding author: Saumya Sinha, saumya.sinha@colorado.edu 1We obtain our altimeter data for the period 1993-2019 from https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/ en/data/products/ocean-indicators-products/mean-sea-level.html 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 aerosols have begun to emerge in the altimeter data patterns. This motivates us to include climate models in designing our machine learning (ML) pipeline. Our goal is to generate sea level projections 30 years into the future and at a 2-degree spatial res- olution utilizing the altimeter data as well as climate model simulations. Some past works have used satellite altimeter data and adopted ML techniques to perform sea level prediction. While tide-gauge data has also been used for similar tasks, satellite altimetry provides nearly global cover- age. Braakmann-Folgmann et al. (2017) used a combination of CNN + ConvLSTM layers to perform interannual sea level anomalies (SLA) prediction over the Pacific Ocean. [20] work with LSTM for South China Sea. In [1], the authors include ocean-atmospheric features like sea surface tempera- ture, salinity, surface atmospheric pressure to build support vector and LSTM models for the West Peninsular Malaysia coastline. [18] make use of gaussian processes and LSTM to predict sea level variation along the regional coastal zones. In [12], they compare various machine learning tech- niques to predict global mean sea level rise. However, none of these models go so far as to forecast sea level change 30years in advance. They also do not produce forecasts for the entire globe. Our work addresses the problem at a much bigger spatial scale that includes all the oceans and a much longer time horizon in the future. Our framework utilizes climate models to understand the causal effects of climate-change signals. We add interpretability to our model by explaining the contribu- tions of the climate model ensembles.
