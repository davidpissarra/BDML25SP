Coupled climate models used for decadal predictions are, however, im- perfect representations of the climate system causing forecast biases. Biases can also result from a poor model initialization that, when combined with forecast drift, can produce errors depending non-linearly on lead time. We propose a deep learning-based bias correction approach for post-processing gridded forecasts to enhance the accuracy of decadal climate predictions. 1 Motivation and problem statement Decadal or near-term climate prediction refers to climate forecasts on the range of a year to a decade. Unlike climate projections, which simulate the climate response to external forcing such as changes in greenhouse gas concentrations and aerosols, decadal predictions also simulate the climate response to unforced variations such as El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and other modes of internal climate variability. As part of the Wold Climate Research Program (WCRP), the Decadal Climate Prediction Project (DCPP) [1] offers quasi-real-time decadal forecasts for potential users, whereas the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Global Annual to Decadal Climate Update (GADCU) is produced annually to inform society on the state of the climate for the next 5 years [2]. Decadal forecasts typically drift from their observation-based initial conditions toward the uncon- strained model climatology, which may be far from observations. Consequently, operational decadal predictions often require some form of data post-processing to attain skill. This is often done using simple linear methods. Given the importance of climate predictions for informed adaptation strategies, the exploration of novel post-processing methods to correct forecast bias and drift is an important step to improve adaptation. We propose a deep learning model as a data post-processing tool for gridded climate predictions to enhance forecast skill. 2 Background and previous work While many studies describe adjustments of weather and subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) forecasts, there is limited work devoted to adjustments of decadal predictions, partly due to their relatively recent use, unique long-time range, drifts, and potential for erroneous trends. A simple approach is climatological bias correction, for which the difference between the modeled and observed clima- Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.(a)  (b) Figure 1: Annual averaged a) raw and b) trend corrected ensemble mean decadal forecasts (colored dots) of global mean surface temperature initialized from 1961 to 2015 obtained with CanESM5.

The initial conditions are warmer than observed, leading to raw forecasts that have significant initial biases, and drift towards the unconstrained historical simulations. These biases are improved with climatological and linear trend correction, but all errors cannot be resolved with these simple methods.
