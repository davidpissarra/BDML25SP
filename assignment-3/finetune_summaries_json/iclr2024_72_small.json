However, the inherent variability of renew- able energy, without effective storage solutions, often leads to imbalances between energy supply and demand. Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) emerges as a promising long-term storage solution to bridge this gap, yet its widespread imple- mentation is impeded by the high computational costs associated with high fidelity UHS simulations. This paper introduces UHS from a data-driven perspective and outlines a roadmap for integrating machine learning into UHS, thereby facilitating the large-scale deployment of UHS. 1 I NTRODUCTION Renewable energy, a key player in combating climate change, is gaining increasing global adoption Energy 2020 (2010); United nations (2015). In 2022, renewables contributed 13.1 %to the US’s primary energy consumption U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (2022) and 21.5 %to its utility-scale electricity generation. Furthermore, by 2024, countries like Spain, Germany, and Ire- land are expected to generate over 40 %of their annual electricity from wind and solar photovoltaics U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) (2023). Despite these strides, renewable energy sources face challenges due to unpredictable variations in atmospheric conditions and geographic limitations, leading to fluctuations in energy supply. Underground hydrogen (H 2) storage (UHS) is emerging as a vital technology for mitigating the intermittency of renewable energy sources Zivar et al. (2021); Tarkowski & Uliasz-Misiak (2022). When there’s a surplus in renewable energy production, excess electricity is converted into H 2and stored in geological formations. During times of high demand or low renewable energy generation, the stored H 2is then retrieved and utilized to meet energy needs. UHS, unlike batteries typically used for short-term storage Raad et al. (2022), is capable of storing significant amounts of energy over longer periods. This capability is crucial for counteracting seasonal energy fluctuations and maintaining a consistent energy supply year-round. UHS shares similarities with other subsurface applications such as hydrocarbon development Christie & Blunt (2001) and geological carbon sequestration (GCS) Moridis et al. (2023); Wen et al. (2023). However, it is distinguished by more complex operational conditions. In hydrocarbon development, the process is typically focused on extraction, while GCS is solely about injection. In contrast, UHS operates on a cyclic basis, incorporating both injection and extraction stages. This complexity in operational conditions introduces greater uncertainty in H 2storage performance. Tra- ditionally, the prediction of UHS performance relies on high-fidelity physics-based reservoir simu- lations Lysyy et al. (2021); Feldmann et al. (2016); Hogeweg et al. (2022); Okoroafor et al. (2023). These simulations accurately predict the H 2movement and pressure changes in geological forma- tions during UHS operations. However, they are extremely computationally intensive, thus delaying the pace of large-scale UHS deployment. To accelerate UHS prediction, turning to surrogate mod- eling via machine learning (ML) offers a promising strategy. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Figure 1: Temporal evolution of the spatial distribution of H 2saturation and reservoir pressure in a 2D UHS simulation. H 2is injected and withdrawn from a central well in a depleted gas reservoir over ten annual cycles comprising a 6-month injection stage followed by a 6-month withdrawal stage. The initial two subfigures (top row) depict the heterogeneous porosity and permeability of the geological formation. Subsequent figures show the H 2saturation and pressure distributions at various time points during UHS operations. ‘Early’ of a stage refers to two months after its onset, and ‘end’ of a stage to six months. Porosity is dimensionless; permeability is in millidarcys ( 10−15m2); H2saturation is dimensionless; pressure is in bars ( 105Pa). Currently, there is a knowledge gap in the literature when it comes to developing ML surrogate models for UHS–with only two articles on the subject up to our knowledge Mao et al. (2024); Chen et al. (2024). This gap is attributed not only to the fact that UHS is an emerging field but also to the inherent complexity of UHS operational conditions. It is important to note that the knowledge and techniques used in surrogate modeling for GCS do not directly apply to UHS due to its distinct and intricate operational dynamics. In this study, we outline the unique challenges of applying ML to UHS and propose ideas for developing accurate and efficient UHS ML models, supporting risk assessment and storage optimization of future UHS operations. 2 D ATA GENERATION UHS simulations are conducted by solving partial differential\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
