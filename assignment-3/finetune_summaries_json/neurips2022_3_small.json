We explore the performance of prior works on the new benchmark dataset, and present results after fine-tuning models using a similar approach as recent works. Furthermore, we train models of newer architectures and provide benchmark baselines to our datasets in several scenarios. We believe the release of these datasets may improve future research in both local and global geospatial domains for identifying and mapping of solar panel arrays from aerial imagery. The data is accessible at https://osf.io/aj539/. 1 Introduction The transition towards a more sustainable power generation has already begun. A core component of the energy mix in the future could very likely be solar panels also known as photovoltaics (PV) [ 15]. However, as the amount of deployed residential PV increases, the difficulty to balance the frequency of power for the Transmission System Operators (TSOs) becomes a harder task, as a greater part of the energy mix will be fluctuating due to meteorological variation caused by solar and wind. The ability to track solar adoption using remote sensing may benefit policy makers in their efforts to incentivize further green energy adoption, as identifying regions of lower solar adoption may be assisted using machine learning methods. Finally, there could be a viable motivation to understand the adoption of residential solar power, both in the sense of demographics studies as well as supporting greater adoption through hubs of installed PV—while some countries have good data and registration of residential installed PV, we often find it sparse, de-centralized and not easily accessible. Our contribution represents datasets spanning Denmark. We believe this dataset may contribute towards better models and generalization for the detection and localization of solar, and is as such a step in the right direction of the aforementioned goals. 2 Related works The early studies using machine learning for classification and localization of solar panels were commenced by [ 1,9,14], who demonstrated a viable approach to identify and localize residential PV ∗Equal contribution Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Table 1: An overview over the presented datasets in this paper ( †denotes that Gentofte Municipality is used for training and validation, and ⋆denotes that Herlev Municipality is used as the test set).

While showing promise, subsequent studies found challenges upon deployment when performing inference across geographical domains [ 5]. The causes are considered to be a function of the image modality variability: ground sampling distance (GSD), angle of sampled image, time of day, or atmospheric based diffusion. This challenge begs the question of garnering labelled data from a variety of geographical locations in order to learn a better generalizable model. We identified three comparable datasets released in previous years: A segmentation dataset from the US [1], as well as two classification and segmentation datasets based in Germany [ 10] and France [ 7]. The US dataset spans four cities and consists of 19,863 polygons bounding the PV systems on residential houses. The German dataset consists of 107,809 images for classification and 4028 images for segmentation, while the more recent French based crowdsourced dataset [ 7], contains 28,000 instances of PV systems with metadata including azimuth, surface, and slope, in addition around 20,000 annotated solar segmentations. 3 Dataset specification In this paper, we present two types of datasets. Similarly to prior works of Mayer et al. [10], we provide a classification and a segmentation dataset. For the problem of classification, we provide manually labelled image instances from two urban municipalities in the Greater Copenhagen Region, while also providing an exogenous image dataset gathered from the Danish Building Registry (BBR), including images that span all over Denmark where a PV system is to be registered. The segmentation dataset covers the same instances manually labelled in the classification set. The images were manually labelled using Pigeon [ 4], while for the segmentation, we relied on AI-assisted annotation software by Toronto Annotation Suite [ 6]. We refer to Table 1 for additional details and the Appendix for further examples and specifications of our labelling approach. SolarDK comprises images from GeoDanmark [ 3] with a variable Ground Sample Distance (GSD) between 10 cm and15 cm, all sampled between March 1\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
