Introduction Many problems in the environmental domain can be tack- led with data-driven approaches. However, as with any data-driven problem, the lack of available data limits the development and applicability of environmental modeling efforts. Furthermore, environmental modeling, speciﬁcally probability-based environmental modeling, in contrast with its dependency on data, suffers from data scarcity (Sit et al., 2020). The data scarcity problem in the ﬁeld is being iter- ated in many studies (Ebert-Uphoff et al., 2017; Rolnick et al., 2019) while the cardinality of publicly available pre- processed datasets remains to be low. 1.1.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICML 2021runoff prediction tasks, provides a go-to mark for practi- tioners working on ﬂood forecasting for contagious United States (Newman et al., 2015). CAMELS provides stream- ﬂow measurements from the nation-wide United States Ge- ological Survey (USGS) river sensor network as well as essential data points that are typically used in rainfall-runoff modeling. Although CAMELS is not prepared with sta- tistical predictive modeling in mind to support physical modeling, another study, FlowDB (Godfried et al., 2020) presents two extensive datasets with a machine learning focus. The ﬁrst dataset, following in CAMEL’s footsteps, focuses on streamﬂow levels along with precipitation mea- surements for ﬂood forecasting purposes. FlowDB also goes beyond streamﬂow with the second dataset on ﬂash ﬂood events. The second dataset includes many aspects of historic ﬂood events, including river ﬂow, precipitation measurements, property damage estimations, injury data, and event locations. While both CAMELS and FlowDB involve precipitation measurements, their main focus falls into the ﬂood forecasting domain rather than pure rainfall and precipitation context. One benchmark dataset focusing on rainfall is Weather- Bench (Rasp et al., 2020) which presents a dataset with a focus on medium-range weather forecasting pre-processed for deep learning applications. WeatherBench uses mea- surements from ERA5 numerical reanalysis dataset (Hers- bach et al., 2020). ERA5 combines a forecast model with the available observations and provides estimations of the atmospheric state. An alternative dataset using ERA5 is RainBench (de Witt et al., 2020). In addition to numeri- cal estimations from ERA5, RainBench also incorporates simulated satellite data as imagery and global precipitation estimates from IMERG(Huffman et al., 2015) to support easier data-driven weather forecasting. Even though the number of datasets published directly or re- motely related to precipitation has been gaining momentum for the last few years, the need for alternative environmental monitoring datasets in order to ensure better climate change modeling and planning is critical (Rolnick et al., 2019; Sit et al., 2020). This study presents a rain event dataset con- sisting of precipitation data between 2016 and 2019 from the state of Iowa based on the NEXRAD radar networkIowaRain: A Statewide Rain Event Dataset Based on Weather Radars and Quantitative Precipitation Estimation from seven radars positioned in and around the state. The main goal of this dataset is to support climate change mod- eling for effective disaster planning, response, and recovery. While the dataset presented here does not necessarily deﬁne a problem, it invites machine learning researchers to better study precipitation and rainfall by providing the dataset and various sample problems. This paper is structured as follows; the introduction sec- tion brieﬂy presents the problem that this paper tackles and covers previous works. The following section (Dataset) dis- cusses the speciﬁcs of the dataset by describing how the raw data was acquired and processed. Then it shares descriptive statistics representing the dataset to form an understand- ing while listing potential environmental domain problems for that the dataset can be used.

Introduction\nMany environmental problems can be addressed with data-driven approaches. However, the lack of available data limits the development and applicability of environmental modeling efforts. Environmental modeling, particularly probability-based environmental modeling, suffers from data scarcity, despite its dependency on data (Sit et al., 2020). The data scarcity problem in this field is a recurring issue in many studies (Ebert-Uphoff et al., 2017; Rolnick et al., 2019), and the number of publicly available pre-processed datasets remains low.\n\n1.1. Related Work\nStudies address data scarcity one step at a time. CAMELS is a widely used dataset for rainfall-runoff prediction tasks, serving as a benchmark for practitioners working on flood forecasting in the contiguous United States (Newman et al., 2015). CAMELS provides stream-flow measurements from the USGS river sensor network and essential data points used in rainfall-runoff modeling. Although CAMELS is not designed for statistical predictive modeling, another study, FlowDB (Godfried et al., 2020), presents two extensive datasets with a machine learning focus. The first dataset focuses on stream-flow levels and precipitation measurements for flood forecasting purposes, while the second dataset includes aspects of historic flood events, such as river flow, precipitation measurements, property damage estimations, injury data, and event locations.\n\nOther datasets, such as WeatherBench (Rasp et al., 2020) and RainBench (de Witt et al., 2020), focus on rainfall and precipitation, but their primary focus is on flood forecasting rather than pure rainfall and precipitation context. WeatherBench uses measurements from the ERA5 numerical reanalysis dataset (Hersbach et al., 2020), while RainBench incorporates ERA5 numerical estimations and simulated satellite data, as well as global precipitation estimates from IMERG (Huffman et al., 2015).\n\nDespite the increasing number of datasets related to precipitation, there is a need for alternative environmental monitoring datasets to support better climate change modeling and planning (Rolnick et al., 2019; Sit et al., 2020). This study presents a rain event dataset consisting of precipitation data from 2016 to 2019 from the state of Iowa, based on the NEXRAD radar network. The main goal of this dataset is to support climate change modeling for effective disaster planning, response, and recovery.\n\nThe dataset, called IowaRain, is based on data from seven radars positioned in and around the state. This paper is structured as follows: the introduction section presents the problem and covers previous works. The dataset section discusses the specifics of the dataset, including how the raw data was acquired and processed, and shares descriptive statistics representing the dataset. The conclusion section shares final remarks.\n\nFigure 1: A 2D rain rate map visualized for the Iowa domain.\nFigure 2: WSR-88D network radar coverages over the Iowa domain.\n\n2.
