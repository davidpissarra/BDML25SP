Recent studies (Nummi et al., 2018) have in- dicated that building dams increase the water levels in the area and as a result, reduces the carbon levels by absorbing carbon directly from soil and carbon dioxide from the air. This carbon is further dissolved in the soil to be later used by plants or is transferred downstream. To estimate the impact on climate, it is, therefore, necessary to ﬁrst identify the changes in the terrain around beavers’ habitat caused by beaver actions. Hence, the main aim of this research is to analyse the performance of pre-existing deep learning mod- els to perform classiﬁcation and recognition of local textural patterns like shrubs, beaver lodges and dams, vegetation, trees, etc within terrain images. Legacy computer vision methods like colour histogram and estimating the colour frequency and other feature map ex- traction models like Random Forests (RF) (Breiman, 2001) and Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001) etc were used previously however such algorithms are mostly ineffective as terrain images are susceptible to climatic and locality-based changes. Furthermore, colour characteristics within the same class make them indistin- guishable from each other, sometimes, even for a human eye. Semantic segmentation assigns each pixel in an image a speciﬁc class label, which is the core requirement of our classiﬁcation problem. Semantic segmentation divides the data in the domain into smaller units like superpixels, super voxels, grid-based units, etc. Object detection, in contrast, uses a template matching algorithm and creates a bound- ing box over units based on the correlation between the matching template and the pixel data. Such a bounding box never tightly ﬁts the detected classes and hence not usable on terrain patterns captured by aerial drone imagery, where the size of such objects is extremely small. Deep neural networks outperform any other frameworks used in com- puter vision for solving problems in domains like pattern recognition, feature extraction, and detection/classiﬁcation. Because of the complexity of the patterns in terrain, current classiﬁcation problem requires proper extraction of features from images for classiﬁcation. One of the most important challenges thus, using such models, is the lack of datasets to train deep models.

However, such models require significant training data. Pre-existing terrain datasets, such as CityScapes, PASCAL, and UA-VID, are mostly concentrated on urban areas and include roads, pathways, and buildings. These datasets are unsuitable for forest terrain analysis.
