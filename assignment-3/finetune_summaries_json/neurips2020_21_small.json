The tree species labels are generated from manually delineated maps for ﬁve land cover classes: Conifer, Hardwood, Shrub, ReforestedTree, and Barren land. With an accuracy of 92% on the test split, the model is applied to three wildﬁres on data from 2009 to 2018. The model accurately delineates areas damaged by wildﬁres, changes in tree species, and regrowth in burned areas. The result shows clear evidence of wildﬁres impacting the local ecosystem and the outlined approach can help monitor reforested areas, observe changes in forest composition, and track wildﬁre impact on tree species. 1 Introduction In the last decades, the frequency, intensity, and damage caused by wildﬁres are increasing in the Paciﬁc Northwest [ 1]. While wildﬁres can cause tremendous economic and social losses, one of their prolonged consequences is the resulting change of the vegetation species [ 2,3,4]. With climate change, the temperature and soil moisture create unfavorable conditions for vegetation regrowth in areas that were devastated by wildﬁres. The higher temperatures and lesser soil moisture impact the germination of seeds in locations where in the past they could strive. For example, multiple studies [5,6] have shown that rose pines and blue oaks may not regenerate in their traditional locations. Climate change may affect the variety and density of trees in areas affected by wildﬁres, and thus it is important to systematically monitor the long-term tree species distributions in ﬁre-prone regions. Classiﬁcation of tree species is often carried out by forest agencies based on visual inspection of aerial imagery [ 7]. These kinds of vegetation identiﬁcation campaigns are sparse in time with irregular updates, which may not be sufﬁcient to register the changes in vegetation caused by wildﬁres happening almost yearly. Here we propose a deep learning-based classiﬁcation method to monitor the impact of wildﬁres on tree species. Large-scale image classiﬁcation on multispectral images to detect tree species before and after wildﬁres can quantify the impact of wildﬁres on vegetation species. We apply the method to three historical wildﬁre regions in California and the results show clear changes in vegetation. With high-resolution images readily available from aerial or satellite observations, tracking tree species across large areas over an extended period of time is possible. Monitoring vegetation in near real-time can be used by forest services and environmental agencies to better plan for forest management after natural disaster events and quantify ecological disasters. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 20202 Related Work The impact of climate change on vegetation shift in North West USA has been studied since the 1990s [6,8]. Droughts, wildﬁres, and pests inﬂicted a noticeable impact on tree health in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, California [ 9]. To quantify the impact of wildﬁres on tree regeneration, ﬁeld surveys [2,10,11] are often conducted but limited to only a few sample sites. Haffey et al. [12] concluded from ﬁeld data that less than 5% of the wildﬁre affected area was regenerated with trees while the rest was covered by grass and shrubs. Hansen et al. [13] planted small plots of trees to study the survival of trees under increased ambient temperature and soil moisture and validated that climate change will rearrange certain tree species habitat. However, the controlled planting studies [ 13,14] are labor-intensive and rely on continuous supervision on the plots, which restricts the scale of such studies. Quick classiﬁcation of trees from aerial and satellite imagery can enable large-scale survey of tree species and track climate impact on their survival in their traditional habitats. Convolutional neural networks have been used to identify forests/trees in satellite snapshots [ 15,16,17], dense time series of imagery [ 18], and hyperspectral imagery [ 19]. Tracking tree species before and after wildﬁres was not pursued in any of the above studies. Additionally Lidar point clouds are classiﬁed to recognize tree species [ 20] or a combination of hyperspectral data and Lidar [ 21], but access to high-resolution Lidar scans is not readily available for most of the locations on the globe. 3 Datasets and Method Datasets.
