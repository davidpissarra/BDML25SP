Reser- voir simulation is widely used in GCS applications to predict subsurface pressure and CO 2saturation. High ﬁdelity numerical models are prohibitively expensive for data assimilation and uncertainty quantiﬁcation, which require a large number of simulation runs. Deep learning-based surrogate models have shown a great promise to alleviate the high computational cost. However, the training cost is high as thou- sands of high-ﬁdelity simulations are often necessary for generating the training data. In this work, we explore the use of a transfer learning approach to reduce the training cost. Compared with the surrogate model trained with high-ﬁdelity simulations, our new transfer learning-based model shows comparable accuracy but reduces the training cost by 80%. 1 Introduction We can prevent 90% of industry emissions from reaching the atmosphere by capturing the CO 2at source and then permanently store them underground. The storage process is known as geologic carbon storage (GCS). Reservoir simulation is widely used in GCS reservoir management to predict subsurface pressure and CO 2saturation. However, when used in the context of data assimilation and uncertainty quantiﬁcation, high-ﬁdelity numerical models are prohibitively expensive due to the large number of simulations required. Deep-learning-based surrogate models are emerging as an effective and efﬁcient alternative to conventional reservoir simulators for GCS applications ( Mo et al. [2019], Tang et al. [2021a], Tang et al. [2021b], Wen et al. [2021]). To train a neural network that predicts reservoir responses on a grid consisting of \u0018100,000 cells, thousands of reservoir simulations are usually required, incurring a high training cost. In this work, we explore the possibility of reducing the training cost by using multi-ﬁdelity data for the training. In other words, we ﬁrst use an ensemble of low-ﬁdelity simulations to train the network. The low-ﬁdelity ensemble embodies the same physics as the high-ﬁdelity models but adopts a lower grid resolution to reduce the per-simulation computational cost by an order of magnitude.

Note that “high/low ﬁdelity” in this work is used interchangeably with “high/low resolution”. Such a transfer learning-based approach has been recently applied to subsurface surrogate model development such as in [Song and Tartakovsky, 2021] for a 2D Gaussian case. The challenges posed by our target application include the complexity of 3D two-facies geological modeling and simulation, and the complex well control for CO 2injection. In this work, we apply transfer learning on 3D recurrent R-U-Net, developed by Tang et al. [2021c], to train a surrogate model for pressure prediction of a 3D GCS case with bimodal distribution. 2 Surrogate Model with Transfer Learning Forward Simulation. The GCS problem is simulated as a multi-phase ﬂow problem in porous media. Mass conservation for each phase and Darcy law are applied to solve the pressure and saturation. Finite volume formation is applied to solve the problem. In this work, we apply GEOSX (http://www.geosx.org/) to perform forward simulation. We provide the geological parameters (permeability, porosity, and etc.) and other modeling parameters (well controls). GEOSX is applied to generate pressure and CO 2saturation predictions. 3D Recurrent R-U-Net. In this work, we apply a 3D recurrent R-U-Net developed by Tang et al. [2021c] as surrogate model. 3D recurrent R-U-Net is composed of residual U-Net (R-U-Net) and convolutional long-short term memory network (3D convLSTM) as shown in Figure 1. The R-U-Net is applied to capture the spatial correlation between simulation input m(permeability, porosity, etc.) and simulation output y(pressure, saturation, etc.). 3D convLSTM is applied to capture the temporal correlation between simulation output in different time steps. The latent features from R-U-Net are the input for the convLSTM. The feature maps after convLSTM will feed into the decoding net to generate temporal predictions of reservoir response.
