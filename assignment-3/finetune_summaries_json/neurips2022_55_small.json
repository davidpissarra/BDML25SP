Reducing deforestation and forest degradation are considered to be one of the most effective approaches to reduce carbon emission and REDD+ is a framework to promote such efforts through the issuance of carbon credit. However, carbon credits from REDD+ have been subject to several criticisms. Credits issued for projects without actual positive effects on climate change mitigation are called “junk carbon credit”, and several studies have showed that many REDD+ projects may have produced junk carbon credits [ 2]. Criticisms to carbon credit are mainly about the validity of baseline, i.e., a counterfactual scenario in the absence of a project. Considering this issue, the concept of dynamic baseline has recently been discussed [ 3,4]. In this framework, baseline is sequentially updated at every observation of the forest cover after intervention, allowing for the effects of changes in the external environment to be taken into account. Ex-post approach, e.g., the use of synthetic control method (SCM), has been investigated in this context [ 2]. However, there still remain a ﬁnancing issue since result-based payment requires several years for project proponents to wait until they obtain the ﬁrst credit issuance. From investor’s perspective, ex- ante baseline projection is needed to quantify the risk of projects for their investment decision [ 5]. With those in mind, we can ﬁnd a need for the integration of both ex-ante baseline prediction before intervention and ex-post dynamic baseline updating at each observation after intervention. Summary of our contributions We propose a new model for solving the issue mentioned above. First, we introduce a Bayesian state-space model that naturally integrates the forecast of defor- estation baseline before intervention and the dynamic updating of baseline after intervention. We achieve this by combining state-space modeling for forecasting and SCM for dynamic updating.

A key concept of VM0007 is Reference Region for projecting rate of Deforestation (RRD), which is used as a control unit for estimating a baseline. An RRD is chosen so that the following variables are as close as possible to those of the Project Area (PA): deforestation drivers, landscape factors (e.g. forest types, soil types, elevation, etc.), and socio-economic variables (access to infrastructures, policies, and regulations, etc.). For the past 10–12 years before intervention, deforestation rates are aggregated over the RRD, and projected as a baseline for the crediting period. The projection method can be a simple historical average or a pre-deﬁned linear/non-linear model, where the former is often used (see Appendix for an example of RRD and baseline setting). Several studies have reported that baselines set under VM0007 were overestimated because they failed to consider a counterfactual scenario or to eliminate the effect of external factors, e.g., policy changes [ 2]. Causal inference for time-series data Synthetic Control Method (SCM) [ 7] is one of the most popular methods for causal inference with time-series data. This method is designed for a case with one treatment unit and multiple control units, which is suited for a REDD+ project setting. Given that an RRD consists of multiple sub-units (hereinafter “control units”), SCM ﬁnds an optimal weight to match both pre-intervention deforestation trends and covariates of the synthetic control (i.e. the weighted average of control units)\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
