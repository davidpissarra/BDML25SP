We consolidate more than 20 million wildﬁre records between 2000 and 2018 across the six continents. This data is processed with artiﬁcial intelligence methods to discover global ﬁre regimes, areas with characteristic ﬁre behavior over long periods. We discover 15 groups with clear differences in ﬁre-related historical behavior. Despite sharing historical ﬁre behavior, regions belonging to the same group present signiﬁcant differences in location and inﬂuencing factors.

The long cohabitation of vegetation and ﬁre has induced their co-evolution [25] and shaped adaptive strategies within different plant species. Our understanding of ﬁre activity and the relationship with its inﬂuencing factors is lacking, especially at large spatial scales [21] because of the absence of consistent long term data [20]. Although studies that characterize ﬁre activity at regional level are common [9, 10, 19, 24], the lack of long temporal series has limited the study and assessment of global ﬁre regimes [2, 7]. Several researchers have utilized global forest ﬁre data to investigate various questions including evaluating the impact of ﬁre on vegetation and emissions as well as studying factors inﬂuencing spatial and temporal ﬁre activity variation [13, 14, 17, 21, 29]. It has been demonstrated that changing environmental conditions and human activity can and will continue to modify ﬁre activity in several parts of the world. However, these ﬁndings have been primarily based on regional-scale studies. The relationship between vegetation and ﬁres, for a speciﬁc ecosystem, is characterized by a ﬁre regime or pyrome [3, 5, 25]. A ﬁre regime is deﬁned as a set of consistent and repeated wildﬁre Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.conditions in a particular region over a long period of time [18, 20]. These regimes depend on a combination of factors that inﬂuence ﬁre occurrence and behavior such as ignitions, fuel composition and arrangement, and conductive ﬁre weather [22]. Those ﬁre conditions that deﬁne a ﬁre regime [11, 20] have a clear impact not only on the presence of certain vegetation types but also on soil and atmospheric characteristics [7]. Increased understanding of ﬁre regimes will provide an essential knowledge for between regions sharing a regime. As a result, any study on factors altering ﬁre activity evolution or its impact will be signiﬁcantly improved if implemented per ﬁre regimes [2, 7]. In addition, the knowledge gathered could unveil useful insights and improve various studies, providing relevant information to characterize and assess the impact of current ﬁre regimes on ecological aspects such as vegetation adaptability, soil degradation, carbon stocks, air quality/pollution, and conservation of the biosphere [4, 15, 23, 28], impacting multiple areas of knowledge. We present a study on understanding of current global ﬁre regimes using AI and a statistical framework that analyzes yearly global wildﬁre events over 20 years.

The long cohabitation of vegetation and fire has induced their co-evolution and shaped adaptive strategies within different plant species. Our understanding of fire activity and the relationship with its influencing factors is lacking, especially at large spatial scales, due to the absence of consistent long-term data.

It has been demonstrated that changing environmental conditions and human activity can and will continue to modify fire activity in several parts of the world. However, these findings have been primarily based on regional-scale studies.\n\nThe relationship between vegetation and fires, for a specific ecosystem, is characterized by a fire regime or pyrome. A fire regime is defined as a set of consistent and repeated wildfire conditions in a particular region over a long period of time. These regimes depend on a combination of factors that influence fire occurrence and behavior, such as ignitions, fuel composition and arrangement, and conductive fire weather. Those fire conditions that define a fire regime have a clear impact not only on the presence of certain vegetation types but also on soil and atmospheric characteristics.
