We propose the use of a convolutional neural network architecture inspired by UNet++ and ResNet to predict thunderstorms as a binary classiﬁcation problem based on satellite images and lightnings recorded in the past. We achieve a probability of detection of more than 94% for lightnings within the next 15 minutes while at the same time minimizing the false alarm ratio compared to previous approaches. 1 Introduction Climate change will affect humanity in many ways over the next decades. Besides well known effects such as the melting polar caps and the increasing sea levels, recent studies also predict an increasing number of convective storms over the United States [ 17,7,4] and Europe [ 13]. Convective storms are often accompanied by lightning, heavy rain, hail, and sometimes also tornadoes. In ﬁelds such as aviation, thunderstorms can pose a real security threat if planes are not warned and detoured in time. Predicting such severe weather conditions is therefore a core task for weather services. However, even state-of-the-art systems such as NowCastMIX [ 9], a system operated by the German Meteorological Service, still struggle with a high false alarm ratio, especially if the forecast period is increased to one hour and beyond. Most weather models currently in operational mode are based on numerical weather prediction (NWP) and estimate the state of the atmosphere by applying transformations based on physical laws. Machine learning algorithms have however shown recent success in many ﬁelds, especially those providing large datasets for training. The availability of geostationary satellites, lightning detection networks and other data sources therefore encourages researchers to investigate the application of machine learning in the context of severe weather prediction. In this work, we are focusing on one small sub-problem, namely the prediction of lightning and thunderstorms. We propose the use of a convolutional neural network architecture inspired by UNet++ [ 19] and ResNet [ 6], very similar to the architecture used by Peng et al. [ 12]. Based on satellite images taken by the SEVIRI instrument onboard the current, second generation of Meteosat satellites [ 15] and past lightning observations registered by the LINET network [ 2], we try to predict whether there will be lightning or not in the future.T-30 T-15  T̂0 = TV -L1(T-30, T-15) T̂0 T0 Error =   |T̂0 - T0|  (a) Error computationinput (112,10,160,144)R0;0 R0;1 R0;2 R0;3 R1;0 R1;1 R1;2 R2;0 R2;1 R3;0F0;3output (112,1,166,144) skip connectionsdownsamplingupsampling (b) Architecture overview Figure 1: Data preprocessing & network architecture 2 Related Work Our approach is mainly based on satellite images, making convolutional neural networks a natural choice for the network. Considering the fact that we try to distinguish areas affected by thunderstorms and areas without such events, our work is closely related to the idea of image segmentation. Among the many architectures proposed in this ﬁeld throughout the last years, encoder-decoder networks have become state-of-the-art. Fully convolutional networks (FCN) [ 11] and UNet [ 14] are among the most successful and inﬂuential ones introducing the idea of skip connections. Follow-up works extended these base networks in different ways, among them H-DenseUNet [ 10] and UNet++ [ 19] which are inspired by dense connections between subsequent layers introduced in DenseNet [ 8]. In the related ﬁeld of image classiﬁcation, ResNet [ 6] introduced the idea of residual learning. Peng et al. [ 12] adopted the idea of residual learning for image segmentation tasks, introducing residual blocks in the UNet++ architecture. Our architecture follows the same idea and differs only in details. In the ﬁeld of convection and thunderstorm prediction, several research groups have published ﬁrst results using machine learning approaches. Some of these approaches are based on Random Forests as introduced by Breiman [ 3]. Ahijevych et al. [ 1] used parameters of a convection permitting model to predict convective system initiation. More recent works focus directly on the prediction of lightings. In a previous work [ 16], we proposed to use the error resulting from satellite image nowcasting as a feature for lightning prediction based on Random Forests. Geng et al. [ 5] used a different approach relying on NWP model parameters, lightning observations and a recurrent convolutional neural network. 3 Dataset & Preprocessing We follow the idea presented in our previous work [ 16], i.e. using the error of satellite image nowcasting as a feature for lightning prediction.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and data removed:\n\nWeather forecasting, particularly the prediction of thunderstorms and lightning, is a crucial task. We propose a convolutional neural network architecture inspired by UNet++ and ResNet to predict thunderstorms as a binary classification problem based on satellite images and past lightning observations. Our approach achieves a detection probability of over 94% for lightning within the next 15 minutes while minimizing the false alarm ratio compared to previous methods.\n\nClimate change will significantly impact humanity in the coming decades, with effects including rising sea levels and an increase in convective storms over the United States and Europe.
