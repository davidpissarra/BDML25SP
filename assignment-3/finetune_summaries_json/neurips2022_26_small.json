Among potential optimizations, data-driven dam operation policies using accurate river discharge forecasts have been advocated for. In the meantime, Machine Learning (ML) has recently made important strides in hydrological modeling, with forecast accuracy improvements demonstrated on both precipitation nowcasting and river discharge prediction. We are motivated by the convergence of these societal and technological contexts: our final goal is to provide scientific evidence and actionable insights for dam infrastructure managers and policy makers to implement more energy-efficient and flood-resistant dam operation policies on a national scale. Towards this goal this work presents a preliminary study of ML-based dam inflow forecasts on a dataset of 127 Japanese public dams we assembled. We discuss our preliminary results and lay out a path for future studies. 1 Introduction Dam operation is a problem of control under uncertainty, in which dam operators aim to maximize multiple objectives (flood protection, HP generation, etc.) given uncertain forecasts of river discharge flowing into dam reservoirs. The more accurate river discharge forecasting is, the more efficiently (in terms of both flood protection and HP generation) dams can be operated. The uncertainty in discharge forecast can be attributed to two main factors: Uncertainty in precipitation forecast (how much rain will fall) and uncertainty in hydrological modeling (how much of the rain will flow into rivers). High levels of uncertainty and abundant alternative energy sources have lead Japanese public dam operators to adopt conservative operation strategies sub-optimal for HP production. However two factors may come to challenge this status quo: First, social and environmental pressures on fossil fuels and nuclear energy production, combined with the rapid development of intermittent renewable energy sources, are foreseen to increase the value of HP generation. Second, advances in both environmental modeling and statistical inference models are foreseen to increase the accuracy of forecast, allowing for better-informed dam operation policies. Combined, these two factors may challenge the current risk-benefit analysis of dam operation towards more efficient operation policies. This work is part of a parent project that aims to provide both scientific evidence and actionable insights for dam infrastructure managers and policy makers to implement more energy-efficient and flood resistant dam operation policies on a national scale. In this work, we present the results of our Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: (Left) Current energy supply rates (Energy consumed / HP production) coming from HP (Center) Potential HP supply rate.

Many collected dams are located in prefectures with high potential for optimization. initial efforts, focusing on improving the accuracy of river discharge forecast inflowing to Japanese public dam reservoirs. To do so, we have assembled a dataset of public Japanese dams, which we present in Section 3, and proposed different ML discharge forecasting systems, which we evaluate in Section 4. Section 5 discusses our results and future works. Section 2 motivates our study with further background information. 2 Background A mountainous topology and a heavy rain climate lend Japan a high potential for hydro power generation. Historically, Japan has extensively relied on HP generation during the first half of the 20th century, favoring HP over fire-based energy for its base load supply. As the post-war period of great economic development called for increased energy consumption, fossil fuel plants were preferred to HP for their ability to quickly and efficiently answer the rapid increase in demand. Later, the oil shock has seen Japan strategically develop nuclear power generation to ensure its energy independence. Due to longer infrastructure development times, HP lost its competitiveness in times of rapidly moving energy needs, so that its operating infrastructure has been comparatively little optimized [1]. Today, nuclear incidents and international pledges to reduce carbon emissions have come to threaten the long term viability of Japanâ€™s current energy mix. While solar and wind power generation are being intensively developed, their intermittent nature does not allow them to cover for the base load and demand response capacity provided by fossil fuel plants. In this context HP generation is seen as a valuable low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for both base load and demand response needs to complement the development of intermittent renewable energy sources. For all its benefits, several voices from the MLIT have been advocating for a more efficient use of Japanese water resources towards HP generation [1,2]. Figure 1, drawn from a 2019 report on the state and future of Japanese HP [1], shows the current rate of energy demand supplied by HP per prefecture, and contrasts it to potentially achievable supply rates, illustrating large potential benefits. Among the potential optimization, the implementation of power efficient dam operation policies powered by accurate river discharge forecasts has been identified as a high potential candidate. Furthermore, climate change is expected to have a deep impact on surface water distribution in Japan [7], with impacting local disparities, including decreased snow melt in the northern and Japan sea regions, increased drought periods in the south, and increased flooding risks due to heavy rain events across the country. Both the destabilization of surface water distribution and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
