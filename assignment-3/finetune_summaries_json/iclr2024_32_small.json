Hy- drothermal synthesis is a widely used method for zeolite production, offering control over crystallinity and and pore size. However, the intricate interplay of synthesis parameters necessitates a comprehensive understanding to optimize the synthesis process. We train a supervised classification machine learning model on ZeoSyn (a dataset of zeolite synthesis routes) to predict the zeolite framework product given a synthesis route. Subsequently, we leverage SHapley Additive Ex- planations (SHAP) to reveal key synthesis-structure relationships in zeolites. To that end, we introduce an aggregation SHAP approach to extend such analysis to explain the formation of composite building units (CBUs) of zeolites. Analysis at this unprecedented scale sheds light on key synthesis parameters driving zeolite crystallization. 1 I NTRODUCTION Zeolites are nanoporous, crystalline aluminosilicate materials with a wide range of industrial appli- cations including catalysis, separations, and carbon capture Davis (2002); Boer et al. (2023). While thousands of potential zeolite structures are thought to be thermodynamically accessible Pophale et al. (2011), only about 260 have been synthesized, highlighting a synthesis bottleneck to zeolite discovery and deployment. The synthesis of zeolites synthesis is intricate, with numerous vari- ables influencing the resultant zeolite structure Corma & Davis (2004), such as types and amounts of framework elements, the presence of inorganic and organic cations, structure-directing agents, mineralizing agents and hydrothermal conditions.

Machine learning has the poten- tial in generalizing some of these relationshipsCorma et al. (2006); Serra et al. (2007); Jensen et al. (2019); Muraoka et al. (2019) but have been limited to subsections of the zeolite design space due to a lack of data. We leverage ZeoSyn (Fig. S3), a comprehensive dataset of 23,925 zeolite synthesis routes for >200 unique zeolite frameworks (an order of magnitude larger than all previously published zeolite syn- thesis datasets). We train a supervised classification machine learning model on ZeoSyn to predict zeolite framework products given a synthesis route. We employ SHapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to reveal key synthesis parameters driving the formation of over 200 zeolite frameworks and their constituent composite building units (CBUs), and show potential applications in phase- selective and intergrowth synthesis.
