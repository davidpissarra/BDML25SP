Combining optical satel- lite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric col- umn density air pollution measurements enables the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case NO2) to high spatial resolution (up to \u001810m) at arbitrary locations and adds a temporal compo- nent to these estimates.

Besides the primary greenhouse gas, CO2, the burning of fossil fuels also emits molecules like NO2and CO, which have been used as proxy for the esti- mation of CO 2emissions (Berezin et al., 2013). Detailed information about sources and distribution of air pollutants within the atmosphere is of high relevance for a number of applications with climate change impact, including the compilation of emission inventories (Eggleston et al., 2006), the design and implementation of pollution limits (Bollen & Brink, 2014), and the quantiÔ¨Åcation of large anthropogenic emissions (Liu et al., 2020). At present, continual data on air pollution concentrations in the atmosphere are primarily collected through two different approaches with distinct drawbacks. On the Earth‚Äôs surface, networks of measurement stations record the concentration of various chemicals at select locations (Guerreiro et al., 2014). Such networks are commonly run by environmental agencies and provide frequent measurements while often lacking in spatial coverage. This drawback can be partly ad- dressed by space-borne air pollution monitoring: satellites equipped with spectrometers measure the abundance of se- lect molecules in the form of atmospheric column densities (Gupta et al., 2006).

The heatmaps are constructed from individual predictions for overlapping 120 \u0002120 pixel tiles of the top image and corresponding Sentinel-5P data, resulting in an effective spatial resolution of 100m. This approach is equally applicable to locations without air quality stations, providing a means to map air pollution on the surface level to identify sources of air pollution and GHG emissions (see Fig. A1 for more examples). allows satellites to frequently map most locations on Earth, remote sensing spectrometers currently only provide spatial resolutions in the kilometer range and with little information about the pollutant‚Äôs vertical distribution.

Introduction\n\nAir pollution and the emission of GHGs is the main cause of climate change, with annual global emission levels still on the rise (Friedlingstein et al., 2019).
