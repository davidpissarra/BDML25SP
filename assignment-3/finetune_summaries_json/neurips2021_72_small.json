There is an urgent need to speed up the development of new portfolio of crop varieties with traits of adaptation and mitigation to climate change. We have used mathematical approaches, including machine learning approaches (ML), leading to unprecedented results as some of the traits, which have been long sought-for, have been found within a short period of time. 1 Climate change - a dual challenge Climate change poses a serious challenge to achieving food security. It is a dual challenge that requires keeping up with the world’s increasing demand for food, while adapting to and mitigating climate change. The agriculture sector is in the midst of climate change, in a time of a need to keep pace and produce more food to close the gap of 56 percent between the amount of food available today and that required by the year 2050 (WRI 2021). 1.1 Why the need for speed The average yield of maize crop in Iowa State (USA) during the year 2012, which one of the driest year in a half century, is equivalent to the average yield of the 1980s known for more favorable conditions for plant growth. The genetic gain that was made during the period of 30 years of crop improvement is considerable (Atlin et al. 2017). However, With current frequent dry spells, there is a need to speed up further the rate of the genetic gain. To speed plant improvement Koo and Wright (2000) found that early identification of valuable crop traits is of equal importance to the process of incorporating these traits into an improved genetic background. To help speed up the development of new crops varieties with traits to adapt to and mitigate changing climate conditions, we have used mathematical approaches, including machine learning techniques. Mathematical approaches have played a major role in producing more food, prior to the emergence of molecular approaches. Fisher (1930) elaborated the mathematical theoretical framework that was considered as the basis of quantitative genetic theory, leading to impressive gains in yields (Scheffé 1959). ∗Operational AI to speed up and streamline operational processes at the edge of the Cloud. a.bari@operai.ca 35th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2021).1.2 Why portfolio of varieties There is currently an interest in the use of mathematical and machine learning approaches to accelerate and optimize further crop improvement processes to develop new portfolio of diverse crop varieties with enhanced traits (Anderssen and Edwards 2012, Bari et al. 2016, Parmley et al. 2019, Tong and Nikoloski 2021). Diversified systems have been reported to raise productivity and improve livelihoods, performing particularly well under environmental stress and delivering production increases in places where additional food is desperately needed (De Schutter and Frison 2017). 2 Modeling - Evolutionary processes To mimic evolutionary processes that drive traits natural adaptation in plants we opted for inverse problem modeling involving ML. The inverse problem using actual field observations to estimate values that are not easily directly observed in the field, such as heat and drought traits. We used different machine-learning techniques to accelerate the search for these traits. The techniques span supervised and unsupervised techniques, including Bayes, Neural Network (NN), Random Forest and K-means techniques, to help in the rapid identification of adaptive traits (Cherkassky and Mulier 2007, Khazaei et al. 2013, Bari et al. 2016, Bari 2018). The ML-based search for these adaptive traits is based on exploring and exploiting the dependence between the desired traits (denoted Y) and the environment (denoted X) as an evolutionary co-driver prevailing in the areas where the samples were originally sampled (Henry and Nevo 2014). The performance of ML models was assessed using Kappa and AUC values (Fawcett 2006). The desired traits are considered as representative variables with the additive influence of many genes with small effects (Brown et al. 1996). Crop simulation models combined with high-resolution climate change map scenarios can help to identify key traits that are important under drought and high temperature stresses in crops (Semenov and Halford 2009). 2.1 Traits of adaptation to drought To identify traits of adaptation to drought, we used the faba bean ( Vicia faba L.) crop, which is a widely grown food legume crop in the dry areas and is being considered as one of the most likely crop to be impacted by climate change (Duc et al. 2011). Cumulative plant datasets from experiments on faba bean were used to explore the link between the trait expression (Y) and the environment (X). A total of 400 plant samples was originally selected on the basis of extreme “wet” and “dry” environmental profiles using a clustering algorithm from thousands of samples stored in the genebank. From these 400, a first subset was used to detect the presence of patterns\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",

It requires balancing the world's increasing demand for food with adapting to and mitigating climate change.
