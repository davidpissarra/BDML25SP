In ESMs such as NASA GISS-E2.1 (hereafter referred to as ModelE), pre-computed monthly-averaged atmospheric composition concentrations are often used to reduce computational expenses. This approach is referred to as Non-Interactive Tracers (NINT). In this study, we extend the NINT version of the ModelE using machine learning to emulate the effects of interactive emissions on climate forcing. We use data from a fully interactive composition climate model with surface-driven emissions to develop an ML-based NINT climate model. This version accounts for instantaneous atmospheric con- ditions, enabling the tracers to respond dynamically to meteorology without the need for explicit calculation of tracer transport. This approach could be applied to any aerosol species and integrated into ESMs to simulate aerosol concentrations interactively. The proposed framework emulates the advection term at the surface pressure level, with a focus on predicting surface-level concentrations of Black Carbon (BC) from biomass burning, which is a contributor to elevated levels of PM2.5 concentrations. Two consecutive years of ModelE simulated data were used as training data. To capture both temporal and spatial dependencies, a Convolu- tional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model was used. Results show the ConvLSTM achieved an average R2of 0.85 ( σ= 0.08) on the test set. In contrast, using monthly-averaged atmospheric composition concentrations resulted in an average R2of 0.42 ( σ= 0.73) for the same period. ∗Corresponding author ( se2639@columbia.edu ) Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.1 Introduction Earth System Models (ESMs) are foundational tools in climate science, simulating atmospheric dynamics by numerically solving fluid flow equations on a 3D grid box. However, the complexity of the atmosphere requires that sub-grid scale processes–such as turbulence, convection, and radiation– be represented through semi-empirical parameterizations [ 1]. Among these, representing atmospheric composition and chemistry remains one of the greatest challenges, as uncertainties in this area are considerably higher compared to other climate system forcings. For instance, modeling aerosol radiative forcing is particularly difficult due to the complex and transient nature of aerosols, their interactions with radiation, and their influence on cloud processes. Further complicating this task are the uncertainties in both natural and anthropogenic emissions, which affect the spatiotemporal distribution of aerosols in the atmosphere [2]. A specific case of this challenge can be observed in the NASA GISS-E2.1 climate model used for Coupled Model Intercomparison Project v.6 (CMIP6) simulations. This model does not include online interactive composition; instead, it relies on prescribed monthly aerosol and ozone concentration fields. These fields are calculated prognostically using the One-Moment Aerosol (OMA) version of the model [ 2,3]. While this approach significantly reduces computational demands, it introduces notable drawbacks. By depending on pre-calculated fields, the model may fail to accurately capture real-time feedback between aerosol (source, transport, and sink) and other climate variables, potentially leading to inaccuracies in the simulation of climate dynamics. This approach critically constrains our capacity to model the interactions between a changing climate and surface-level air quality, the contributions of transient emission sources such as forest fires to direct radiative forcing, and the role of aerosols in modulating cloud processes through indirect climate forcing. Recently, machine learning (ML) has emerged as a promising tool to address these and other challenges in climate modeling. For example, ML techniques such as super-resolution adversarial deep learning have been used to downscale GCM data to resolutions sufficient for climate impact studies [ 4]. Additionally, ML can emulate existing parameterizations to reduce computational costs [ 5], or even replace traditional methods by capturing latent relationships between climate subcomponents that are difficult to model through physical process parameterizations [ 6,7,8]. However, despite these advancements, significant challenges remain, particularly in achieving stable prognostic inference within fully coupled simulations. The primary issue here is stability, which is closely tied to generalization–the ability of ML models to perform well under conditions not encountered during training [ 9]. To mitigate this challenge, selecting an appropriate architecture with a suitable inductive bias is crucial, as it enhances the model’s ability to generalize beyond the training data [10].
