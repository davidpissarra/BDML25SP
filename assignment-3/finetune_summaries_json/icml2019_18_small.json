It is used throughout the site screening, permitting, designing, operating, moni- toring and closure processes (NETL, 2017). In a geological formation, the migration of the CO 2is controlled by a com- plex interplay of viscous, capillary, and gravity forces. Once CO2is injected into the formation, it migrates away from the injection well while rising upward since CO 2is lighter than the formation ﬂuid. The injected CO 2is subject to the risk of leakage if it encounters permeable faults or leaky well bores. Figure 1 shows a schematic of a CO 2plume in a geological formation. Current modeling approaches solve the relevant mass and energy balances using a set of spatially and temporally dis- cretized nonlinear partial differential equations. However, this process is often computationally intractable due to the heterogeneity of geological formations, large spatial do- mains, and the long time frame of CO 2sequestration (NAS, 2018). The problem is confounded by the inherent uncertainty as- sociated with the subsurface geology. Uncertainty analysis with stochastic simulations can be used to obtain probabilis- tic estimates of plume migration. However, stochastic simu- lations are limited by computational resources. Meanwhile, the model calibration process requires history-matching sim- ulation models with monitoring data in an iterative fashion, which also requires huge computational resources (Kempka et al., 2010; Strandli et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Cowton 1Energy Resource Engineering, Stanford University, USA.

In recent years, we have seen some encouraging studies that apply neural networks to subsurface ﬂow problems (Zhu & Zabaras, 2018; Mo et al., 2019).

The injection time is added as an additional scalar input to the network and broadcast to a separate channel in the latent space to make predictions over time. Extending on previous works, here we take an essential step by embedding spatial information in controlling parameters such as injection location and duration.

In a geological formation, the migration of CO2 is controlled by a complex interplay of viscous, capillary, and gravity forces. Once CO2 is injected into the formation, it migrates away from the injection well while rising upward since CO2 is lighter than the formation fluid. The injected CO2 is subject to the risk of leakage if it encounters permeable faults or leaky well bores.
