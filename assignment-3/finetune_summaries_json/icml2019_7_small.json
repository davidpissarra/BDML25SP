The framework is implemented in a fully empirical, data-driven manner by representing the evolution and mea- surement operators via matrices in a basis learned from time-ordered observations. Applications to data assimilation of the Ni ˜no 3.4 index for the El Ni˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a compre- hensive climate model show promising results. 1. Introduction Data assimilation is a framework for state estimation and prediction for partially observed dynamical systems (Majda & Harlim, 2012; Law et al., 2015). Adopting a predictor- corrector approach, it employs a forward model to evolve the probability distribution for the system state until a new observation is acquired, at which time that probability dis- tribution is updated in an analysis step to a posterior dis- tribution correcting for model error and/or uncertainty in the prior distribution. Since the seminal work of Kalman (1960) on ﬁltering (which utilizes Bayes’ theorem for the analysis step, under the assumption that all distributions are Gaussian), data assimilation has evolved to an indispensable tool in modeling and forecasting of the climate system. *Equal contribution1Department of Physics, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA2Courant In- stitute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University, New York, New York, USA.

Copyright 2019 by the author(s).Major challenges in data assimilation of the climate system are caused by the extremely large number of active degrees of freedom in the dynamics, evolving under nonlinear, and oftentimes partially known, equations of motion. These issues affect both the forward models (which invariably employ approximations such as subgrid-scale parameteriza- tion) and analysis procedures (where direct application of Bayes’ theorem is generally not feasible). The past decades have seen vigorous research, leading to the creation of a vast array of operational data assimilation techniques for the weather and climate aiming to address these issues, includ- ing variational (Bannister, 2016), ensemble (Karspeck et al., 2018), and particle (van Leuuwen et al., 2019) methods. In this work, we present a new method for data assimilation of climate dynamics combining aspects of quantum mechan- ics, operator-theoretic ergodic theory (Eisner et al., 2015), and kernel methods for machine learning. This approach re- sults in a fully data-driven scheme, formulated entirely, and without approximation of the underlying dynamics, through linear evolution operators on spaces of observables. We demonstrate the utility of the method in a data assimilation experiment targeting the Ni ˜no 3.4 index for the El Ni ˜no Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in the Community Climate System Model Version 4 (CCSM4) (Gent et al., 2011). 2. Quantum mechanical data assimilation The quantum mechanical data assimilation (QMDA) scheme employed in this work (Giannakis, 2019) is based on the ob- servation that the predictor-corrector structure of data assim- ilation resembles the dynamics and measurement formalism of quantum mechanics, whereby the system state evolves under unitary dynamics between measurements (analogous to the forward modeling step in data assimilation) and under projective dynamics during measurements (the so-called “wavefunction collapse”, analogous to the analysis step in data assimilation). Since quantum mechanics is inherently a statistical theory, formulated entirely through linear op- erators, it is natural to explore whether its formalism can be adapted to the context of data assimilation of classical dynamical systems. Importantly, such a scheme would be amenable to rigorous analysis and approximation through well-developed techniques in linear operator theory, har- monic analysis, and related ﬁelds.Quantum Mechanical Data Assimilation for Climate Dynamics In order to construct a concrete data assimilation scheme from the abstract quantum mechanical axioms, we employ ideas from Koopman operator theory (Eisner et al., 2015). This framework characterizes a given measure-preserving dynamical system through intrinsically linear operators on a Hilbert space, called Koopman operators (Koopman, 1931; Kooopman & von Neumann, 1931), governing the evolution of observables (functions of the state) under the dynam- ics. Mathematically, such Koopman operators have closely related properties to the Heisenberg evolution operators in\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
