Based on this data, a newly developed Long-Short Term Memory Encoder-decoder neural network model is trained, incorporating a Multi-head Self Attention mechanism in the decoder. The model shows promising results, making the prediction of optical flow vectors from pure model predictions possible. 1 Introduction Glaciers and their inherent dynamics are a well-documented indicator for global climate change [1,31,4,9,26,24,15,23,30,5]. Together with ice sheets, they also cover 10% of the Earth’s land area, holding about 69% of Earth’s freshwater [ 11]. Their monitoring is crucial for local authorities, as glacier melting can have impacts on close-by regions like landslides, debris flows, rock slope failures or ice avalanches [ 26]. To study the impacts of glacial change, advanced remote sensing approaches have been developed, including, e.g., terrestrial laser scanning, radar satellite applications, unmanned aerial vehicles, automatic camera imaging, and multispectral satellite imaging [4]. Many models of glacier dynamics explicitly focus on the physical processes inside glaciers [ 8,5]. This approach comes with the disadvantage of varying estimates of different models, uncertainties of different data sources, varying estimates of the same models by different research groups, and the need for explicit knowledge of the underlying processes for parameter estimation and data prediction. Therefore, deep learning methods have been deployed for glacier movement prediction from satellite data [ 16], where glacier dynamics are modelled indirectly through input-output relations. Recently, deep learning, and especially computer vision, has made large progress due to the ability to learn complex recurrent patterns, the emergence and improvement of advanced neural network architectures [27], as well as the use of higher computational resources in model training [ 3] and larger datasets [ 6]. Based on these advancements, the present study focuses on the application of recurrent deep-learning models to predict the movement of the Parvati glacier using satellite images. Although recurrent neural networks (RNN) have been used to predict sea ice motion (e.g. Mu et al. [17], Zhai and Bitz [32], Petrou and Tian [19,20]), most papers investigating glaciers focus on classification approaches (e.g. Chu et al. [7], Marochov et al. [13], Prieur et al. [22]) instead of predicting future glacier states with RNNs. Our approach is, therefore, inspired by sea ice motion prediction. We use scene patches, similar to Min et al. [16] and Petrou and Tian [19], apply a dense optical flow algorithm as V onica et al. [28] and rely on an LSTM self-attention hybrid model inspired Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.by Mu et al. [17]. We compare our approach to an LSTM encoder-decoder structure, similar to Ali et al. [2], and a ConvLSTM model. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to use an attention- based RNN for glacier movement prediction from satellite image time-series data. Therefore, this paper presents a unique opportunity to contribute to understanding large climate change detection indicators. 2 Data and Model Figure 1. Glacier development over time. The processing patches are highlighted in blue.The generated datasets consist of Landsat-8 level 2 satellite images of the Parvati glacier accessed through the SpatioTemporal Asset Cat- alog (STAC)1. Because Landsat-8 imaging is not completely accurate [ 28], the images need to be aligned, for which we use the En- hanced Correlation Coefficient Maximization algorithm [ 10] to compensate for pixel shifts in images and produce more robust model pre- dictions. We also filter the data for images within the glacier scene (77.4880◦E, 31.9927◦N, 77.8206◦E, 32.2253◦N) with less than 20% cloud coverage and less than 50% of missing pixel values and use two out of the 19 bands pro- vided at 30m resolution to estimate the glacier movements: the green band (green, 0,53−0,59 micrometers) and the shortwave infrared one band (swir1, 1.57−1.65micrometers). These bands still contain missing pixel values; thus, we use a 5x5 kernel to calculate a weighted average for the missing pixel in question [ 28]. We can then compute the Normalized Difference Snow Index NDSI = (green −swir1) /(green + swir1), which quantifies snow or ice in [−1,1]. This NDSI index is for example used to classify glaciers with a U-net architecture [ 12] with a multitude of\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
