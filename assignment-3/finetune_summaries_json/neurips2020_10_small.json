However, existing Sun tracking methods rely on external data and a calibration of the camera, which requires access to the device. To address these limitations, this study introduces an image-based Sun tracking algorithm to localise the Sun in the image when it is visible and interpolate its daily trajectory from past observations. We validate the method on a set of sky images collected over a year at SIRTA’s lab. Experimental results show that the proposed method provides robust smooth Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below 1% of the image size. 1 Introduction The share of renewables in the global power mix is growing rapidly, with solar energy accounting for the largest growth [1]. However, the uncertainty and inherent variability of electricity production from photovoltaic panels is a major challenge for grid operators. Power system constraints and demand-supply balancing are among factors that currently limit its integration into the energy mix [2]. Improving solar electricity generation forecasting at different time-scales would mitigate these effects by facilitating battery, fossil fuel backup or grid management [3 –5]. Beside statistical approaches, methods based on hemispherical sky cameras have fostered increased interest for short-term irradiance prediction. They provide high spatiotemporal resolution forecasts able to anticipate rapid irradiance ﬂuctuations by capturing cloud cover changes over a solar facility [6]. Because most of the incoming radiation originates from direct sunlight, a cloud hiding the Sun might cause a signiﬁcant 80% power drop within a minute. Consequently, short-term irradiance forecasting methods based on sky images largely use the position of the Sun in the image as a reference to predict the impact of the cloud cover dynamics on radiation changes [7–9]. Tracking the Sun position in the image is generally achieved by additional Sun tracking devices or through a well deﬁned approach based on the relative position of the observer on Earth relative to the Sun [10, 11]. Following this procedure, the angular position of the Sun is accurately estimated with an uncertainty of \u00060:0003\u000e[10]. The main drawback of these methods is the translation of the angular coordinates into pixels, which must take into account the position and orientation of the camera and the strong distortion of the ﬁsh-eye lens. This can be a serious obstacle for researchers willing to use existing publicly available datasets [12, 13], thus penalising open research in irradiance Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.forecasting. Alternatively, image-based Sun tracking methods have been proposed, but they only work when the Sun is visible [14, 15], which limits their applicability to solar radiation applications. To overcome this difﬁculty, we propose an alternative data-driven method based on the analysis of sky images only. From the observation that pixels corresponding to the Sun appear saturated in sky images, we robustly estimate the Sun’s position in the image when it is visible. Following this we take advantage of the smooth trajectory of the Sun in the image from one minute to another, but also from day to day, to predict its daily trajectory from past observations only. We present quantitative and qualitative results of this approach and hope that future works will aim at validating the technique by comparing it to traditional methods. Dataset The dataset used in this study was kindly shared by SIRTA’s lab [12]. It is composed of several years of ground-taken sky images with a temporal resolution of 2 min. At each time step, two captures of the cloud cover are taken with a long (1/100 sec) and a short exposure (1/2000 sec). The only preprocessing applied to images is an azimuthal equidistant projection aiming at diminishing the lens distortion (see Appendix A). 2 Methods The proposed framework is composed of three steps. Firstly, a binary classiﬁer sorts images into two groups, ‘visible Sun’ or ‘hidden Sun’, based on the relative intensity of pixels in the image. If the Sun is visible, its position is estimated from its corresponding saturated pixels. Finally, the trajectory of the Sun over a day is interpolated from observations from previous days using supervised learning. Binary classiﬁcation The suggested classiﬁcation decision is based on the maximal intensity of pixels in the images (Equation 1): the Sun is assumed to be visible if the highest intensity pixel Imax is above a percentage pof the theoretical max Itheoreticalmax. Often available in sky image datasets [12, 16], images taken with a short exposure offer a higher contrast between the Sun and the background, while keeping the saturated area narrow, facilitating accurate Sun localisation (See Figure 1). To simplify the processing of images, the threshold method was applied to the blue channel of the short exposure image, which offers the highest contrast.1 Sun is visible,Imax>pItheoreticalmax [herep= 0:99and Itheoreticalmax = 255] (1) Sun localisation When the Sun is visible,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
