However, current deep learning models are based on convolutional neural networks which are difﬁcult to interpret and can fail to model large-scale atmospheric patterns called teleconnections. Hence, we propose the application of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to forecast ENSO at long lead times, ﬁner granularity and improved predictive skill than current state-of-the-art methods.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is an irregularly recurring phenomenon involving ﬂuctuating temperatures—the alternation of warm El Niño and cold La Niña conditions—in the tropical Paciﬁc Ocean. It is a major driver of climate variability, causes disasters such as ﬂoods, droughts and heavy rains in various regions of the world [ 1;2;3;4;5;6;7] and has implications for agriculture [8;9;10] and public health [ 11;12;13;14]. Worldwide teleconnections, i.e. interlinked, large-scale phenomena, as well as the high variability regarding its manifestations have kept long-term ENSO forecasts at traditionally low skill. While previous studies indicate that more frequent, long-term or variable El Niño conditions may result due to global warming from greenhouse gases [ 15;16;17;18], the extent of inﬂuence climate change will have on ENSO is yet unknown and still debated given its complexity [ 19;20;21;22;23]. This work proposes the ﬁrst application of graph neural networks to seasonal forecasting and shows initial results that outperform existing dynamical and deep learning ENSO models for 1 and 3 lead months. 2 Related Works The forecasting methods in use can be broadly classiﬁed into dynamical and statistical systems [22;24;25]. The former are based on physical processes/climate models (e.g. atmosphere–ocean coupled models), while the latter are data-driven (including ML based approaches). Machine Learning for ENSO forecasting Recently, deep learning was successfully used to forecast ENSO 1 yrahead [ 26] as well as with a lead time of up to 1:5 yrs [27], thus out-performing state-of-the-art dynamical methods. Both project the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for various lead times. The former only use the ONI index time series as input of a temporal Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), while the latter feed sea surface temperature (SST) and heat content anomaly maps data to a CNN. Most statistical methods can only predict the single-valued index, an averaged metric over SST anomalies that does not convey more zonal information. A notable exception, makes use of an encoder-decoder approach [ 28]. An overview over other machine learning methods used to project ENSO, is given in [29]. Climate networks In climate networks [ 30], which stem from the ﬁeld of complex networks, each grid cell of a climate dataset is considered as a network node and edges between pairs of nodes are set up using some similarity measure. They have been used to detect and characterize SST teleconnections [ 31] and to successfully project ENSO 1 yrprior [ 32]. The latter exploits the observation that, a year before an ENSO event, a large-scale cooperative mode seems to link the equatorial Paciﬁc corridor (“El Niño basin”) and the rest of the Paciﬁc ocean. Graph neural networks In the past years, GNNs have surged as a popular sub-area of research within machine learning [ 33]. Interestingly, they have scarcely been used in earth and atmospheric sciences—a few applications using them for earthquake source detection [ 34], power outage prediction [35] and wind-farm power estimation [ 36]. GNNs have just recently been extended to spatiotemporal settings, with a focus on trafﬁc forecasting [37; 38; 39; 40]. Our GNN approach to ENSO forecasting builds on the climate network’s precedent of describing climate as a network of nodes related by non-local connections. Based on this precedent and the recent success of GNNs for spatiotemporal tasks, it is expected that spatiotemporal GNNs will be able to learn the large\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nThe El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a recurring climate phenomenon characterized by fluctuations in tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures, alternating between warm El Niño and cold La Niña conditions. It is a major driver of climate variability, leading to disasters such as floods, droughts, and heavy rains in various regions worldwide, and has implications for agriculture and public health. Despite its importance, long-term ENSO forecasts have traditionally been challenging due to its complex nature and high variability.\n\nRecent studies suggest that more frequent, long-term, or variable El Niño conditions may result from global warming caused by greenhouse gases, but the extent of climate change's influence on ENSO is still unknown and debated. This work proposes the first application of graph neural networks to seasonal forecasting and presents initial results that outperform existing dynamical and deep learning ENSO models for 1 and 3-month lead times.\n\nThe forecasting methods in use can be broadly classified into dynamical and statistical systems. Dynamical systems are based on physical processes and climate models, while statistical systems are data-driven, including machine learning approaches. Recent deep learning methods have successfully forecasted ENSO up to 1 year ahead and up to 1.5 years ahead, outperforming state-of-the-art dynamical methods. These methods project the Oceanic Niño Index (ONI) for various lead times, using either the ONI index time series or sea surface temperature (SST) and heat content anomaly maps as input.\n\nMost statistical methods can only predict the single-valued index, an averaged metric over SST anomalies that does not convey more zonal information. A notable exception uses an encoder-decoder approach. Climate networks, which stem from the field of complex networks, have been used to detect and characterize SST teleconnections and to project ENSO up to 1 year prior. Graph neural networks have recently been applied to various fields, including earthquake source detection, power outage prediction, and wind-farm power estimation. Our approach builds on the climate network's precedent of describing climate as a network of nodes related by non-local connections, and we expect that spatiotemporal GNNs will be able to learn the large-scale, spatiotemporal patterns indicative of ENSO.\n\nThe proposed method uses spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to forecast ENSO at long lead times, finer granularity, and improved predictive skill than current state-of-the-art methods. The explicit modeling of information flow via edges may also allow for more interpretable forecasts. Preliminary results are promising and outperform state-of-the-art systems for projections 1 and 3 months ahead."
