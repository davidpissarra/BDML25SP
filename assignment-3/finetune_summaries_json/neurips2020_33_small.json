Most of the models described in the literature are based on Time Use Survey data and Markov chains. Due to the nature of the underlying data and the Markov property, it is not sufﬁciently possible to consider day to day dependencies in occupant behavior. An accurate mapping of day to day dependencies is of increasing importance for accurately reproducing mobility patterns and therefore for assessing the charging ﬂexibility of electric vehicles. This study bridges the gap between energy related activity modelling and novel machine learning approaches with the objective to better incorporate ﬁndings from the ﬁeld of social practice theory in the simulation of occupancy behavior. Weekly mobility data are merged with daily time use survey data by using attention based models. In a ﬁrst step an autoregressive model is presented, which generates synthetic weekly mobility schedules of individual occupants and thereby captures day to day dependencies in mobility behavior. In a second step, an imputation model is presented, which enriches the weekly mobility schedules with detailed information about energy relevant at home activities. The weekly activity proﬁles build the basis for modelling consistent electricity, heat and mobility demand proﬁles of households. Furthermore, the approach presented forms the basis for providing data on socio-demographically differentiated occupant behavior to the general public. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.1 Introduction Occupant behavior has been identiﬁed as having a signiﬁcant impact on household energy consump- tion [ 12]. Therefore, there has been an increasing research interest in the ﬁeld of behavioral modelling over the last years with the aim to explain dynamics in residential energy demand based on energy related activities [ 13,14]. A large number of studies focus on the modelling of activity sequences of single households or individuals with the objective to describe occupant behavior on an aggregated level for socio-demographic differentiated groups [ 10,17,6,1]. Time use data (TUD) are used as a data basis, which provide information on the temporal course of occupant activities over single days and are available for various countries in the form of population representative samples [ 4]. Based on occupant behavior, different approaches were developed that connect occupant activities with electrical household appliances and thus generate synthetic electricity demand proﬁles [ 18]. The aim of these studies is to gain a deeper understanding of household electricity demand in order to e.g. be able to evaluate device-speciﬁc efﬁciency measures, time-dependent electricity tariffs or load shift potentials. In the course of the decarbonisation of domestic heat demand, it is expected that a large part of the heat will be generated by electricity (e.g. through heat pumps). In order to decarbonise the mobility sector, the aim is to increase the amount of electric vehicles in e.g. Germany from 53,861 in 2018 to 6,000,000 by 2030 [ 7,2]. Due to the mentioned developments, fundamental characteristics will change in the course of energy demand in the household sector. Furthermore, the introduction of stationary and mobile electricity storage systems as well as stationary heat storage systems enable the storage of energy over periods of single days and therefore open up ﬂexibility potentials in the residential sector, which can support the integration of ﬂuctuating renewable energies. To evaluate these ﬂexibility potentials, data are required that contain information about the mobility behavior of individuals over several days and about their energy relevant at home activities. TUD only provide information on activity patterns of two or three individual days, therefore longer-term dependencies in behavior that extend over several days are not captured in existing TUD based models [ 13]. The objective of this study is to develop an approach which captures long-term dependencies in behavior in order to be able to provide high quality mobility and activity data of individuals to the general public. Therefore, the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 provides an overview of the literature in the ﬁeld of categorical (activity) sequence modelling.

Therefore, there has been an increasing research interest in the field of behavioral modeling over the last years with the aim to explain dynamics in residential energy demand based on energy-related activities. A large number of studies focus on the modeling of activity sequences of single households or individuals with the objective to describe occupant behavior on an aggregated level for socio-demographically differentiated groups. Time use data (TUD) are used as a data basis, which provide information on the temporal course of occupant activities over single days and are available for various countries in the form of population-representative samples. Based on occupant behavior, different approaches were developed that connect occupant activities with electrical household appliances and thus generate synthetic electricity demand profiles. The aim of these studies is to gain a deeper understanding of household electricity demand in order to, for example, evaluate device-specific efficiency measures, time-dependent electricity tariffs, or load shift potentials. In the course of the decarbonization of domestic heat demand, it is expected that a large part of the heat will be generated by electricity (e.g., through heat pumps). In order to decarbonize the mobility sector, the aim is to increase the amount of electric vehicles in, for example, Germany from 53,861 in 2018 to 6,000,000 by 2030. Due to the mentioned developments, fundamental characteristics will change in the course of energy demand in the household sector. Furthermore, the introduction of stationary and mobile electricity storage systems as well as stationary heat storage systems enable the storage of energy over periods of single days and therefore open up flexibility potentials in the residential sector, which can support the integration of fluctuating renewable energies. To evaluate these flexibility potentials, data are required that contain information about the mobility behavior of individuals over several days and about their energy-relevant at-home activities. TUD only provide information on activity patterns of two or three individual days, therefore longer-term dependencies in behavior that extend over several days are not captured in existing TUD-based models.\n\nThe objective of this study is to develop an approach which captures long-term dependencies in behavior in order to be able to provide high-quality mobility and activity data of individuals to the general public.
