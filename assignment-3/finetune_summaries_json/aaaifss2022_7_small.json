Since 1975, the US Government has utilized the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES) to produce data that can enhance weather and climate mod- els, thus allowing for more precise and quicker weather forecasting and a better knowledge of long-term climate conditions (NASA 2015; Dunbar and Garner 2021). Using informative GOES data can help with wildfire prediction and detection, as current data has shown, more and more wildfires are happening. The increase in severity, frequency, and duration of wildfires brought on by anthropogenic cli- mate change and rising global temperatures has resulted in the emission of significant amounts of greenhouse gases, the destruction of forests and their related habitats, as well as damage to infrastructure and property (Marlon et al. 2012; Abatzoglou and Williams 2016; Vil `a-Vilardell et al. 2020).

Although these methods may not serve the whole idea of wildfire prediction and prevention, they tend to recognize the fire once it has happened, and the larger it grows, the easier they can segment. Additionally, they have only tried to use traditional rasterized satellite images in which images are patched into traditional RGB 3-channel. Therefore they could not capture very early predictors of small wildfire. An advantage of GOES compared to other satellites is that GOES uses an Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) that takes the image of the Earth with 16 spectral bands (two visi- ble channels, four near-infrared channels, and ten infrared channels) with a fast scan time of 12 slices per hour and a higher resolution of 0.5-2km (Schmit et al. 2017; NOAA 2017b). We can utilize the robustness of ABI images to cre- ate a temporal-like dataset that serves as baseline data for making predictions. For the purpose of synthesizing images, generating adversar- ial networks (GANs) can be taken into account. The network introduces a generator and discriminator for unsupervised adversarial training, which indirectly “learns” the dataset through a minimax game (Goodfellow et al. 2014). The dis- criminator distinguishes genuine pictures from a training set from synthetic phony ones created by the generator. Starting from this idea, we can evolve to generating video frames instead of a single image. This idea can be classified as stochastic video prediction. However, it is a daunting task as most approaches are usually based on image-autoregressive models (Babaeizadeh et al. 2017; Denton and Fergus 2018; Weissenborn, T ¨ackstr ¨om, and Uszkoreit 2019), which were pixel-wise tackles built around Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) where each generated frame is fed back into the model to produce the next frame. The performance of this approach, however, relies heavily on the capability of its en- coders and decoders, as each generated frame has to be re- encoded in a latent space. Such techniques may have nega- tive impact on performance and have limited application, es- pecially when dealing with massive amounts of data (Gregor et al. 2018; Rubanova, Chen, and Duvenaud 2019).Another technique is to separate the dynamic of the state representations from the produced frames, which are de- coded separately from the latent space. This becomes computationally interesting when combined with a low- dimensional latent space and eliminating the relationship mentioned above between frame generation and temporal dynamics.
