An increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r e). The smaller droplet size leads to brighter, more expansive, and longer lasting clouds that reﬂect more incoming sunlight, thus cooling the earth. Globally, aerosol-cloud interactions cool the Earth, however the strength of the effect is heterogeneous over different meteorological regimes. Understanding how aerosol-cloud interactions evolve as a function of the local environment can help us better understand sources of error in our Earth system models, which currently fail to reproduce the observed relationships. In this work we use recent non-linear, causal machine learning methods to study the heterogeneous effects of aerosols on cloud droplet radius. \u0003Equal contribution.

Theoretically, if you hold the liquid water content of a cloud constant, an increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r e). These smaller droplets increase the brightness of the cloud [ 38] and delay pre- cipitation formation [ 3]. The resulting brighter, larger, and longer lasting cloud reﬂects more incoming solar radiation thus cooling the earth. The IPCC 6th report estimates an increase in the magnitude of cooling due to aerosol-cloud interactions compared to the 5th report, without any improvement to the conﬁdence level [ 27]. Aerosol-cloud interactions, and in particular the adjustments due to the delay in precipitation on cloud amount and liquid water content, remain a large source of uncertainty in future climate projections of global warming. Globally, aerosol-cloud interactions work to cool the Earth, however the strength of the effect is heterogeneous. One source of heterogeneity is modulation by local meteorology [ 2,35,9,13]. Understanding how the local environment inﬂuences aerosol-cloud interactions can help us improve our Earth system model parameterizations of these effects and outcomes. In this work we use recent non-linear causal machine learning methods [ 4,20] to study the heterogeneous effects of aerosols on cloud droplet radius. 2 Background 2.1 Meteorological Inﬂuence on Aerosol-Cloud Interactions Aerosol-cloud interactions can be labelled as a heterogeneous effect, as their sign and magnitude is modulated by a cloud’s local meteorology. The local meteorology confounds the estimated effect size as it impacts both the properties of the cloud as well as the aerosol conditions in the cloud’s environment. The relationships between the local meteorology, cloud properties, and aerosol are illustrated in Figure 1. Cloud properties (in red) are dependent on the amount of suitable aerosol (a, light purple) that potentially can be activated as cloud condensation nuclei (increasing Nd, light red); activation itself is dependent on the level of supersaturation within a cloud and the size, shape, and type of aerosol (S, light blue). Supersaturation itself cannot be directly observed using satellites and is dependent on other similarly unobserved meteorological variables like the temperature and pressure proﬁles within a cloud [ 23]. For these hidden variables (T, p, and S), we can rely on indirect diagnostics such as estimated inversion strength (EIS), sea surface temperature (SST), upper level convergence/divergence (w500), and relative humidities at 700 and 850 mb (RHx) (dark blue) to approximate their effects on aerosol (a). The dependence on indirect diagnostics underscores how evaluating relationships between aerosol and observed cloud properties, without accounting for confounders, is fundamentally ﬂawed. Furthermore, we do not have a direct way of observing the amount of aerosol in the atmosphere or the number of cloud condensation nuclei within a cloud, instead relying on aerosol optical depth (AOD), an indirect measure of the amount of aerosol in a column of atmosphere. However, aerosol optical depth is subject to hygroscopic growth, or swelling in the presence of high humidity environments such as near cloud edges [ 10],\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
