Consequences include improved economics for residential PV-storage systems and mitigation of distribution systems’ operational challenges associated with high PV penetration. Keywords: Online Convex Learning, Residential Energy Management Systems, Energy Arbitrage, Peak Shaving 1 Introduction A wide range of Energy management systems (EMS) methods are proposed for residential solar photovoltaic (PV) and battery storage systems (BSS) [1]–[6]. Shared among these methods is the need for time series forecasting, proprietary solvers or inference engines, and a sizeable need for historical operational data ([7]). Such requirements are typically challenging to satisfy in the residential systems, suppressing these methods’ practical implementation [8]. Motivated by these gaps, this paper leverages online convex learning to propose momentum-optimized smart control (MOS), a low-complexity data-driven method that is sample-efficient, does not rely on time series prediction, and is ideal for ensemble or hybrid implementations. MOS outperforms classical optimization methods that rely on a persistence-based forecasting system. The method increases the investment rate of return of residential PV-BSS by increasing the efficiency of planning and operation, leading to an increased share of clean energy in the residential sector. In addition, more effective BSS operation mitigates the distribution systems’ challenges associated with the increased share of residential PV. 2 Problem Statement For many jurisdictions and within the foreseeable future, residential PV-BSS EMS will likely remain focused on local applications that do not require coordination among these systems. This limitation is due to the extensive need for communication infrastructure, the lack of proper regulation and incentive mechanisms, and the requirement for Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI) [7], [8]. ∗Personal page: https://mfarrokhabadi.github.io/index.html Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.Consequently, the two primary applications for these systems are self-consumption maximization (SCM) and time-of-use arbitrage (TA) ([9]).
