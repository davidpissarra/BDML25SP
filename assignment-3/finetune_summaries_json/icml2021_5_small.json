To handle large- scale calibration of digital twins without exorbi- tant simulations, we propose ANP-BBO: a scal- able and parallelizable batch-wise Bayesian op- timization (BBO) methodology that leverages at- tentive neural processes (ANPs). 1. Motivation Buildings account for nearly 40% of global electricity use (over 70% in the U.S.) and at least one third of CO2emis- sions, while space cooling speciﬁcally plays a prominent role as it represents more than 70% of peak residential elec- tricity demand to cope with extreme weather. Forecasts indicate that the demand for space cooling will continue rapid growth, with the energy consumed by these appli- cations projected to triple between 2016 and 2050 (Birol, 2018). Current efforts to reduce the climate-related im- pact of this energy consumption are focused on the cre- ation of grid-interactive buildings, which coordinate the dynamic behavior of buildings with electrical grid behav- ior that is dominated by time-varying distributed energy resources (Satchwell et al., 2021). As the design and control of these buildings represent a signiﬁcant change in how buildings are operated, new models that accurately pre- dict their experimentally-observed dynamics, the so-called building ‘digital twins’, are crucial to developing these next- 1Mitsubishi Electric Research Laboratories (MERL), Cam- bridge, MA, USA..

Building and heating, ventilation, and cooling (HV AC) digi- tal twins need to be calibrated to operational data to accu- rately replicate the observed behavior of the physical system. Physics-informed dynamical models have a number of ad- vantages in digital twin applications, as they have good predictive/extrapolation properties, their parameters are in- terpretable by domain experts, and they can be built using information that is measured or archived. Unfortunately, these advantages are often accompanied by nonlinear behav- ior and numerical stiffness that make simulation sluggish, and the models often comprise translucent/opaque compo- nents for privacy or proprietary information security. The ensuing calibration problem therefore tends to be black- box and large, because modern digital twins often contain hundreds or thousands of parameters to be calibrated. Ma- chine learning has been identiﬁed as a key technology in optimizing building models (Rolnick et al., 2019). This calibration problem can be abstracted by considering a predictive simulation model y0:T=MT(\u0012); (1) where\u00122\u0002\u001aRn\u0012denotes the constant parameters used to parameterize the building and HV AC dynamics. A search domain of parameters \u0002is assumed to be available, and we assume \u0002is a box inn\u0012-space deﬁned by bounded intervals. The output vector y0:T2Rny\u0002Tdenotes the outputs that have been measured using the real building sensors over a time-span [0;T]. We do not make any assumptions on the underlying mathematical structure of the model MT(\u0012), ex- cept that it has been designed based on building and HV AC physics, implying that the parameters and outputs are inter- pretable physical quantities. Simulating MT(\u0012)forward with a set of parameters \u00122\u0002yields a vector of outputs y0:T:=\u0002y0y1\u0001\u0001\u0001yt\u0001\u0001\u0001yT\u0003, withyt2Rny.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nDuring simulations, we propose ANP-BBO, a scalable and parallelizable batch-wise Bayesian optimization methodology that leverages attentive neural processes (ANPs) to handle large-scale calibration of digital twins without extensive simulations.\n\nBuildings account for nearly 40% of global electricity use (over 70% in the U.S.) and at least one-third of CO2 emissions. Space cooling plays a prominent role, representing more than 70% of peak residential electricity demand to cope with extreme weather.

The design and control of these buildings represent a significant change in how buildings are operated, requiring new models that accurately predict their experimentally observed dynamics, known as building \"digital twins.\"\n\nBuilding and heating, ventilation, and cooling (HVAC) digital twins need to be calibrated to operational data to accurately replicate the observed behavior of the physical system. Physics-informed dynamical models have several advantages in digital twin applications, including good predictive and extrapolation properties, interpretable parameters, and the ability to be built using measured or archived information.

Machine learning has been identified as a key technology in optimizing building models. This calibration problem can be abstracted as a predictive simulation model y0:T = MT(\u0012), where \u0012 is a constant parameter used to parameterize the building and HVAC dynamics.\n\nA search domain of parameters \u0002 is assumed to be available, and we assume \u0002 is a box in \u0012-space defined by bounded intervals. The output vector y0:T denotes the outputs that have been measured using real building sensors over a time-span [0;T].

For example, building thermal and refrigerant cycle dynamics can be represented by differential algebraic equations (DAEs) of the form 0 = fDAE( _x; x; u; \u00121) and y = hDAE(x; u; \u00122).\n\nThe calibration task is to estimate a parameter set \u0012? that minimizes (in some goodness-of-fit sense) the modeling error y? 0:T - MT(\u0012?). To this end, we propose optimizing a calibration cost function J(y? 0:T; MT(\u0012?)) to obtain the optimal parameters \u0012? = arg min \u00122\u0002 J(y? 0:T; MT(\u0012?))."
