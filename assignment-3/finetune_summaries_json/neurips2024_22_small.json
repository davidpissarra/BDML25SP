Within this intersection, the electrification of mobility via large-scale deployment of electric vehicles (EVs) is one of the potential tools to decarbonize mobility in the coming decades[1, 15]. This push, however, requires significant investment in power infrastructure, mainly on the distribution level operated by distribution system operators (DSOs)[ 5,4]. This is due to the need to expand the ∗Alternative email: marek.miltner@cvut.cz Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.availability of not only private but also public charging infrastructure, which can help better distribute loads across space and time[6, 13]. Since power engineering infrastructure expansion is an effort requiring significant time and financial resources, a critical challenge in this area is how to optimize grid expansion for efficiency to cover anticipated EV charging demand in various areas while not overloading the current network and not overspending on areas where demand is not as high[ 11,14]. This is especially difficult for DSOs since there has been a general lack of studies demonstrating analysis of real-world EV charging data in different geographies, mainly due to the data being vendor-locked and treated as confidential[2, 10, 11]. In this study, we aim to fill this critical gap by collaborating with PREdistribuce, the DSO in Prague, and the largest operator of public EV chargers. We propose a method to generatively create anticipated EV charging load curves based on location characteristics even in places where no chargers are present, in order to allow for DSOs and the wider community to better understand and simulate public EV charging behavior. 2 Generative modeling of public charging demand In order to solve the challenge of predicting charging profiles for selected locations with limited information, we first analyzed the information about the landscape of public chargers in Prague. Our study is based on data sourced from public EV chargers operated by PREdistribuce, the DSO in the Prague area. We have gotten access to full logs of all charging sessions, including precise start and end times, power consumption, type and power output of each charger, and their location. State of charge or identification of individual vehicles was not available to us. We have paired this information with other geographic and demographic data to complement our understanding of the individual charger locations, based around the basic administrative units the chargers are located in. The public EV charging landscape is further explored in Appendix A. 2.1 Model inputs For the generative predictions of load curves, we have assessed several factors that might come into play to affect charging loads[ 11]. In connection to the basic administrative units, we were able to include several attributes that, in our opinion, are able to increase the performance of our model, including the area character and the amounts of local and long-haul commuters. Firstly, to reflect the character of the surrounding area, we include the basic administrative unit type, which includes 12 distinct categories ranging from residential to industrial. Secondly, to reflect local commuting, we include population density per the administrative unit and the local number of addresses, including industrial and commercial buildings, per the corresponding basic administrative unit. Thirdly, we have further enhanced this data to include information on vehicles commuting to the wider area of town to reflect long-haul commuting factors. In connection to the charging data, we have performed additional analysis of charging load data, uncovering insights that may be found in Appendix B 2.2 Model architecture There are two distinct, yet related components that DSOs are interested in, the first being peak power demand and the second being the actual load shape during the day [ 9,7].
