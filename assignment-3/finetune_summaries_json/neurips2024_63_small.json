We leverage multiple input signals, such as satellite imagery, time-series of deforestation indices and scalar measures, to create a single deep learning model that is both interpretable and accurate. We employ a novel dataset with millions of annotated images of the Brazilian Amazon to train our model, as well as class activation mappings to investigate the added value of interpretability in this context. 1 Introduction Destroying the Amazon rainforest contributes to the global climate crisis by releasing vast amounts of CO2into the atmosphere [ 4]. It also disrupts rainfall patterns, leading to lower agricultural revenues [7]. Understanding the driving forces behind deforestation and precisely quantifying its impacts is important for designing effective public policies. Furthermore, advances in data acquisition and processing, as well as deforestation algorithms, have enabled several initiatives to track deforestation in the Amazon. For example, Instituto do Meio Ambiente e do Homem (Imazon) is an NGO that uses both algorithms and human experts to track deforestation in the Amazon, while the Global Forest Watch project [ 5] employs real-time algorithm to study and visualize deforestation around the world in near real-time. Many governments also provide their own estimates of deforestation rates, such as Brazil’s PRODES [13] and DETER [3]. Imazon’s Deforestation Alert System is a particularly accurate source of deforestation data in the Amazon rainforest. This system utilizes change detection algorithms on top of satellite imagery, as well as human supervision, to detect deforestation. It then generates monthly reports analyzing areas affected by illegal fires and other forms of forest degradation. These reports are publicly accessible and play a vital role in combating illegal deforestation and highlighting current trends, which can then be acted upon by local governments. Their pipeline can be briefly described as follows. Each month, the Normalized Difference Fraction Index (NDFI) indicator [ 11] is calculated pixelwise across the entire Amazon rainforest using Copernicus Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery. The results are then compared with those from the previous month, and areas showing significant divergence are flagged for further inspection. A team of expert analysts manually reviews these areas, determining whether they represent deforestation events. To make these determinations, various data sources are utilized, including Copernicus Sentinel-2, Landsat 8 and 9 imagery, and occasionally Copernicus Sentinel-1 radar. In spite of this, tracking deforestation is a challenging and error-prone task. The primary challenge lies in the extensive cloud cover — which is estimated to obscure at least 70% of the Amazon rainforest at any given time — that interfere with satellite readings. Additionally, seasonal events like Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.floods and receding vegetation over rocky outcrops can create ambiguous situations where vegetation appears to be missing compared to the previous month, despite no deforestation having taken place. The difficulty is compounded by the low resolution of satellite images (10 meters per pixel at best) and the relatively small size of the monthly deforested areas, most of which cover only a few hundred square meters. These factors make deforestation detection highly complex and subjective, further highlighting the importance of auditable and interpretable results. In this work, we describe ongoing efforts to automate the process outlined above through interpretable machine learning algorithms. We utilize a dataset containing hundreds of thousands of manually annotated samples to train several classification networks aimed at detecting deforestation in near real-time. Beyond simply classifying samples, we strive to create a tool that provides insights into the reasons behind the model classifications. To achieve this, we combine images, capturing geographical features, with time series data, reflecting seasonal events, in a compound model. The result is a model with great accuracy and interpretable results. In the following sections, we detail the organization of our dataset and the data processing methods employed; discuss the models used and their training procedures; subsequently, present our results and offer an interpretation of the models’ behavior; and, finally, we conclude with our findings and outline next steps in this research. Related work. Several works focus on deforestation detection, or more generally computing land cover change detection with satellite signals. They range from projects with worldwide scope, such as the full featured monitoring tool Global Forest Watch [ 5], large datasets as [ 12]; to specialized studies that focus on high quality, expert labeled datasets, of a single or few biome(s), as in ForestNet [ 6], that managed to successfully classify driving agents of deforestation on Indonesian tropical forests. The adopted techniques also vary significantly, and include per-pixel applications of pseudo-inverse matrices, known in the remote sensing literature as spectral unmixing, such as the NDFI (2005) [11] and the LCCD [ 1] indexes; traditional ML algorithms, such as random forests in [ 10]; and deep learning models, as in the aforementioned ForestNet architecture.
