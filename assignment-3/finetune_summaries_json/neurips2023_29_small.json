Many of these used ML methods with very high numbers of 5  parameters, such as neural networks, which are the focus of the discussion here. 6  Not much attention has been given to the performance of these methods for 7  extreme event severities of relevance for many critical weather and climate 8  prediction applications, with return periods of more than a few years. This leaves 9  a lot of uncertainty about the usefulness of these methods, particularly for general 10  purpose prediction systems that must perform reliably in extreme situations. ML 11  models may be expected to struggle to predict extremes due to there usually being 12  few samples of such events. However, there are some studies that do indicate that 13  ML models can have reasonable skill for extreme weather, and that it is not 14  hopeless to use them in situations requiring extrapolation. This paper  reviews 15  these studies, updating an earlier review,  and argues that this is an area that needs 16  researching more. Ways to get a better understanding of how well ML models 17  perform at predicting extreme weather events are discussed.  18    This paper is based on and updated from  Watson (2022)  [1]. Key updates are  summarized in sec. 2.1.   1 Introduction  19  It has been shown that machine learning (ML) can perform well at making predictions for events 20  of typical intensities  for tasks such as short -term and seasonal weather forecasting e.g. [2] –[6], 21  downscaling simulations to higher resolution [7]–[10] and emulating and speeding up expensive 22  model parameterisations e.g. [11], [12]. However, evaluation of the performance of these methods 23  for extreme event s is relatively neglected. This paper discusses the need for improving 24  understanding of how ML methods perform in extreme situations, relevant results from the small 25  number of studies that have evaluated this to date, and approaches that can be used in  future work 26  to accelerate progress.  This is relevant for addressing climate change as predictions of changes in 27  extreme event severities are required to inform mitigation and adaptation, and identifying ML 28  methods that perform well for this will help to speed up advances.  29  The lack of evaluation on extreme events  leaves a lot of uncertainty about the usefulness of these 30  methods, particularly for general purpose prediction systems that must perform reliably in extreme 31  situations. ML models may be expected to struggle to predict extremes due to there usually being 32  few samples of such events. However, as will be discussed below, there are some studies that do 33      2 indicate that ML models can have reasonable skill for extreme weather, and that it is not hopeless 34  to use them in situations requiring extrapolation. This makes it an area worth researching more.  35  Some clarity is needed about the use of the term “extreme”. One useful metric to represent the 36  degree to which an event is extreme is the return period, the average time between events with a 37  magnitude at least as large as for the event in question. A large number of studies use the term 38  “extreme” to describe events around the 90 -99th percentile of daily data, which correspond to only 39  a 10-100 day return period. It is indeed useful to assess the performance of ML models around 40  such thresholds. However, these are far from event severities that are relevant to many 41  applications of weather and climate models, and studies typically do not demonstrate how their 42  methods would perform in these cases.  43  At the high end of the scale, events with return periods in the thousands of years are sometimes 44  studied in extreme event attribution (e.g. [13], [14] ) and in the hundreds of years for designing 45  infrastructure for flood and drought resilience (e.g. [15], [16] ). In weather forecasting, the Met 46  Office’s most severe “red” weather warning was issued once every few years per event type in the 47  system’s first decade [17]. The return period at individual locations that were most affected by 48  these events will have been substantially higher. Forecast reliability will also need to be assured 49  for even more extreme events. In keeping with these examples, in the rest of this article “extreme” 50  is used to refer to events with return periods of more than a few years.  51  It seems likely that for ML -based systems to be considered for use in operational weather and 52  climate prediction systems, good performance in extreme situations needs to be shown. This 53  should include events going beyond what is used for training systems, since it cannot be known in 54 \".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
