The OFO is building both a database of geospatial forest data as well as open-source methods and tools for forest mapping by un- crewed aerial vehicle. Such data are useful for a variety of climate applications including prioritizing reforestation efforts, informing wildfire hazard reduction, and monitoring carbon sequestration. In the current iteration of the OFO’s for- est map database, 3D tree maps are created using classical structure-from-motion techniques. This approach is prone to artifacts, lacks detail, and has particular difficulty on the forest floor where the input data (overhead imagery) has lim- ited visibility. These reconstruction errors can potentially propagate to the down- stream scientific tasks (e.g. a wildfire simulation.) Advances in 3D reconstruction, including methods like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), produce higher quality results that are more robust to sparse views and support data-driven priors. We explore ways to incorporate NeRFs into the OFO dataset, outline future work to support even more state-of-the-art 3D vision models, and describe the importance of high-quality 3D reconstructions for forestry applications. 1 I NTRODUCTION Figure 1: A rendered view of a NeRF created from drone-captured forest imagery.The Open Forest Observatory (OFO) is an open source software and data repository created in a joint effort by UC Davis, University of Ari- zona, and CU Boulder to facilitate drone-based forest mapping for forest ecology and manage- ment applications. The dataset in development includes drone-derived 2D photos and videos of forests, photogrammetry-derived 2D and 3D forest maps (Young et al., 2022), and field- based tree geolocation and species classifica- tion information, among other forest data. Currently, the 3D forest models in the OFO are created using structure-from-motion (SfM) (Schonberger & Frahm, 2016), a classical pho- togrammetry technique. SfM uses keypoints in images to reconstruct a point-cloud and depth maps that can then be processed into a 3D mesh. It is not designed to synthesize photo-realistic novel views in the absence of complete data and the meshing approaches often obscure fine detail that can be useful in semantic classification. 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Several recent advances in 3D reconstruction have been made to ameliorate these problems, how- ever little study has been made on applications to forest data, especially for scientific applications, which have different thresholds for acceptable error. The OFO has partnered with computer vision researchers to explore translating state-of-the-art computer vision models to this vital application area. This effort is on-going and in this paper we report on its progress and introduce the OFO dataset to the AI community to encourage further collaboration. Specifically we explore Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) (Mildenhall et al., 2021) as applied to forest mapping. We use NeRF to improve the reconstruction quality in the OFO. NeRFs have been shown to have much higher reconstruction quality and are able to fill in novel views (Yu et al., 2021). In our experiments, we show that NeRF is not only better at creating a more photorealisitic 3D scene, it also produces a higher quality mesh. Photorealism has benefits beyond aesthetics. Understanding density and biomass in a forest are essential to tasks such as estimation of fuel for wildfires and car- bon sequestration. While estimating these quantities requires some 3D understanding of the world, it does not necessarily require an exact 3D geometry. There are many qualitative measurements that are currently only done by sending an expert to physically walk through a forest to estimate things like fuel density or tree spacing. A sufficiently high quality visual experience could facilitate virtual remote qualitative assessments by experts. Such renderings could even enable neural networks to eventually augment or conceivably replace these human assessments. Further validation and bench- marking could allow for quantitative assessments as well, for example counting trees and estimating volumes. Contributions: In this paper, we introduce the Open Forest Observatory, demonstrate qualitative visual improvement (e.g. clearer tree structure, trunks, and leaves) with NeRF on forest data leading to greater opportunity for virtual qualitative assessment, and outline the various extensions of this technology that can further transform the way forests are managed. 2 B ACKGROUND Forest Mapping: Forest inventories are critical resources for understanding ecological processes and informing forest management, but they have traditionally required time-consuming ground- based surveys. Individual tree-level measurements including location, height, stem diameter, health status, and species identity require substantial time and effort to obtain. Advances in drone and imagery processing technology are enabling a new era of forest research in which individual trees can be mapped, measured, and identified to genus or species across broad areas without extensive ground surveys\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
