Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are well-suited to such a problem due to their ability to implicitly learn the distribution of data in high-dimensional settings. We employ a GAN to model the dependence structure for daily maximum wind speed, significant wave height, and total precipitation over the Bay of Bengal, combining this with traditional extreme value theory for controlled extrapolation of the tails. Once trained, the model can be used to efficiently generate thousands of realistic compound hazard events, which can inform climate risk assessments for climate adaptation and disaster preparedness. The method developed is flexible and transferable to other multivariate and spatial climate datasets. 1 Introduction Compound events, defined as combinations of climate variables, not all of which are necessarily extreme, but which lead to extreme impacts [1], can wreak far greater damages than those composed of a single driver [2]. Most major recent climate catastrophes, such as droughts caused by low precipitation and high temperatures; and coastal flooding caused by co-occurring high tides, heavy precipitation, and strong onshore winds, were compound events. Univariate risk assessments have been shown to significantly underestimate true hazard levels [2]. Additionally, hazard maps which assume spatially-homogeneous return periods are physically unrealistic and lead to inaccurate risk assessments [3]. For successful climate adaptation policies to be developed it is paramount that scientists develop accurate and efficient methods to model the spatial distributions of compound hazard events. There are two classical approaches for modelling the distribution of multivariate extreme events: copulas [4, 5] and the multivariate conditional exceedence model [6]. Both approaches decompose the problem into modelling the univariate marginals and the dependence structure between them. Here, marginal refers to the probability distribution of a single hazard at a point in space. Copulas are based on Sklar’s theorem [7] and accurate modelling relies on choosing the most appropriate copula family. The multivariate conditional exceedance model replaces the copula with a semiparametric Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.conditional model that learns the conditional distribution of all the marginals, given that one of them is extreme, and introduces flexibility into the asymptotic dependence structure between pairs of variables. Both methods rely on parameter estimation, hence inference becomes computationally inefficient as dimensionality increases. Machine learning is increasingly being used to address the shortcomings of traditional approaches in multivariate extreme modelling. Letizia and Tonello [8] developed a fully nonparametric model using two separate GANs to capture both the marginal distributions and the dependence structures. Bhatia, Jain, and Hooi [9] developed ExGAN, which generates samples of desired extremeness levels for rainfall data over the United States using a conditional GAN. Boulaguiem et al. [10] combined extreme value theory with deep convolutional GANs (DCGANs) to generate annual maximum precipitation and temperature fields over Europe, training a separate, single-channel model for each of the two variables. We develop an extension on the work of Boulaguiem et al. [10] to the multi-dimensional case by simultaneously training a DCGAN on three channels of gridded climate data: wind speed, significant wave height, and total precipitation. By training on daily maxima rather than annual maxima, we capture the propensity for extremes to co-occur on a given day. We present preliminary results and demonstrate that the model generates physically realistic samples that capture the dependence structure across space and between variables. Such a model can be used to efficiently generate a large synthetic ensemble of multivariate events, addressing the urgent need for better modelling of compound events in climate risk assessment [2]. 2 Methodology Data Hourly wind speeds [ms-1], significant height of combined wind waves and swell [m], and total precipitation [m] for the years 2013-2022 are obtained from the ERA5 hourly data on single levels from 1940 to present reanalysis product [11]. The data has 0.25◦spatial resolution. We obtain the data over the Bay of Bengal (longitude: 10-25◦East, latitude: 80-95◦North) and calculate the daily maxima. We resize the images to 18×22pixels using bilinear interpolation and zero-pad them to20×24pixels. Normalisation It is conventional to normalise data before training a neural network, to stabilise gradient descent and improve convergence. Boulaguiem et al. [10] propose to replace standard re-scaling methods with the probability integral transform [12, 13], where each observation Xj∈R is replaced by its empirical distribution function ˆFX(Xj), which follows a uniform distribution over the interval [0,1]. This effectively separates the dependence structure from the marginal distributions. The neural network is then trained on the uniform-transformed data.
