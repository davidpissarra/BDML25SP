However, such modeling is very challenging at scale due to the high computational costs of existing numerical methods. This challenge leads to significant uncertainty in evaluating storage opportunities which can delay the pace of global CCS de- ployments. We introduce a machine-learning approach for dynamic basin-scale modeling that speeds up flow prediction nearly 700,000 times compared to exist- ing methods. Our framework, Nested Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), provides a general-purpose simulator alternative under diverse reservoir conditions, geo- logical heterogeneity, and injection schemes. It enables unprecedented real-time high-fidelity modeling to support decision-making in basin-scale CCS projects. 1 I NTRODUCTION Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is an important climate change mitigation technology that cap- tures carbon dioxide (CO 2) and permanently stores it in subsurface geological formations. It pro- vides a tangible solution for decarbonizing hard-to-mitigate sectors and can generate negative emis- sions when combined with direct air capture or bioenergy technologies (Pathways, 2019; Luderer et al., 2018; Fankhauser et al., 2022). However, the current pace of CCS deployment scale-up has failed to meet expectations (Reiner, 2016). One of the critical challenges contributing to the delay is the uncertainties in storage prospects and injection capacities (Lane et al., 2021). The geological storage of CO 2leads to pressure buildup and gaseous plume migration in the storage formation (NAS, 2018). Forecasts of these dynamic responses are used to determine CO 2storage capacities and guide important engineering decisions. The modeling of these processes requires multi-phase (Pruess et al., 1999; Blunt, 2017), multi-physics (Pruess & Garcia, 2002), and multi- scale simulations, which are very expensive with current numerical approaches. As a result, they are inadequate to provide rigorous computation supports that are needed for accelerating CCS project deployments around the world (Lane et al., 2021). An especially challenging characteristic of CO 2storage modeling is that it demands both high- resolutions and extremely large spatial-temporal domains. The CO 2plume and near-well pressure buildup require highly resolved grids (Pruess & M ¨uller, 2009; Andr ´e et al., 2014; Doughty, 2010; Wen & Benson, 2019). Meanwhile, pressure buildup can travel hundreds of kilometers beyond the ∗Corresponding author: gegewen@stanford.edu 1CO2plume and interfere with other injection operations (Chadwick et al., 2004). Due to these multi- scale responses, many CCS-related analyses are forced to use inaccurate simulations with coarsened grid resolution (Kou et al., 2022) and/or simplified physics (Cavanagh & Ringrose, 2011). One approach for reducing the computational costs of numerical simulations is to use non-uniform grids to capture different responses with different resolutions. A popular method, known as local grid refinement (Bramble et al., 1988) (LGR), has enabled simulations of real-world three-dimensional (3D) CO 2storage projects, where the fine-grid responses capture the plume migration while the coarser grid responses capture the far-field pressure buildup (Eigestad et al., 2009; Faigle et al., 2014; Kamashev & Amanbek, 2021). However, even with non-uniform grid approaches, these numerical models are still too expensive to be used for important CCS tasks that require probabilistic/repetitive forward stimulation such as site selection (Callas et al., 2022), optimization (Nghiem et al., 2010; Zhang & Agarwal, 2012), and inversion (Strandli et al., 2014).
