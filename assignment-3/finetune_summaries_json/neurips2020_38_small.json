To mitigate such unequal reach of climate change, a solution is to alleviate the reliance on numerical models (and by extension groundstation data) by enabling machine-learning-based global forecasts from satellite imagery. Though prior works exist in regional precipitation nowcasting, there lacks work in global, medium-term precipitation forecasting. Importantly, a common, accessible baseline for meaningful comparison is absent. In this work, we present RainBench, a multi-modal benchmark dataset dedicated to advancing global precipitation forecasting. We establish baseline tasks and release PyRain, a data-handling pipeline to enable efﬁcient processing of decades- worth of data by any modeling framework. Whilst our work serves as a basis for a new chapter on global precipitation forecast from satellite imagery, the greater promise lies in the community joining forces to use our released datasets and tools in developing machine learning approaches to tackle this important challenge. 1 Introduction Extreme precipitation events, such as violent rain and hail storms, can devastate crop ﬁelds and disrupt harvests [ 22,12]. Although these events can be locally forecasted with sophisticated numerical weather models that rely on extensive ground and satellite observations, such approaches require access to compute and data resources that developing countries in need – particularly in South America and West Africa – cannot afford [ 11,5]. The lack of advance planning for precipitation events impedes socioeconomic development and ultimately affects the livelihoods of millions around the world. Given the increase in global precipitation and extreme precipitation events driven by climate change [6], the need for accurate precipitation forecasts is ever more pressing. To mitigate such unequal reach of climate change, a solution is to alleviate the reliance on numerical models (and by extension ground-station data) by enabling machine-learning-based forecasts from global satellite imagery. Several notable prior works exist in applying machine learning techniques to precipitation forecasting. Early work by Xingjian et al. [ 24] proposed a convolutional recurrent neural \u0003Equal contributions. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning Workshop at NeurIPS 2020.network for precipitation nowcasting. Most recently, Sønderby et al. [ 21] from Google proposed a “(weather)-model-free\" approach, MetNet, which forecasts precipitation in continental USA using geostationary satellite images and radar measurements as inputs. This approach performs well up to 7-8 hours, but inevitably runs into a forecast horizon limit as information from global or surrounding geographic areas is not incorporated into the system. Such short time windows do not enable substantial disaster preparedness for disadvantaged populations. Moreover, there lacks a common and accessible dataset for meaningful comparison in global precipitation forecasting research. Most related to our work, Rasp et al. [17] developed WeatherBench, a benchmark suite for global data-driven medium-range weather forecasting. Although WeatherBench forms an excellent ﬁrst step in weather forecasting (focusing on temperature and geopotential), it falls short at enabling precipitation forecasts. First, WeatherBench does not include any observational raw data (e.g. satellite imagery) and only contains ERA5 precipitation data, which has limited skill in representing extreme precipitation events. Further, WeatherBench does not include a fast dataloading pipeline to train ML models, which has been found to be a signiﬁcant bottleneck in our model development. In this work, we present RainBench, a multi-modal benchmark dataset dedicated to advancing global precipitation forecasting. We establish baseline end-to-end forecasting tasks covering realistic data conditions. Together with the release of an efﬁcient data-handling pipeline, PyRain, we are hopeful that this work will facilitate future machine learning research in tackling the important challenge of precipitation forecasting. 2 RainBench We introduce RainBench a dataset to facilitate research efforts into global precipitation forecasting from satellite imagery. RainBench results from the combination of the following sources of data. SimSat. We integrate Simulated Satellite (SimSat) data to minimize data processing requirements and to simplify the prediction task. SimSat data is model-simulated satellite data generated from Euro- pean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECWMF)’s high-resolution weather-forecasting model using the RTTOV radiative transfer model [ 20]. Simsat emulates three spectral channels from the Meteosat-10 SEVIRI satellite [ 1]. Simsat provides information about global cloud cover and moisture features and has a native spatial resolution of about 0:1°– i.e. about 10 km – at three-hourly intervals. The product is available from April 2016 to present (with a lag time of 24 h). Using real satellite data adds unnecessary complication which deviates from the core precipitation forecasting problem (e.g. the need to account for instrument error and missing values) and is left as future work. IMERG. We use Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals (IMERG), a global half-hourly precipitation estimation product provided by NASA [ 8].
