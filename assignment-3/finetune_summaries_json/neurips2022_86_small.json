The complex transport and retention mechanisms of ENPs hinder the development of an efﬁcient remediation strategy. Therefore, a predictive tool for understanding the transport and retention behavior of ENPs is highly required.

The result from the forward model demonstrates the effective capability of dw-PINN in accurately predicting the ENPs mobility. The model veriﬁcation step shows that the relative mean square error (MSE) of the predicted ENPs concen- tration using dw-PINN converges to a minimum value of 1:3e\u00005. In the subsequent step, the result from the inverse model estimates the governing parameters of ENPs mobility with reasonable accuracy.

The widespread presence of contamination in aquifers poses a great threat to the human health, environmental quality and socioeconomic development[2], [3]. Furthermore, the groundwater quality is intricately linked to the climate change. On one hand, the persistence of groundwater pollution can lead to the degradation of soil quality[4], forestry[5] and even coastal ecosystem[6]; thus accelerating the climate change processes. Conversely, the climate change can intensify the fresh water demands, and enhance sea water intrusion[7]. With the escalating industrial activities in the past decades, implementation of groundwater remediation techniques has become critical in controlling the water quality. Several remediation techniques have been developed in the literature for the restoration of groundwater resources[8]–[10]. In the recent years, injection of ENPs in a contaminated aquifer has proven to be highly efﬁcient in the groundwater remediation[11], [12]. While extensive research has been done in developing and testing these ENPs at laboratory scale, their ﬁeld scale injection for groundwater remediation is still limited[10]. The limitation of ENPs application is attributed to its highly complex Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.transport and retention behavior which is often difﬁcult to predict. While several numerical and data-driven tools have been proposed in the literature for predicting the behavior of ENPs, their application is often challenged by data sparsity and heterogeneity in hydrogeological parameters[13]. A Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) can overcome these challenges by embedding the knowledge of governing equations into the learning method of a neural network[14], [15]. However, the application of PINNs in the subsurface ﬂow and transport is still rare and have been only limited to contaminant mobility[13], [15]. To our best of knowledge, this paper is the ﬁrst to implement Physics-Informed Neural Network for simulation of ENPs mobility in a saturated sand. While there are several advantages of using PINN model, the gradient imbalance problem reduces its accuracy[16], [17]. To overcome this problem, [13] proposed dynamic weight strategy for PINN (dw-PINN) where PINN is modiﬁed by assigning dynamically updated weights for the balance of loss function. The dynamic weight adaption has been highly effective in solving ﬂow and transport related equations and therefore in this research work, the model is developed with dw-PINN. With this method, this research study aims to provide a robust predictive tool for bridging the gap between laboratory testing of ENPs and its ﬁeld implementation.
