Second, it understands that data are the ﬁnal arbiter of any simulation or model; this favors the use of data-driven approaches and analysis. Finally, it accepts that some ecological systems are too complex yet to be formulated in mathematical or programmatic terms. Depicting ecology as a ﬁeld in which mathematical and data-driven modeling do not interact much, and instead the research work develops separately, Levin ( 1) suggested that ecology should move towards combining them. Subsequently, the development of statistical models ( 7) and numerical approaches ( 3) based on multivariate statistics have shown some ability to explain data. However, this combination yields models that very rarely do give new predictions. One of the reasons is that current empirical and experimental research is often lacking in integration of multiple ecosystem compartment interactions: most project-based analysis is restricted to well-established system boundaries, current paradigms and hypotheses based thereon. Even if this approach has moved forward the scientiﬁc knowledge on the functioning of individual ecosystem compartments, it has strong limitations as shown by the current in-ability of models to predict whole ecosystem carbon balances. Consequently, despite decades of research, scientists still struggle to accurately determine the scale of future carbon export ( 2) essential information to understand how climate change will affect Arctic and Subarctic ecosystems. Key questions such as \"How much carbon will Arctic emit under future climate conditions?\" and \"How do the multitude of ecosystem processes, driven by plant activities and growth, microbial activities and soil characteristics, interact to determine soil carbon storage capacity?\" remain unanswered. Colin Prentice, leading climate researcher of the Imperial College of London, worded it in a provocative but also a confronting way: Our current ecosystem-climate interaction models are better at predicting the past than the future. In this paper, we present the Future Arctic initiative ( http://www.futurearctic.be ), a multi- disciplinary training network where machine learning researchers and ecologists study jointly the effects of climate change in Iceland. 2. Experimental Evidences: the ForHot site The ForHot site ( www.forhot.is ) in Iceland offers a geothermally-controlled soil temperature warming gradient, where Subarctic ecosystem processes are affected by temperature increases as expected through climate change ( 6).

The site consists of two different zones: a long-term zone, which is known to be exposed to such heats for centuries and a short-term zone, which has only been heated up to 8 years, due to a recent earthquake. This availability of a large range of temperature gradients, at multiple time scales, is unique in the world, as they enable studying both long- and short-term responses to future climate change now.
