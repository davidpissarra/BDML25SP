For this purpose, we combine a fully convolutional neural network with a convolutional long short-term memory. Implementation details of the proposed spatio-temporal neural network architecture are described. Examples are provided for the monitoring of roads and mangrove forests on the West African coast. 1 Introduction Land cover can be deﬁned as the physical features that cover the land, such as trees or pavement. A similar notion is land use that can be deﬁned as human management and activities on land, such as mining or recreation. Climate can affect and be affected by changes in land cover. A forest, for instance, would likely include tree cover but could also include areas of recent tree removals currently covered by open grass areas. Land cover and use are inherently coupled: changes in land-use practices can change land cover, and land cover enables speciﬁc land uses. Changes in land cover can occur in response to both human and climate drivers. Therefore understanding how land cover, use, condition, and management vary in space and time is important to analyze vulnerable areas that are threatened by the ongoing climatic and anthropogenic global changes. With a low topography, a weak geological substratum, a poor fresh water supply, and a dense and rapidly expanding population, some littoral areas such as the West African coast for example are highly vulnerable to current sea level rise, extreme climatic phenomena, erosion, and modiﬁcations of the ecosystems and resources. Many Earth observation programs such as Landsat, Sentinel, SPOT and Pleiades produce huge volume of medium to high resolution multispectral images every day that can be organized in time series and used to produce accurate and up-to-date land cover and use maps that can monitor environmental changes at different places and time ranges. In the past few years, Deep learning (DL), a class of machine learning algorithms that uses multiple layers to progressively extract higher level features from complex data, has gained attention. Deep learning architectures, especially Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) show a great potential for application to various remote sensing problems such as land cover and use mapping. However, even if FCNs deal very well with spatial representation of features within an image, they are unable to learn the additional information provided by the multi-temporal structure of time series images, which can improve the land cover classiﬁcation accuracy and efﬁciency. In addition, when applied on a single image, they lead systematically to a variance, that depends on the day when the image was acquired. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.To capture the temporal dependency of images, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a class of deep learning architectures where connections between nodes form a directed graph along a temporal sequence, can be used. For example, (G. Sumbul, B. Demir, 2019) present a novel multi-attention driven system that jointly exploits Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and RNNs in the context of multi-label remote sensing image classiﬁcation. The article (Stoian et al., 2019) proposes a framework for working with Sentinel-2 L2A time-series image data, and an adaptation of the U-Net model for dealing with sparse annotation data while maintaining high resolution output. In (C. Pelletier et al., 2019), an analysis of RNN and Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNNs) for the classiﬁcation of Sentinel-2 image time series is provided. In (Emmanuel Maggiori, 2017), RNNs are used to correct satellite image classiﬁcation maps. In this work, we exploit both temporal and spatial information provided by multi-temporal Sentinel-2 images to generate accurate and up-to-date land cover and use maps. For this purpose, we combine a FCN with a RNN. 2 METHODOLOGY Our acrhitecture combines a FCN that captures the spatial representation of features in the image with a RNN that learns the temporal variations of these features. The architecture of our FCN is based on the U-Net. It is a symmetric encoder-decoder structure consisting of a contracting branch that captures the context and an expanding branch that enables precise localization for the segmentation masks. The contracting path consists of the repeated application of two 3 \u00023 convolutions, each followed by a ReLu and a 2\u00022max pooling for downsampling. At each downsampling step, the number of feature channels is doubled. Every step in the expansive path consists of a transpose convolution that halves the number of feature channels, a concatenation with the corresponding feature map from the contracting path and one 3x3 convolution. This FCN enables us to generate a Probability Map (PMap) from an input image. The PMap is an image of the same size as the input but withlcchannels,\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
