This Special Report on Renewable Energy Sources and Climate Change Mitigation (SRREN) impartially assesses the scientiﬁ  c liter ature on the  potential role of renewable energy in the mitigation of climate change for policymakers, the private sector, academic researche rs and civil society.  It covers six renewable energy sources – bioenergy, direct solar energy, geothermal energy, hydropower, ocean energy and wind e nergy – as well  as their integration into present and future energy systems. It considers the environmental and social consequences associated with the deployment  of these technologies, and presents strategies to overcome technical as well as non-technical obstacles to their application an d diffusion. The  authors also compare the levelized cost of energy from renewable energy sources to recent non-renewable energy costs. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the leading international body for the assessment of climate change. It  was established  by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) to provide the world with a clear  scientiﬁ  c view on the current state of knowledge on climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts.Renewable Energy Sources and Climate  Change Mitigation Special Report of the Intergovernmental  Panel on Climate Change Edited by Ramón Pichs Madruga Co-Chair Working Group III Centro de Investigaciones de la  Economía Mundial (CIEM)Ottmar Edenhofer Co-Chair Working Group III Potsdam Institute for Climate  Impact Research (PIK)Youba Sokona Co-Chair Working Group III African Climate Policy Centre,  United Nations Economic  Commission for Africa (UNECA) Kristin Seyboth Patrick EickemeierPatrick Matschoss Gerrit HansenSusanne Kadner Steffen SchlömerTimm Zwickel Christoph von Stechow Technical Support Unit Working Group III Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY PRESS Cambridge, New York, Melbourne, Madrid, Cape Town,Singapore, São Paulo, Delhi, Tokyo, Mexico City Cambridge University Press 32 Avenue of the Americas, New York, NY 10013-2473, USA www.cambridge.org Information on this title: www.cambridge.org/9781107607101 © Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change 2012This publication is in copyright.
