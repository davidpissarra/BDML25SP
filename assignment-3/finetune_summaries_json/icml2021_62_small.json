Introduction The number and devastating impacts of natural disasters have grown signiﬁcantly worldwide. The latest report re- leased by Munich Re (2020) states that natural disasters such as hurricanes, ﬂoods, and other disasters caused more than $210 billion estimated damage worldwide, while $95 billion of the damage occurred in the US. According to the same report, summer ﬂoods in China were the costliest natu- ral disaster worldwide in 2020, and the number of fatalities in ﬂoods was higher than other natural disasters (Munich Re, 2020). Recent studies show that the frequency and impact of ﬂooding increases in certain regions as a result of climate change (Davenport et al., 2021; The National Centers for Environmental Information, 2021; Tabari, 2020) due to an increase in sea level (Strauss et al., 2016) and frequency of extreme precipitation (Diffenbaugh et al., 2017), or inten- sifying hurricane rainfall (Trenberth et al., 2018). Thus, it is crucial to predict streamﬂow and, consequently, ﬂooding to mitigate its devastating effects in terms of damage and fatalities. 1IIHR—Hydroscience & Engineering, The University of Iowa, Iowa City, Iowa, USA.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICML 2021Many physical and data-driven methods have been proposed to achieve accurate streamﬂow predictions, and recent stud- ies show that deep learning models often provide more accu- rate results than physical-based models (Gauch et al., 2019; Xiang & Demir, 2020; Xiang et al., 2021). Recurrent neural networks based approaches are mainly used for the task as a result of the success of these architectures on time series problems (Sit & Demir, 2019). (Hu et al., 2018) proposed a Long short-term memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter & Schmidhu- ber, 1997) model that predicts the hourly streamﬂow from 1 to 6 hours lead time. (Kratzert et al., 2018) developed another LSTM model that predicts daily runoff for the ﬁrst time. (Xiang & Demir, 2020) developed a model that uses multiple GRUs (Cho et al., 2014) and Time-distributed lay- ers in order to predict up to 120 hours of streamﬂow. Many studies aim to predict streamﬂow based on various data such as evapotranspiration, current streamﬂow, or weather data. More detailed information about deep learning studies on streamﬂow prediction can be found in (Sit et al., 2020). Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and variants including Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs), or Graph Recurrent Networks (GRNs) have gained much attention as a result of their performance on many deep learning tasks comprising sequenced data points which can be expressed as a graph (Wu et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020). For instance, (Seo et al., 2018) pro- poses a convolutional recurrent neural network architecture that captures spatial dependencies with CNNs and iden- tiﬁes dynamic patterns with GRUs in the structured data sequences by showing two use cases; predicting moving MNIST data and modeling natural language with the Penn Treebank dataset. (Bai et al., 2020) uses a graph convolu- tional recurrent network with two new modules that allow to learn node-speciﬁc patterns and discover spatial correla- tions from data separately for a trafﬁc prediction task. Based on successful implementations of GNNs on structured se- quences, in this paper, we present a model based on Graph Convolutional GRUs for streamﬂow prediction that we will refer to as StreamGConvGRU. Furthermore, we show our preliminary results for StreamGConvGRU using real-world data for a small network of streamﬂow sensors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst work that presents at least some preliminary results for streamﬂow prediction usingShort-term Hourly Streamﬂow Prediction with Graph Convolutional GRU Networks Graph Neural Networks. 2.

Introduction\n\nThe number and devastating impacts of natural disasters have grown significantly worldwide. According to a recent report by Munich Re (2020), natural disasters such as hurricanes, floods, and other disasters caused more than $210 billion in estimated damage worldwide, with $95 billion of the damage occurring in the US. Summer floods in China were the costliest natural disaster worldwide in 2020, and the number of fatalities in floods was higher than other natural disasters (Munich Re, 2020). Recent studies show that the frequency and impact of flooding increase in certain regions due to climate change (Davenport et al., 2021; The National Centers for Environmental Information, 2021; Tabari, 2020) due to an increase in sea level (Strauss et al., 2016) and frequency of extreme precipitation (Diffenbaugh et al., 2017), or intensifying hurricane rainfall (Trenberth et al., 2018). It is crucial to predict streamflow and, consequently, flooding to mitigate its devastating effects in terms of damage and fatalities.\n\nTackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICML 2021\n\nMany physical and data-driven methods have been proposed to achieve accurate streamflow predictions, and recent studies show that deep learning models often provide more accurate results than physical-based models (Gauch et al., 2019; Xiang & Demir, 2020; Xiang et al., 2021).
