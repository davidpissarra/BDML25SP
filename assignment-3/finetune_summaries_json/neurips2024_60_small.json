To enable efficient and reliable simulation of extreme weather events, it is crucial to achieve rapid turnaround, dynamical consistency, and accurate spatio- temporal spectral recovery. We propose an efficient correction diffusion model, TAUDiff, that combines a deterministic spatio-temporal model for mean field downscaling with a smaller generative diffusion model for recovering the fine-scale stochastic features. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach on downscaling atmospheric wind velocity fields obtained from coarse GCM simulations. Our approach can not only ensure quicker simulation of extreme events but also reduce overall carbon footprint due to low inference times. 1 Introduction Weather extremes are on the rise due to accelerated climate change [ 1]. Given their potential to severely damage life and property, it is becoming increasingly important to estimate their frequency, associated risks and economic losses beforehand [ 2–4]. By insuring for such losses, we can become more resilient towards extreme events [ 5]. Climate risk modeling often relies on historical Earth system observations [ 6] or physics-based general circulation models (GCMs) [ 7] to generate climate projections. Typically, GCMs operate at a coarse resolution ( O(10)−O(102)km) due to compute limitations. This leads to incorrect characterization of weather extremes. In recent years, machine- learning based statistical downscaling approaches have been explored to obtain realistic well-resolved climate data over specific regions [ 8–10]. These methods leverage historical Earth system observation data to create a non-linear mapping from bias-corrected coarse GCM simulations to the desired higher-resolution outputs. While deterministic regression models effectively capture large-scale features, they struggle with fine-scale stochastic atmospheric processes due to low-frequency spectral bias [ 11]. This limitation has recently led to the adoption of generative models like GANs [ 10,12,13], and denoising diffusion models for downscaling tasks [ 14,15]. Denoising diffusion models [ 16–18] are particularly promising due to their stability in training, reliable convergence, and high output quality. However, sampling is often time consuming. Addressing this, Karras et al. [19] explored the design space of such diffusion Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.models, and proposed the elucidated diffusion model (EDM) which successfully reduced the number of model evaluations (from O(103)toO(10)) required to generate a single sample. Motivated by this, a correction diffusion model (CorrDiff) [ 14] was proposed for kilometer-scale downscaling. CorrDiff combined a UNet-based deterministic model to map the mean field and an EDM correction to capture fine-scale stochastic content. In the context of extreme-event simulation, it is vital that both short- and long-term event statistics of downscaled data be consistent with historical observations. So, the lack of temporal model- ing in downscaling models may affect dynamical consistency of downscaled data (e.g. distorted propagation of storm fronts). One could address this issue by borrowing techniques from video generation/prediction [ 20], as explored by Yoon et al. [21] for regional weather forecasting. However, such techniques have not yet been explored for downscaling. Moreover, large models as in [ 14] are computationally intensive to train and infer. This prohibits the generation of even relatively small (O(103)) extreme-event datasets, which are crucial for accurately quantifying climate tail risk. Given a good mean-field model, it is possible that a smaller and computationally efficient diffusion model would suffice. This would reduce overall computational demands, inference times, and improve efficiency for real-time use. To address these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient Temporal Attention Unit en- hanced Diffusion model (TAUDiff) that integrates (a) a video prediction model for dynamically consistent mean-field downscaling, and (b) a smaller guided denoising diffusion model for stochasti- cally generating the fine-scale features. We train the models on atmospheric wind fields obtained from reanalysis dataset. The performance of TAUDiff is first compared against separate mean-field regression and end-to-end diffusion models under a fixed training budget. Finally, we evaluate the downscaling performance of TAUDiff on an ensemble of bias-corrected coarse GCM outputs using various spectral statistics. We finally discuss its potential in producing accurate and computationally efficient extreme-event datasets, and the implications of model inference times and carbon footprint offsetting. 2 Methods Overview We demonstrate the efficacy of TAUDiff in downscaling atmospheric wind fields over the European region. For our training, we use the atmospheric reanalysis dataset (ERA5) at 0.25◦lat-lon resolution produced by the European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) [ 6].
