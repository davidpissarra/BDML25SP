This provides a challenge for AI- based approaches to long-term ﬁre risk modeling, as much future ﬁre risk is outside of the available feature space provided by the historical record. Here, I give an overview of this problem that is inherent to many cli- mate change impacts and propose a restricted model form that makes monotonic and interpretable predic- tions in novel ﬁre weather environments. I then show how my model outperforms other neural networks and logistic regression models when making predictions on unseen data from a decade into the future. Introduction One way to describe the future effects of climate change is with the phrase global weirding. The 21st century will be in- creasingly uncanny, as we will see Caribbean beach weather in Iceland; deserts that become soggy and green; and an Arc- tic Ocean that is entirely free of ice, potentially by 2035 (Guarino et al. 2020). Novel assemblages of temperature, precipitation, land cover, and vegetation will emerge that are unlike anything in human history, giving rise to hazards un- precedented in severity and posing major challenges to adap- tation. Additionally, these weird conditions are a challenge to any form of modeling that depends on rich training data, as much of the future will be entirely outside of the feature space of available observational data. This is especially true in the case of wildﬁre, because ﬁre depends on two things: burnable vegetation and dry enough conditions to ignite that vegetation. Under stable climate conditions, weather and vegetation reach an equilibrium, where the amount of burnable vegetation is proportional to the amount of rainfall (See Fig. 1). However, under climate change, we are seeing increasingly novel pairings of pre- cipitation and vegetation (See Fig. 2). For example, Califor- Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artiﬁcial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

However, in the past decade, California had weather condi- tions more characteristic of a desert climate. This extremely dry weather, coupled with high levels of vegetation, is what has caused the unprecedented ﬁre crisis in California (Abat- zoglou and Williams 2016). A similar situation is occurring in the Amazon, where tropical rainforest vegetation is expe- riencing increasingly long dry seasons and is converting into a tropical savanna, with ﬁre consuming the excess biomass (Le Roux et al. 2022). These emerging conditions are causing signiﬁcant prob- lems for sectors like the insurance industry, which has traditionally used historic risk to estimate future risk and appropriately price premiums. Unable to accurately esti- mate ﬁre risk under unprecedented conditions, many home insurance companies are withdrawing from ﬁre-prone ar- eas, leaving homeowners without coverage (Poizner 2022; Singh 2022). Given that a typical home mortgage can last up to 30 years, a period over which climatological and eco- logical systems will continue to disequilibrate, it is impera- tive that we develop better methods for estimating ﬁre risk that can make reasonable predictions outside of the existing feature space provided by historic data. Data For this analysis, I use data on ﬁre occurrence provided glob- ally and at a 500 meter resolution derived from NASA’s MODIS satellite program (Giglio et al. 2009). This dataset goes back to November 2000 and provides a binary indica- tor of whether a ﬁre was observed at a given pixel at a daily timestep. From this dataset, I collected 240 million sample locations on a given day across the terrestrial world, over- sampling ﬁre occurrence to make up approximately 10% of the dataset, but otherwise sampling completely at random. For each sample point, I calculate a daily ﬁre weather in- dex known as the Keetch-Byram Drought Index, or KBDI (Brown, Wang, and Feng 2021; Gannon and Steinberg 2021). KBDI is an index updated on a daily time step and is indicative of the amount of water in the top 203 millimeters of soil. A KBDI score of 0 corresponds to saturated soil and very little ﬁre risk, while a KBDI score of 203 indicates that soil is dry up to 203 millimeters deep and that ﬁre risk is very high. To calculate historic values of this index, I use dailyFigure 1: Historically, precipitation and biomass have been in equilibrium.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nHistorically, it has been observed that climate change poses a challenge for long-term fire risk modeling using AI-based approaches. Much of the future fire risk is outside the available feature space provided by the historical record. This paper provides an overview of this problem and proposes a restricted model form that makes monotonic and interpretable predictions in novel fire weather environments. The model is then shown to outperform other neural networks and logistic regression models when making predictions on unseen data from a decade into the future.\n\nOne way to describe the future effects of climate change is the concept of \"global weirding.\" The 21st century will be increasingly unusual, with novel combinations of temperature, precipitation, land cover, and vegetation emerging that are unlike anything in human history. These conditions pose significant challenges to adaptation and are a challenge to any form of modeling that depends on rich training data, as much of the future will be outside the feature space of available observational data.\n\nWildfires depend on two key factors: burnable vegetation and dry enough conditions to ignite that vegetation.
