Spatial clustering approaches can construct the necessary structure after surveys have occurred, but more work is needed to ensure that they are effective for this purpose. In this proposal, we describe the role of spatial cluster- ing for realizing the potential of large biodiver- sity datasets, how existing methods approach this problem, and ideas for future work. 1. Introduction Species distribution models (SDMs) are critical tools for mitigating the impact of climate change on biodiversity. SDMs link environmental variables to species observations to infer key characteristics of habitat requirements and to predict where species can persist. As ecosystems change, scientists and natural resource managers rely on SDMs to inform conservation policy decisions like designing reserves for threatened species and to predict how species will react to global change. Our ability to effectively protect species against extinction relies on high-quality SDMs. This tool can be built from a variety of biodiversity datasets, but community science programs like eBird and iNaturalist are growing in size, quality, and importance.

These crowdsourced datasets present exciting opportunities to understand the Earth’s changing ecosystems at scales previously unattainable, but further methodological research is needed to fully leverage their potential. In this proposal, we outline the role that spatial clustering algorithms can play in improving SDMs built with community science data. Community science data are impacted by imperfect detec- tion: the common phenomenon in which observers do not detect all individuals and/or species present during a survey. Even expert observers encounter this issue—sometimes, birds are silent and hidden, for example—but community scientists with less training are even more impacted. Im- perfect detection functions as class conditional noise in the view of SDMs as a classiﬁcation problem, where positive examples have little to no noise and negative examples may reﬂect substantial corruption (Hutchinson et al., 2017). To account for imperfect detection, studies conducted by ex- perts use a careful sampling design that allows them to simultaneously estimate the probability that a species occu- pies a location and the probability that the observer detects the species given that it is present. This methodology is referred to as occupancy modeling, and it has become the dominant approach in statistical ecology for correcting the effects of imperfect detection (MacKenzie et al., 2002; Bai- ley et al., 2014). Ignoring imperfect detection can lead to biased estimates of species distributions, so occupancy mod- els are a necessary tool for drawing accurate conclusions from biodiversity data (Guillera-Arroita et al., 2014; Lahoz- Monfort et al., 2014). Our focal problem in this paper is the fact that community science data are not collected accord- ing to the sampling design prescribed by occupancy models. Instead, contributors report observations at the times and places of their choosing. We present the ﬁrst attempt to frame the challenge of cre- ating sites for occupancy models from unstructured com- munity science data as a spatial clustering problem, which we introduce as the Site Clustering Problem. Below, we examine existing methods that at least partially address the problem and explore some spatial clustering approaches to solve it in a case study. We illustrate where this researchSpatial Clustering for SDMs Figure 1. The proposed Site Clustering Problem (in red) lies on the critical path to informing action on biodiversity conservation. lies on the critical path that begins at data collection and ends with climate change mitigation (Figure 1). Improved solutions to this problem will produce more accurate mod- els and have direct impacts to biodiversity conservation and natural resource planning. 2. Background Occupancy models rely on a few key assumptions to cor- rect for imperfect detection. They expect that data consist of multiple observations collected at each of a set of sites. Theclosure assumption states that the occupancy status of the species remains constant across the observations at a site. For example, a site could be a section of a state park surveyed along three different transects, and the occupancy model would assume that the entire section (site) was either occupied or unoccupied, even if the observations from the transects vary. Classic occupancy models also assume no false positives ; that is, observers may miss the species, but positive reports are reliable. These assumptions in tandem allow the probability of detection to be estimated. In our example, if the three observations were [0;1;0], it is implied that this site is occupied, and the detection probability is1 3.
