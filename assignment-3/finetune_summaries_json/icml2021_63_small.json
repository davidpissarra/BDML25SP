We combine the meth- ods being developed in computer vision with geostationary satellite imagery to identify wildﬁre smoke plumes in near real-time, providing a method to improve analysis with more accurate identiﬁcation of smoke and potentially extend anal- ysis beyond the US. Researchers have applied machine learning techniques to related problems with mixed results. Speciﬁcally, Wan et al. (2011) used unsupervised learning approaches to clus- ter smoke in RGB color images using both a sharpening and mixture model approach (Wan et al., 2011). Their ex- ploratory results showed that it was possible to identify smoke plumes by analyzing satellite imagery, but the un- supervised approach limited opportunities to examine the out-of-sample performance of the models. Wolters and Dean present two approaches to smoke segmentation by combining labeled hyperspectral images with logistic re- gression models (Wolters & Dean, 2015; 2017). Their more recent work illustrates the ability of auto-logistic regression models to capture the spatial association between neigh- boring pixels, which allows for smoothing over predictions. However, while the results are positive, the model’s error rates are still relatively high. More recent literature illustrates the potential of using neu- ral networks to estimate local pollution levels (Li et al., 2017; Hong et al., 2019). Similarly, researchers have de- signed custom neural network architectures for classifying different classes of aerosol including smoke, but the classiﬁ- cation does not isolate and segment plumes, which makes it challenging to quantify the contribution wildﬁre smoke versus other sources of aerosol in downstream analysis (Ba et al., 2019).

Introduction\n\nSince the early 1980s, scientists at the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service (NESDIS) have explored the use of environmental satellites to detect fires while other researchers identified the potential of using satellite imagery for wildﬁre smoke detection (McNamara et al., 2004; Chung & Le, 1984; Svejkovsky, 1985).
