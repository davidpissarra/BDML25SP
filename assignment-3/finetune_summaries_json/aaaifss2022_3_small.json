We introduce KnowUREnvironment – a knowl- edge graph for climate change and related environmental is- sues, extracted from the scientific literature. We automatically identify 210,230 domain-specific entities/concepts and en- code how these concepts are interrelated with 411,860RDF triples backed up with evidence from the literature, without using any supervision or human intervention. Human evalu- ation shows our extracted triples are syntactically and factu- ally correct ( 81.69% syntactic correctness and 75.85% preci- sion). The proposed framework can be easily extended to any domain that can benefit from such a knowledge graph. 1 Introduction Both misinformation and lack of information can be harmful when it comes to climate change. Misinformation can create confusion about crucial socio-political issues and makes it difficult for people to comprehend the true scenario. At the same time, a lack of knowledge about climate change and re- lated environmental issues makes people underestimate the problem. Many people lack motivation for appropriate ac- tion (Joshi and Rahman 2015); many even deny that climate change is happening (Dunlap, McCright et al. 2011). The scenario can be improved by equipping the general public with accessible information. A relevant, appropriate knowl- edge graph can help people easily comprehend facts and connect different concepts, which eventually helps generate new forms of knowledge. Also, knowledge graphs have been frequently used to improve the performance and explainabil- ity of several downstream AI applications. One important application is automated fact-checking, where a statement is converted to a semantic graph and later compared against an existing knowledge graph to check for logical consis- tency (Gallagher 2006; Vedula and Parthasarathy 2021). Knowledge graphs are also extensively used for informa- tion retrieval, recommender systems, and question answer- Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org).

Amazon introduced a product graph (Dong 2018) that improves prod- uct search and recommendation while consumers shop on- line. IBM Watson (Gliozzo et al. 2013) which defeated hu- man experts in question answering, uses several knowledge bases as its source of information. Structured representation of knowledge also plays a vital role in chatbots and vir- tual assistants (e.g., Siri). Unlike deep-learning-based mod- els lacking interpretability, knowledge graph-based models are explainable. Several domains have benefitted from having a domain- specific knowledge graph. KnowEdu (Chen et al. 2018) is a knowledge graph for education that captures mathematical concepts and visualizes them as a graph, facilitating learn- ing and scientific discovery. Knowledge graph for biomedi- cal engineering is a hot topic, and has been applied for drug discovery (Sang et al. 2018; Zeng et al. 2022) and predict- ing disease co-morbidity (Biswas, Mitra, and Rao 2019). A knowledge graph for climate change can reduce misinfor- mation on social media by using automated fact-checking. Such a knowledge graph can raise public awareness by au- tomatically answering questions related to climate change, and help knowledge discovery and causal inference by find- ing relevant concepts in the knowledge graph. It can also enable recommendation systems to suggest more sustain- able content (e.g., showing more eco-friendly products on e-commerce websites based on consumer preference (Islam et al. 2022)). Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, a knowledge graph focusing on climate change and related issues is not publicly available. In this paper, we present KnowUREnvironment – a knowledge graph focusing on climate change and environ- mental issues, constructed automatically in an unsupervised manner. We use Resource Descriptor Framework (RDF) triples to represent our knowledge graph, where each triple consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. Subjects and objects are nodes of the knowledge graph, often re- ferred to as entities/concepts. Predicates are directed edges capturing the relationship between the subject and the ob- ject. As shown in Figure 1, “automobile” and “emission” are two nodes of the knowledge graph, where the “source” predicate denote their relationship that “automobile mayFigure 1: A snapshot of KnowUREnvironment depicts how ‘automobile’ could be related to climate change and related issues. Within a few hops, the graph can connect concepts from diverse yet relevant fields like environment, agriculture, and public health demonstrating how powerful yet so compact a knowledge graph can be. Additionally, each of the links in the graph is backed up by a scientific evidence. source emission\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
