To combat this, Integrated Pest Management (IPM) stands as a climate-smart alternative. Despite its potential, IPM faces low adoption rates due to farmers’ skepticism about its effectiveness. To address this challenge, we introduce an advanced data analysis framework tailored to enhance IPM adoption. Our framework provides i) robust pest population predictions across diverse environments with invariant and causal learning, ii) interpretable pest presence predictions using transparent models, iii) actionable advice through counterfactual explanations for in-season IPM interventions, iv) field-specific treatment effect estimations, and v) assessments of the effectiveness of our advice using causal inference. By incorporating these features, our framework aims to alleviate skepticism and encourage wider adoption of IPM practices among farmers. 1 Introduction Conventional pest management has been shown to contribute to climate change. Raising temperatures, intensifying ultraviolet radiation, and reducing relative humidity, are expected to increase pest outbreaks and undermine the efficacy of pest control methods like host-plant resistance, bio-pesticides, and synthetic pesticides [ 37,41]. Pervasive pesticide use in agriculture, despite climate experts’ warnings, adversely affects public health [ 9] and contributes to the climate crisis. This impact includes: i) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from pesticide production, packaging, and transportation [ 6], ii) compromised soil carbon sequestration [ 48], iii) elevated GHG emissions from soil [ 27,18,42], and iv) contamination of adjacent soil and water ecosystems, resulting in biodiversity loss [35]. Thus, a vicious cycle has been established between pesticides and climate change [36]. In response, the European Commission (EC) has taken action for the reduce of all chemical and high-risk pesticides by 50% by 2030. Achieving such reductions requires adopting integrated pest management (IPM), which promotes sustainable agriculture and agroecology. IPM consists of 8 principles inspired by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) description. The authors in [8] condense these principles ∗Equal contribution. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.into prevention and suppression, monitoring, decision-making, non-chemical methods, pesticide selection, reduced pesticide use, anti-resistance strategies, and evaluation. Data-driven methods have played a crucial role in optimizing pest management decisions. Some employ supervised machine learning (e.g., Random Forests, Neural Networks) with satellite Earth observations (EO) and in-situ data for pest presence prediction [ 49,4], some incorporating weather data [ 40]. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are used to capture temporal features from weather data, effectively handling unobservable counterfactual outcomes [ 47]. Filho et al. extract fine-scale IPM information from meteorological data, insect scouting, remote sensing and machine learning [21]. Nanushi et al. propose an interpretable machine learning solution for Helicoverpa armigera presence in cotton fields [30], enhancing IPM decision-making beyond traditional thresholds. 2 Proposal As Barzman et al. point out, threshold-based and \"spray/don’t spray\" advice is not enough [ 8]. There is a need for a new class of digital tools that take into account the entire set of IPM principles in order to truly enhance decision-making. In this direction, we propose a data analysis framework for IPM based on causality and explainability. It consists of short-term actionable advice for in-season interventions and long-term advice for supporting strategic farm planning (Figure 1). This way, we will upgrade the monitoring anddecision-making IPM principles leading to actionable advice for direct pest control interventions and assist the selection of practices relevant to other IPM principles, such as use non-chemical methods andreduce pesticide dosage. Additionally, the proposed framework will better inform farmers with respect to the potential impact of practices that, in turn, will enhance the IPM principle of prevention and suppression, e.g., crop rotation, day of sowing, and no-tillage. Furthermore, our framework employs observational causal inference to continuously assess the aforementioned recommendations and thereby satisfy the IPM principle of evaluation.
