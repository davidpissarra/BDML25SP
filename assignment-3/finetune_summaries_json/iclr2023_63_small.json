Zigler Department of Statistics and Data Sciences The University of Texas at Austin Austin, TX, USA cory.zigler@austin.utexas.edu ABSTRACT The climate penalty measures the effects of a changing climate on air quality due to the interaction of pollution with climate factors, independently of future changes in emissions. This work introduces a statistical framework for estimating the climate penalty on soot pollution (PM 2.5), which has been linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and premature mortality. The framework evaluates the disparities in future PM 2.5exposure across racial/ethnic and income groups—an important step towards informing mitigation public health policy and promoting environmental equity in addressing the effects of climate change. The proposed methodology aims to improve existing statistical-based methods for estimating the climate penalty using an expressive and scalable predictive model based on spatial deep learning with spatiotemporal trend estimation. The proposed approach will (1) use higher-resolution climate inputs, which current statistical approaches to es- timate the climate penalty cannot accommodate; (2) integrate additional predictive data sources such as demographics, geology, and land use; (3) consider regional dependencies and synoptic weather patterns influencing PM 2.5, deconvolving the effects of climate change from increasing air quality regulations and other sources of unmeasured spatial heterogeneity. 1 I NTRODUCTION Air pollution is one of the leading mortality risk factors worldwide. In 2019, up to 6.7 million deaths worldwide were attributed to cardiovascular diseases likely caused by air pollution exposure (Mur- ray et al., 2020; Brauer et al., 2021). Particularly concerning is soot pollution from fine particulate matter with a diameter less than 2.5 µm (PM 2.5). These small particles can travel deep into the lungs, and some may even enter the bloodstream (EPA, 2023). Several studies have found signifi- cant evidence that PM 2.5is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular disease (Brook et al., 2010) and premature mortality (Wu et al., 2020; Pelucchi et al., 2009; Laden et al., 2006). Due to its significant public health and economic consequences (Wu et al., 2020), it is crucial to understand how PM 2.5 will be affected by climate change, which is believed to increase air pollution concentrations (East et al., 2022). This effect is known as the climate penalty, and it measures the effects of a changing climate on PM 2.5concentration due to the interaction of pollution with climate factors, indepen- dently of future changes in emission levels (Fiore et al., 2022). Here we introduce a novel statistical framework (summarized in Fig. 1) for estimating the climate penalty allowing us to produce higher- resolution predictions and use more predictors than existing statistical approaches. Our scientific aim is to predict the climate penalty on PM 2.5under a constellation of climate change scenarios and use these projections to evaluate the disparities in future PM 2.5exposure across racial/ethnic and 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2023 Figure 1: Proposed workflow. income groups. The findings have the potential to inform mitigation policy aiming to protect public health and promote environmental equity when addressing the effects of climate change. Accurately characterizing the climate penalty is challenging due to the complex interactions between atmospheric patterns and PM 2.5(Tai et al., 2010). For instance, higher temperatures increase PM 2.5 due to increasing oxidation rates and fire emissions. By contrast, the effect of relative humidity and cloud cover may vary by different PM 2.5components and geographic locations (Tai et al., 2010; Koch et al., 2003). PM 2.5levels are also affected by regional or synoptic weather patterns occurring at a larger spatial scale (Shen et al., 2015; Leung et al., 2018). Thishan Dharshana et al. (2010) estimate that synoptic systems derived from wind patterns such as cold frontal passages and maritime inflow accounted for 30% of the daily variability in PM 2.5in the US. The full effects of synoptic patterns on PM 2.5are still not fully understood, and quantifying them remains an open, challenging task (Shen et al., 2017; Tec et al., 2023). Estimating the climate penalty with chemical transport models (CTMs) has been the subject of much attention within the atmospheric modeling community (Racherla & Adams, 2006; Hong et al., 2019; Val Martin et al., 2015; Fiore et al., 2022; East et al., 2022; Day & Pandis, 2015; Tai et al., 2012; Jacob &\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
