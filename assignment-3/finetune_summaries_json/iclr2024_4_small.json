To overcome this, we introduce the Geo-ViT-LSTM model, a novel approach that enriches LSTM predictions by integrating basin attributes derived from remote sensing with a vision transformer.

Thus, accurate predictive models of streamflow are critical for informed decision-making and effec- tive adaptation strategies. Machine learning (ML) methods, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown considerable promise in streamflow prediction by effectively capturing complex hy- drological processes and modeling temporal dependencies and non-linear relationships (Kratzert et al., 2018; Konapala et al., 2020; Nearing et al., 2021). Recent research indicates that global LSTM models, trained on data from multiple river basins, can predict streamflow more accurately than basin-specific models (Kratzert et al., 2019a). This approach, which integrates sequential meteorological data and static catchment at- tributes like basin size, shape, soil type, and vegetation from diverse basins, is better equipped to handle various conditions, improving predictions in ungauged basins and during extreme events linked to climate change (Frame et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2021; Tayal et al., 2022). The effectiveness of these models in han- dling heterogeneity relies on a detailed understanding of each basin’s attributes, as they critically influence hydrological responses to climatic inputs (Stein et al., 2021; Arsenault et al., 2023). 1This manuscript has been authored by UT-Battelle, LLC, under contract DE-AC05-00OR22725 with the US De- partment of Energy (DOE).

This approach presents several challenges, including high uncertainty due to temporal changes, spatial heterogeneity, measurement errors, and missing data. Furthermore, not all river basins have a complete set of measured characteristics, hindering the development of a comprehensive global model and limiting the transferability of models between regions. Additionally, some crucial basin attributes for modeling streamflow response are often unknown or poorly understood. Addressing these limitations and effectively learning comprehensive basin attributes is vital for accurate streamflow prediction. In this effort, we aim to advance streamflow prediction by enhancing basin attributes using terrain features, land cover, vegetation health, and water body perimeter derived from remote sensing (RS) data. Our premise is that RS can provide comprehensive, dynamic, and spatially complete characteristics across basins. Despite uncertainties in the RS data, their high spatial resolution allows for more precise characterization through machine learning (Shirmard et al., 2022). This enriched set of attributes can improve streamflow predic- tions and facilitate model transferability across different basins based on similarities in these characteristics. To integrate these enhancements, we introduce the Geo-ViT-LSTM approach, which augments the LSTM model by incorporating knowledge from RS via pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) (Zhang et al., 2021; Khan et al., 2022; Zhou et al., 2022), along with existing geomorphological static attributes. This approach leverages ViT to extract spatially informed context from RS data, enhancing the streamflow prediction with additional basin attributes. Geo-ViT-LSTM centers on two main aspects: (1) Multi-modal feature extraction, using ViT to transform RS imagery into spatially aware feature representations, highlighting key terrain, land cover, and vegetation health indicators, and (2) Integrated modeling, wherein the RS features are combined with static attributes and meteorological sequences within the LSTM model.
