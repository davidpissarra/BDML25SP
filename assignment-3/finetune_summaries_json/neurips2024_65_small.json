With the pressing climate goals set and the potential of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a climate-relevant technology, scaling up the number of new plants to over 1000 facilities per year by 2030 becomes imperative. However, such a massive scale-up presents not only technical challenges but also control and regulation issues, ensuring maximal output of plants while conforming to regulatory requirements. In this paper, we present a novel method of optimizing the process of a biochar plant based on machine learning methods. We show how a standard Random Forest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, the physics of which remains highly complex. This model then serves as a surrogate of the machine – reproducing several key outcomes of the machine – in a numerical optimization. This, in turn, could enable us to reduce NOx emissions – a key regulatory goal in that industry – while achieving maximal output still. In a preliminary test our approach shows remarkable results, proves to be applicable on two different machines from different manufacturers, and can be implemented on standard Internet of Things (IoT) devices more generally. 1 Introduction The urgency of addressing climate change has led to a global call for innovative solutions that can effectively mitigate ever-increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) (Anderson & Peters, 2016). In line with this imperative, Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies emerged as a crucial component of the climate action toolkit. CDR encompasses a spectrum of anthropogenic activities aimed at the removal and durable storage of CO2 in geological, terrestrial, or oceanic reservoirs, as well as in various products (Board et al., 2019). This approach holds the potential to not only suppress emissions but also to achieve net-negative CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere, essential for achieving the goal of net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (Smith et al., 2016). As highlighted ∗corresponding author mkoeppphys.ethz.ch Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Sketch of a general continues pyrolysis reactor. The screws (e.g. valve position or ventilator) are the “machine states” (input features), while the sensor symbols (e.g. temperature or NOx) are the target which the Random Forest is predicting given the machine states. Note that the ARTi reactor has multiple champers so this image only shows a very basic design. For a more detailed representation we encounter the reader to visit the websites (PYREG, 2024) and (ARTi, 2024). in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) Working Group III (Shukla et al., 2022), CDR strategies are indispensable, especially for counterbalancing residual emissions that are difficult to eliminate through conventional means (Rogelj et al., 2018). The deployment of CDR solutions, however, comes with its own set of challenges, particularly with respect to feasibility and sustainability constraints, especially at larger scales. As outlined in the IPCC AR6, upscaling CDR deployment necessitates the development of effective approaches, a task that requires innovative technologies and strategies capable of both removing CO2 from the atmosphere and ensuring its long-term storage. Among the array of CDR methods discussed in the report, biochar stands out as a promising yet underexplored avenue. Given the rapid growth in global biochar production from 95,000 metric tons per year in 2021 to 350,000 metric tons per year in 2023 (Initiative, 2023), this trend aligns with climate action goals, positioning Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) as a potentially crucial climate-relevant technology. To meet ambitious climate targets, scaling up the number of new BCR facilities to over 1000 per year by 2030 becomes imperative. The scale-up of BCR facilities, however, brings challenges in terms of operation modes. Most prominent the emission control of the facilities needs to be under control to be possible to operate the machine under the given emission limits. In light of these challenges, this paper seeks to introduce an approach to predict the NOx emissions of BCR plants, which can be seen as the most critical emission limit. Specifically, our focus lies in demonstrating how machine learning algorithms can be harnessed to model the intricate states of highly complex pyrolysis machines, thereby enabling real-time prediction of production values based on the current operational state. With this work, we relate to multiple strands of literature. Several papers use machine learning to model biochar-related processes already, but is primarily interested in yield prediction (Li et al., 2022; Hai et al., 2023). Similarly, in domains other than biochar, machine learning has successfully been used to predict NOx emissions during physical and chemical processes, but remains focused on coal-based power plants (Matsuzaki et al., \".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
