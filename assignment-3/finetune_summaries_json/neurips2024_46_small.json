Our model integrates the Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion partial differential equations (PDEs) and enforces no-slip and zero-flux Neumann boundaries at obstruction surfaces and simulation edges. We used a hybrid learning approach, generating a dataset of 16.1 million colocation points for supervised learning and embedding physical laws into the loss function for unsupervised learning. In our experiments, the PINN was over 2520 times faster than the traditional numerical solvers for 5000 timesteps, delivering results in under 2190 milliseconds and achieving a mean squared error below 3E-5. Our findings demonstrate that PINNs not only offer a drastic reduction in computational time but also scale favorably with both the time domain and spatial resolution, making them a viable solution for real-time pollution monitoring and emergency response planning. Future work will focus on extending our model to dynamic obstructions and arbitrary grid geometries. 1 Introduction Pollution modeling enhances our ability to combat climate change. Scientists rely on pollution models to provide critical data for emissions management [1], climate predictions [2], health protection [3], and sustainable energy planning. Traditionally, pollution simulations use numerical methods, such as the finite element method [ 4], finite difference method, finite volume method, smooth particle hydrodynamics [ 5], and computational fluid dynamics [ 6] to solve PDEs, which are the types of equations seen in physical laws. While these are tried and tested methods, one of the biggest downsides is that they are known to be slow, taking days to run [ 7]. However, with recent advances in Machine Learning, researchers potentially have found a faster alternative to traditional numerical methods [ 8,9,10]. In the past several years, researchers have successfully trained PINNs to solve PDEs [ 11]. The reason PINNs can solve PDEs is that, given a big enough neural network, it is theoretically capable of approximating any continuous function, no matter how complex it may be [12]. Thus, neural networks are a promising technology that can, one day, render traditional numerical methods obsolete [13]. In recent years, there has been a growing number of publications on the use of PINNs to model pollution spread under various conditions. AI researchers at the California Institute of Technology Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.were able to teach a neural network to solve the Navier-Stokes equations within an acceptable error range in comparison to traditional numerical methods. However, this research was limited to solving the Navier-Stokes equations on a continuous grid, without incorporating obstructions [ 14]. In a recent paper [ 15], researchers employed PINNs to model free-surface laminar flows described by the shallow water equations. While they used soft initial conditions, the study faced limitations due to the lack of obstructions and the reliance on open boundaries across the domain. In [ 16], the authors introduce a method to improve the accuracy of solving nonlinear partial differential equations by adaptively focusing on difficult regions in the solution. While this research used soft initial conditions, they did not include any obstructions in the flow domain. Our review of recent publications on PINNs identified a focus on grids with open boundaries and without obstructions. To enable more realistic pollution simulations that account for the spread around obstacles such as buildings and other structures, our research seeks to build on these works by introducing obstructions and incorporating soft initial conditions. Specifically, we will apply no-slip and zero-flux conditions to both the obstruction surfaces and the edges of the simulation environment. Additionally, we will integrate soft initial conditions by allowing the neural network to receive the coordinates of the initial pollution source location as input. This approach will enable us to develop a dynamic model capable of simulating pollution spread from any given source location. 2 Methods 2.1 Governing Equations and Simulation Environment for Pollution Spread The spread of pollution is governed by the Navier-Stokes and advection-diffusion PDEs as shown in (1)-(4). Numerical simulations for pollution spread consist of two general steps: solving for fluid flow using (1)-(3)and advecting the pollutant particles using (4). We model pollution in a 2D 100 x 100 Cartesian grid for timesteps in range t∈[0, 5000], assuming laminar flow throughout. Figure 1, shows the simulation environment with obstructions in white denoted by the Ωsymbol in the left image. We apply no-slip and zero-flux Neumann boundary conditions [ 17] along obstruction surfaces and the edges of the simulation environment to ensure no pollutant flux occurs across boundaries.
