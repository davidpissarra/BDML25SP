This enables grid planners to directly minimize consumption-based emissions, regardless of whether or not the carbon market incorporates a carbon tax. We solve this problem using gradient descent with implicit differentiation, a technique recently popularized in machine learning. To demonstrate the method, we optimize transmission and storage resources on the IEEE 14-bus test network and compare our solution to one generated by standard planning with a carbon tax. Our solution signiﬁcantly reduces emissions for the same levelized cost of electricity. 1 Introduction In order to mitigate the escalating climate crisis, electricity networks must be redesigned to enable increased renewable penetration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This will involve making long-term structural changes to the grid that may drastically inﬂuence day-to-day grid operations. Because electricity grid investments are expensive and infrequent, choosing the right design decisions is a fundamental problem in power systems. Expansion planning is the problem of optimally designing or modifying an infrastructure network to meet demand growth alongside cost and security objectives. In expansion planning problems, a grid planner optimizes structural variables, e.g., power line capacity, to minimize the sum of the investment cost —the cost to modify the network—and the operation cost —the cost to operate the grid given the chosen network variables. The latter is determined by solving the dispatch problem (also called the production cost model), in which electricity generators are dispatched to meet demand at minimal cost while satisfying physical constraints. Traditionally, monetary costs have been the primary focus of expansion planning studies. Although recent studies have introduced emissions-related penalties in the planning objective [ 1,2,3,4], these works only model emissions insofar as how they affect monetary costs via a carbon tax or cap. Importantly, this assumes the underlying dispatch problem uses a carbon tax or cap when dispatching generators, which is often not the case in practice. In contrast, real world grid planners may be tasked Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.with modifying the network to drastically reduce emissions (say, to comply with a state mandate), even if the corresponding dispatch model does not tax or cap emissions. Contribution. We formulate the problem of minimizing a mixture of carbon emissions and mone- tary costs during planning. We solve this problem using gradient descent via implicit differentiation, a popular technique in machine learning for differentiating through optimization problems. We compare our method to planning with a carbon tax on the IEEE 14-bus network, and show that, at the same levelized cost of electricity, emissions are lower when emissions are included in the planning objective rather than through a carbon tax. 1.1 Related work Expansion planning. Expansion planning problems have been a focus of power systems research for several decades [ 5,6]. Much of this research has focused on building better models for electricity grid operation [ 7,8,9,10,11], dealing with uncertainty [ 7,12,13,14], and developing scalable algorithms [ 15,16,17,18,19,20]; see [ 6] for a comprehensive overview. Recently, several papers have considered expansion planning with carbon emissions by incorporating a carbon tax or cap to the electricity market dispatch process [1, 2, 3, 4] or through carbon equity constraints [21]. Implicit differentiation and bi-level optimization. Implicit differentiation is a method for dif- ferentiating the solution map x\u0003(\u0012)of a parameterized system of equations K(x;\u0012) = 0. Implicit differentiation is not new—it goes back at least to Cauchy [ 22]—but has recently been popularized in machine learning [ 23,24,25]. Since any convex optimization problem can also be formulated as solving a system of nonlinear equations, e.g., the KKT conditions, this technique can be used to differentiate through optimization problems. This often occurs in bi-level optimization [ 26,27,28], where an optimization problem is embedded in another problem. In power systems, implicit differen- tiation has recently been used for sensitivity analysis [ 29], network discovery [ 30], and reinforcement learning [24], although applications of the technique can be found at least as far back as [31]. 2 Expansion planning In this section, we describe the expansion planning problem, and its variant with a carbon tax.
