This study introduces a transformer-based model that integrates historical streamflow data with climatic variables to enhance streamflow prediction accuracy. We evaluated our transformer model against a benchmark LSTM across five diverse basins in the United States. Results demonstrate that the transformer architecture consistently outperforms the LSTM model across all evaluation metrics, highlighting its potential as a more effective tool for hydrological forecasting. This research contributes to the ongoing development of advanced AI techniques for improved water resource management and climate change adaptation strategies. 1 Introduction Accurate streamflow prediction is crucial for effective water resource management[ 1], especially in the face of increasing climate variability[ 2][3]. Current approaches to streamflow forecasting, while valuable, face significant limitations[ 4]. Large scale process based hydrologic models like the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC)[ 5] and Precipitation Runoff Modeling System (PRMS)[ 6], provide detailed simulations of the water cycle but are computationally intensive and often struggle to capture the complex, non-linear relationships in hydrological systems[ 7]. Data-driven methods, particularly LSTM networks[ 8], have gained popularity for their ability to model long-term dependen- cies. However, LSTMs can struggle with very long sequences and may not fully capture the intricate temporal dynamics of streamflow patterns for a long-term forecasting[9][10]. Transformer architec- tures, originally developed for natural language processing tasks, offer a promising solution to these challenges[ 11]. Their self-attention mechanism allows for more efficient modeling of long-range dependencies and can potentially capture complex seasonal and inter-annual patterns in streamflow data more effectively than LSTMs[ 12]. Moreover, transformers have shown superior performance in various time series forecasting tasks[ 13], suggesting they could improve streamflow prediction accuracy. In this study, we introduce a transformer-based model, FutureTST, to forecast streamflow up to 30 days ahead across diverse basins in the United States. By leveraging the transformer’s ability to process long sequences and identify subtle patterns, we aim to address the limitations of current physics-based and LSTM models. This research is particularly timely given the increasing hydrological uncertainties brought about by climate change. Improved streamflow forecasting can enhance our ability to manage water resources, mitigate flood and drought risks, and support climate change adaptation strategies. ∗Corresponding author 38th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2024).2 Data description In this research, data was taken from the Catchment Attributes and Meteorology for Large-sample Studies (CAMELS)[ 14] dataset. This dataset consisted of daily precipitation, vapor pressure, maxi- mum temperature, snow water equivalent, short-wave radiation, daylight, and streamflow data from 1980-2014 for over 500 basins in the United States. Data from 1980-2000 was used as training data while data from 2001-2007 was used as validation data, and data from 2008-2014 was used as testing data. To rigorously assess our transformer model’s performance and versatility, we conducted evalua- tions across five diverse basins in the United States (locations were shown in Figure 1). These basins were carefully selected to represent a wide range of hydrometeorological conditions and catchment attributes, allowing us to test the model’s transferability and generalizability. This diverse testing ground enables us to evaluate how well the transformer model adapts to varying climate patterns, land use characteristics, and hydrological regimes. Furthermore, we extended our analysis to multiple forecasting horizons, predicting streamflow at 1-day, 14-day, and 30-day intervals. This multi-horizon approach allows us to assess the model’s capability in both short-term operational forecasting and longer-term water resource planning scenarios. By examining performance across these different temporal scales, we can gauge the transformer’s ability to capture both immediate fluctuations and longer-term trends in streamflow patterns, providing valuable insights into its potential for enhancing both day-to-day water management decisions and longer-term climate adaptation strategies.

Mathematically, this forecasting problem is formulated as yfuture =f(ypast, Xpast, Xfuture ). We use a transformer model, called FutureTST, to address this problem. FutureTST has an encoder-decoder architecture, as shown in Figure 2. First climatic variables, Xpast, Xfuture, are transformed into embeddings through a linear layer. This helps the model understand and identify relationships between climatic variables. These embeddings are then passed through the encoder block. Meanwhile, previous streamflow records, ypast, is broken up into overlapping patches. This helps capture temporal dependencies present within\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
