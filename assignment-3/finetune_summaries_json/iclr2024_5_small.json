By integrating advanced ma- chine learning techniques with detailed environmental data, our approach sig- nificantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of disease prediction in vine- yards. The TabPFN model’s experimental evaluations showcase comparable per- formance to traditional gradient-boosted decision trees, such as XGBoost, Cat- Boost, and LightGBM. The model’s capability to process complex data and pro- vide per-pixel disease-affecting probabilities enables precise, targeted interven- tions, contributing to more sustainable disease management practices. Our find- ings underscore the transformative potential of combining Transformer models with remote sensing data in precision agriculture, offering a scalable solution for improving crop health and productivity while reducing environmental impact. 1 I NTRODUCTION Remote sensing technology, with its integration of multisensor image analysis and climate feature assessment, has become a cornerstone of precision agriculture, particularly in viticulture, where it offers unparalleled advantages in the early detection of diseases. By leveraging multispectral Ferro et al. (2023), thermal imaging technologies Fevgas et al. (2023), and climate data, researchers can monitor the subtle spectral and thermal changes in grapevine foliage-early indicators of phy- topathological stress. These changes, indicative of disease onset, occur before symptoms are vis- ibly detectable, providing a critical window for early intervention. Multisensor imagery captures the vineyard’s detailed spectral profile through various wavelength bands and incorporates climate variables, enriching the analysis with environmental context. This comprehensive approach, when further analyzed with indices such as NDVI and NDWI Zhang et al. (2019), transforms complex datasets into interpretable metrics closely linked to the vines’ health and vitality. Current disease detection methods in viticulture primarily rely on a combination of manual inspec- tions, laboratory analysis, and remote sensing technologies. Researchers focus on utilizing high spatial or spectral resolution images Ferro et al. (2023); Kanaley et al. (2023) to identify vineyard diseases, with a particular emphasis on detecting individual diseases and analyzing information at the pixel level Kerkech et al. (2020). This study explores the benefits of utilizing multi-sensor and multi-scale remote sensing features to predict grapevine diseases at the block level. We highlight the significant advancements made possible by these technologies in promoting vineyard health and productivity. A particular challenge in this field has been the lack of extensive in-situ examples for disease forecasting. The introduction of the TabPFN method Hollmann et al. (2023) marks a substantial improvement in addressing small- scale tabular classification challenges. By integrating the TabPFN model with a block-wise disease database prepared by multi-sensor imagery, we aim to surpass the limitations of current disease detection methods, setting a new standard for accuracy in vineyard disease management. 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 2 M ETHODOLOGY Figure 1: Flowchart of the proposed disease forecasting framework. The TabPFN method Hollmann et al. (2023); Picard & Ahmed (2024) is used as an example. The TabPFN learns to approximate the PPD of a given prior in the offline stage to yield predictions on a new dataset in a single forward pass in the online stage. This workflow (Fig.1) illustrates our method progression from initial data preparation to the eventual unknown data classification. The TabPFN, a Transformer Vaswani et al. (2017) based model which contains 12 layers, is designed for classification tasks on small tabular datasets and trained offline. It learns to approximate the posterior predictive distribution (PPD) of Bayesian inference on synthetic datasets, which are drawn from a specified prior. In the Bayesian framework for supervised learning, the prior defines a space of hypotheses on the relationship of a set of inputs xto the output labels y. The TabPFN is trained once and can make predictions in less than a second without hyperparameter tuning. It accepts training and test samples as input and produces predictions in a single forward pass, making it competitive with state-of-the-art methods while being significantly faster.
