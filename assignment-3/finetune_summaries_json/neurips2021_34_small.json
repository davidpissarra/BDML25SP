Within these time constraints, it can be challenging to draw insight from such data. While high-capacity machine learning methods are well suited for prediction problems with complex sequence data, extracting interpretable scientiﬁc information with such methods is difﬁcult. Here we leverage powerful AI prediction algorithms and classical statistical inference to identify patterns in the evolution of TC convective structure leading up to the rapid intensiﬁcation of a storm, hence providing forecasters and scientists with key insight into TC behavior. 1 Introduction Background. Tropical cyclones (TCs) are powerful, organized atmospheric systems that draw energy from the upper levels of the ocean. They rank among the deadliest and costliest natural disasters in the United States, and rising ocean heat content promises to amplify their danger over time [ 12]. TC intensity and motion forecasting alike have improved since the 1990s, but intensity forecasting has lagged behind [ 3]. Cases of rapid intensiﬁcation (RI), deﬁned for this work as an intensiﬁcation of at least 25 knots within 24 hours, are especially difﬁcult to predict [7,8,9,20]. Some of the most impactful TCs in recent years underwent RI prior to landfall (e.g., Hurricanes Irma [2017], Dorian [2019], and Ida [2021]). Understanding TC evolution in the lead-up to RI events is therefore a critical component of forecasting and damage mitigation efforts. In this work, we leverage powerful machine learning (ML) methods to provide scientiﬁc insight into the evolution of TCs leading up to and during such events. Multiple internal and external factors drive TC behavior [ 9]. This work focuses on a key internal factor: the spatio-temporal structure of deep convection—that is, vertical circulation of air—within the storm. Convective patterns within TCs serve as reliable indicators of intensity and drivers of intensity change; for example, identifying convective patterns is critical to the Dvorak Technique for TC intensity estimation [ 4,15,16,5]. Since temperature generally decreases with height in the troposphere, the temperature of a cloud top is a proxy for its altitude. Thus taller clouds have colder tops, implying deeper (and thus stronger) convection. Stronger convection, particularly near the TC center, tends to be associated with stronger TCs. Infrared (IR) imagery from geostationary satellites such as the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES) provide high spatio-temporal resolution estimates of cloud-top temperature ( 10:4\u0016mwavelength) [19]. Scientiﬁc Goals. TC intensity forecasts are ultimately issued by human experts who synthesize domain knowledge with the outputs of many forecasting tools to issue a single forecast. It is thus unproductive to provide another statistical model which only predicts TC intensity directly from IR imagery; such black-box models are difﬁcult for forecasters to utilize. Our goal is instead to provide meteorologists with an enhanced understanding of how convective evolution relates to RI events (Figure 1, blue arrow). Currently operational statistical forecast tools are generally limited to a handful of scalar summary statistics from each GOES image to aid forecasters in quickly digesting convective behavior [ 2,1,9]. Conversely, we work with the rich suite of ORB functions, a dictionary of scientiﬁcally meaningful one-dimensional functional features [ 14]. In this paper, we illustrate our methods Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2021.Figure 1: From Observation to Ma- chine Learning to Science. Meteorol- ogists seek to connect observations and summaries of TC evolution to processes such as RI (blue path). We pose this sci- entiﬁc question as a hypothesis test (bot- tom right). By casting the hypothesis test as a prediction problem, we are able to leverage high-capacity AI techniques, here ANNs (top right).
