An XGBoost  algorithm champion model is compared  to two challenger models : 1) a model that  extends the champion model  by incorporating building and property  characteri stics and 2) a model  that utilizes a neural network approach. Results  show  that while all models perform well  in predicting business failure risk post - disaster event, the model that uses buildi ng and property characteristics performs  best across all performance metrics.

Drought and persistent heat are creating warmer, drier  conditions that lead to longer wildfire seasons  and climate change has been identified as a key driver  in increasing wildfire conditions [2, 3]. Additionally, housing growth in the wildland -urban  interface, which is areas where housing meets or intermingles with wildland vegetation,  has  increased the risk of human -caused wildfires and the risk of damage to structures due to housing  locations  in areas that are at greater risk for wildfire exposure [4].  The negative consequences  associated with wildfire events impact both communities and the econom y. Direct impacts include  damage or loss of businesses  and homes, while indirect impacts can include reduced economic  activity from decreases in physical economic activity (e.g., foot traffic and tourism ) because of   smoke compromising air quality  [1, 5, 6].  Although the re is an abundance of wildfire impact research with regards to residential housing, less  work has been dedicated to understanding t he impact of wildfire on commercial businesses.

In this context, business  survival can be defined as maintaining business -as-usual operations and remaining active in the  months after a wildfire event, as opposed to going out of business or becoming commercially  inactive. In essence this contributes to r esilience, which has been studied in the literature relating to  community, economic, and business resilience  [7, 8, 9]. Prior studies have also developed wildfire  vulnerability indexes and modeling that are limited to building characteristics, landscape, a nd social  vulnerability [ 10, 11, 12]. While some aspects of these previously developed indices  are useful  in  predicting  business vulnerability, there exists a gap in extending wildfire vulnerability to businesses ’  operational status, influenced by financial health,  and their ability to recover from a natural disaster.  This paper addresses the gap by presenting a Wildfire V ulnerability Index (WVI) that measures the  risk of business failure, which is defined as going out of business or becoming inactive,  in the  months that follow a wildfire event. The WVI  is based on the concept that a natural disaster event,  such as wildfire, can negatively impact operating infrastructure or the ability to operate the company  in a business -as-usual manner, which  can impact a company’s financial situation  and cause  persistent  change in its operational status. These impacts on a subset of commerce can more broadly  affect the business community and macroeconomic landscape because business relationships are  complex, spanning geographies and crossing industries. As extreme weather events become more  prevalent under climate change, i dentifying and quantifying t he linkage between operational status,  business activity, and macroeconomic distress from natural disaster events is becoming increasingly  important.
