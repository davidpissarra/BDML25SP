There is thus need for high quality datasets to properly validate ML-based solutions. To this end, we present ForestBench, which aims to collect and curate geographically-balanced gold-standard datasets of small-scale forest plots in the Global South, by collecting ground-level measurements and visual drone imagery of individual trees. These equitable validation datasets for ML-based MRV of nature-based solutions shall enable assessing the progress of ML models for estimating above-ground biomass, ground cover, and tree species diversity. 1 Background The deterioration of the natural world is unparalleled in human history and a key driver of the current climate crisis and global extinction [ 1–3]. In the past twenty years, we have lost forest area equivalent to the size of Europe, accounting for more than 7% of global anthropogenic emissions [4,5]. Reducing deforestation, restoring ecosystems, and natural sequestrating of carbon are therefore of uttermost importance and urgency. A current approach to finance the needed restoration of forest ecosystems are carbon offsets. The carbon offsetting market is expected to grow 100-fold until 2050 due to high demand and available capital [ 6,7]. However, an obstacle is the limited supply of offsetting projects, as forest owners lack upfront capital and market access [ 8]. The standardized forest carbon stock inventory consists of manually measuring and registering sample trees on sample areas on the project site. Tree metrics such as Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), height, and species are then put through scientifically developed regression models called allometric equations [ 9] to calculate the Aboveground Biomass (AGB). The total biomass of a forest is the sum of the total AGB and the total Belowground Biomass (BGB), calculated using a Root-Shoot Ratio (RSR) specific to the forest type and region [10]. Accurately estimating forest carbon stock, especially for small-scale carbon offset projects below 10,000 ha, presents several challenges, such as high variance of species and occlusion of individual tree Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.crowns [ 11–13]. There are many promising approaches, such as hyper-spectral species classification [14], LiDAR-based height measurements [ 15] and individual tree crown segmentation across sites [16]. In recent years, remote sensing and Machine Learning (ML) have been used to estimate biomass [17,18] based on drone and satellite data, to automate parts of the certification process of forestry carbon offsetting projects [ 19,20]. We may soon have mapped every tree on earth [ 21], enabling forest AGB and carbon to be estimated at scale [22, 23, 18]. Recent research has however shown that the current manual forest carbon stock practices systemat- ically overestimate forestry carbon offsetting projects [ 24–26], unless they are properly calibrated and transparently validated [ 13]. This even applies to the latest generation satellite programs such as GEDI [ 18,27]. One reason is that these applications have been developed mainly on datasets from boreal and temperate forests, which are not suitable for other types of ecosystems. To the best of our knowledge, there is no publicly available dataset of tropical forests with both aerial imagery and ground truth field measurements, as reviewed in [ 28], and very little available data of that kind from the Global South in general, putting these regions at a disadvantage when competing in the global carbon emission market. There is thus need for higher-quality carbon offsetting data to achieve more transparency and accountability in the Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) of the forest carbon stock [29]. 2 Project description In this position paper, we present ForestBench, which aims to collect and curate geographically- balanced gold-standard open datasets of small-scale forest plots, with a focus on currently under- represented forest ecosystems in the Global South. In particular, our aim is to collect field-based ground-level measurements of forest value, i. e., tree biomass, in order to develop equitable bench- marks for ML-based MRV, as well as drone aerial images that serve to calibrate the benchmarks. Top-down monitoring with satellites is globally available, but less accurate. On the other hand, the bottom-up approach using drones and, e. g., wildlife cams and individual tree measurements, allows a more localized and accurate estimation of carbon content, in particular the below-ground carbon. We hence aim to provide data that allows for these two approaches to meet in the middle, allowing for a synthesis of comprehensive datasets. This is important to validate future ML models, and hence making sure that carbon credits are correctly evaluated and fair. At the same time, we aim to provide economic opportunity for local and Indigenous communities by collaborating with them for the data collection. Our project builds on top of our previous work [ 26], and is\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
