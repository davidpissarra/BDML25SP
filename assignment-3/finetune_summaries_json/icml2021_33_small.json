Introduction Electricity market pricing is one of the most crucial tasks of operating large-scale power grids. As part of the dereg- ulated electricity market, real-time market determines the incremental adjustment to the day-ahead dispatch by solving the optimal power ﬂow (OPF) problem (Cain et al., 2012), which aims at the most economic decisions for the ﬂexible generation or demand while satisfying a variety of safety- related network constraints. The real-time OPF or market pricing is instrumental for ensuring high efﬁciency and re- liability of grid operations (Cain et al., 2012), particularly under the increasing integration of intermittent and variable resources towards a low-carbon energy future. Energy sources to a majority of electric power grids rely heavily on fossil fuels, which contribute to a signiﬁcant portion of world-wide greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Such environment effects can be directly accounted by the formulation of OPF to reduce GHG emissions (Yang et al., 1Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Uni- versity of Texas at Austin, Austin, United States.

Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning orkshop at ICML 2021.2015; Li et al., 2011; Shao & Jewell, 2010; Gholami et al., 2014). Meanwhile, the increasing integration of renewable sources such as wind and solar can greatly diminish the overall carbon footprint of electricity generation. However, the variability of renewable generation poses as a main challenge in real-time solutions of OPF problem. As a result, the grid operating conditions change rapidly, traditional iterative methods initialized by the past solutions (Castillo & O’Neill, 2013) may incur convergence and computation issues. The accurate ac-OPF problem is known to incur high com- putation complexity due to its non-linear, non-convex for- mulation (Cain et al., 2012). For efﬁcient online solution, machine learning (ML) techniques have been recently advo- cated through extensive off-line training of neural network (NN) models. Existing ML-for-OPF approaches have fo- cused on identifying the active constraints (Misra et al., 2018; Deka & Misra, 2019; Chen & Zhang, 2020), ﬁnding a warm start for iterative OPF solutions (Baker, 2019), or addressing the feasibility issue (Pan et al., 2019; Guha et al., 2019; Zamzam & Baker, 2020). Almost all of them rely on end-to-end NNs, which incur high model and computation complexity for large-scale power grids. In addition to scala- bility issue, they need to be constantly re-trained whenever the system inputs change as a result of frequently varying grid resources or topology. Thus, existing approaches fall short in efﬁciently transferring the knowledge obtained from off-line training into fast, adaptive online OPF decisions. To tackle these challenges, we propose to leverage the graph neural networks (GNNs) to design a topology-aware OPF learning framework. The GNN architecture (Kipf & Welling, 2016; Gama et al., 2020; Garg et al., 2020) can effectively incorporate graph-based embedding of nodal features and explore the topology structures of the underly- ing prediction models. While a very recent work (Owerko et al., 2020) has used GNNs to predict OPF’s nodal power injections, the latter mainly depends on the cost of dispatch- ing each resource and does not share any topology-based similarity, or the locality property that is ideal for GNN- based predictions. Hence, we instead advocate to predict the actual OPF outputs for electricity market, namely the locational marginal prices (LMPs) known as the real-time market signals (Wood et al., 2013). As LMPs relate to the duality analysis for OPF, their dependence on grid topologyGraph Neural Networks for Learning Real-Time Prices in Electricity Market has been recognized in (Jia et al., 2013; Geng & Xie, 2016). To this end, we have introduced the ac- and dc-OPF problem formulations (Section 2) and exploited the topological struc- ture of LMPs to design a GNN-for-OPF learning framework (Section \".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
