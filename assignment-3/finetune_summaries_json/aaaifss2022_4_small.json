Currently, the standard method to enumerate harmful algae and other phytoplankton is to manually observe and count them under a micro- scope. This is a time-consuming, tedious and error- prone process, resulting in wrong counts and com- promised management decisions by farmers. Hence, automating this process for quick and accurate HAB monitoring is extremely helpful. However, this requires large and diverse datasets of phytoplankton images, and such datasets are hard to produce quickly. In this work, we explore the feasibility of generating novel high-resolution photorealistic synthetic phytoplankton images, containing multiple species in the same im- age, given a small dataset of real images. To this end, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic images. We evaluate three differ- ent GAN architectures: ProjectedGAN, FastGAN, and StyleGANv2 using standard image quality metrics. We empirically show the generation of high-fidelity syn- thetic phytoplankton images using a training dataset of only 961 real images. Thus, this work demonstrates the ability of GANs to create large synthetic datasets of phytoplankton from small training datasets, accom- plishing a key step towards sustainable systematic mon- itoring of harmful algal blooms. Introduction When different phytoplankton and algae species grow un- controllably, they can form harmful algal blooms (HABs). These HABs can produce lethal toxins and hypoxic “dead” zones, causing catastrophic impacts on various industries such as aquaculture and real estate (Brooks et al. 2016), as well as negatively impacting wildlife and the environ- ment (Gran ´eli and Turner 2006). Further, research shows that climate change is increasing the frequency and sever- ity of these HABs (Wells et al. 2020). For example, in 2016, Copyright © 2022, Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.a HAB outbreak in Chile killed over 27 million farmed trout and salmon (Montes et al. 2018). Furthermore, from 2015- 2019, farmed salmon deaths due to fatal diseases caused by HABs increased by 27.8% from 41.3 to 52.8 million (Pers- son et al. 2022). When millions of fish die due to HABs and other diseases, they are disposed of by being dumped back into the ocean, causing ocean pollution, or being brought to landfills, causing increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emis- sions (Armijo et al. 2020; Bustos, Ram ´ırez, and Rudolf 2021). Furthermore, as GHG emissions increase, the sur- face temperature and acidity of water bodies increase simul- taneously, creating an ideal environment for HABs to grow, thereby leading to an endless cycle of increasing GHG emis- sions (Moore et al. 2008). A promising solution to mitigate this problem is quicker and more consistent monitoring of HABs as early detection allows for treatment to occur before the blooms rapidly du- plicate. This would improve farm yields, as well as reduce ocean pollution and GHG emissions. However, rapid identi- fication is challenging due to the extremely time-consuming, tedious and error-prone process for a taxonomist to manu- ally analyze and classify these algae species (McQuatters- Gollop et al. 2017). Given digital microscopy and novel deep learning meth- ods, it is possible to improve both the speed and accuracy of current algae detection methods (Salido et al. 2020). How- ever, such methods require the collection of large and diverse phytoplankton datasets, which is both expensive and tedious, thereby limiting the effectiveness of current HAB monitor- ing as shown in the “Current Method” section of Figure 4. Moreover, it is important that such datasets match real im- ages as far as possible, so they should ideally include multi- ple phytoplankton species in the same image. In this work, we propose a framework to generate high- fidelity and diverse synthetic datasets of phytoplankton, mo- tivated by the potential to expedite, improve, and standard- ize algae and phytoplankton detection. This is shown in the “Proposed Method” section of Figure 4. We utilize Gener- ative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate novel syn- thetic images, but in principle any image generation tech- nique could be used.
