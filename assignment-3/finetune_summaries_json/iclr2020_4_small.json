Timely distribution of disaster relief funds is essential to help minimise the impact of drought. Indices of vegetation health are indicative of higher risk of agricultural drought, but their prediction remains challenging, particularly in Africa. Here, we present an open-source machine learning pipeline for climate-related data. Speciﬁcally, we train and analyse a recurrent model to predict pixel-wise vegetation health in Kenya. 1 Introduction Drought is estimated to be one of the world’s most costly hazards, accounting for 22% of damage from natural disasters (Wilhite et al., 2007). Since 1980, East Africa has experienced a number of severe droughts. There is evidence to suggest that droughts are becoming longer and more frequent in the region due to climate change (Nicholson, 2017). The timely prediction of drought can help reduce the risk of a hazard turning into a social or environmental disaster, by improving the response times of NGOs and governments (Hillier and Dempsey, 2012). In Kenya, the National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) has distributed emergency funds through the Drought Contingency Fund since 2014 (Klisch and Atzberger, 2016). Currently, the funds are distributed depending on near-real time indices drawn from satellite imagery. Despite the importance of predicting drought occurrence and impact, it remains challenging, particularly in East Africa, due to the complex interactions of large scale atmospheric circulation with local orography (Gebremeskel Haile et al., 2019). In this paper we demonstrate the use of a machine learning pipeline for improving the prediction of the vegetation health index used by the NDMA. In particular, we train a regular Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and an Entity-Aware LSTM (Kratzert et al., 2019) to predict seasonal drought conditions in Kenya, measured by the Vegetation Condition Index averaged over 3 months (VCI3M) (Kogan, 1997). The VCI3M is a satellite-derived measurement of anomalous vegetation health. Our models outperform a persistence baseline for predictions one month ahead. In addition, they are competitive with a model implemented by the NDMA (Adede et al., 2019) while producing much more spatially granular predictions. In this paper, we focus on the same four arid districts as Adede et al. (2019). As an additional contribution, we present an open-source pipeline for training machine learning algorithms with multiple sources of climate-related data. \u0003Equal Contributions 1Published as a workshop paper at ICLR 2020 (a) Observed 3 Month Vegetation Condition Index (VCI3M) in April 2017, showing low vegetation health across most of the region (b) The eﬀect (Shap value) of spatially aggre- gated precipitation on the model predictions for a prediction made for March 2018.
