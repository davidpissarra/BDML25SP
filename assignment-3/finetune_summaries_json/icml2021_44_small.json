Introduction Extreme weather and climate events can severely impact communities, infrastructure, agriculture and other natural and human systems. The observed increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events has been directly linked to anthropogenic climate change, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years (Herring et al., 2021). Improv- ing our understanding of the impacts of climate change on weather and climate extremes and developing early warning systems for better preparedness is of paramount importance. This short paper is concerned with extreme precipitation prediction, which can cause ﬂooding, crop damage, and widespread disruption to ecosystems. The ability to con- ﬁdently predict the likelihood of extreme precipitation at sub-seasonal to seasonal scales remains a signiﬁcant chal- lenge (King et al., 2020).

(2021), Cohen et al. (2019)). These ML models tend to rely on slowly-changing variables, such as soil moisture and El Ni˜no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices (Fernando et al., 2019). Although most of these variables are publicly avail- able, the degree of inﬂuence of each one regarding precip- itation prediction varies in space and time (e.g., Strazzo et al. (2019)). Properly accounting for these effects in a ML model is a complex task. In this work, we present an ML approach to forecast the maximum daily precipitation in each week up to six months ahead. Our approach uses the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model, which combines multi-horizon forecasting with specialized components to select relevant inputs and suppress unnecessary features (Lim et al., 2019). Of partic- ular interest to both researchers and end-users, the TFT pro- duces multiple quantiles. These quantiles offer a global view of the interrelations between the input and output (Davino et al., 2013) and can help risk management by indicating the likely best and worst-case values of the target variable (Lim et al., 2019). To the Authors’ knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time the TFT has been used to forecast extreme weather. 2. Methodology We deﬁne our task as a quantile forecast for precipitation in multiple locations. The structure is similar to the one presented in (Lim et al., 2019), where the authors consider three kinds of input: (a) static s2Rms, (b) known future x2Rmx, and (c) historical z2Rmz(Figure 1 – yellow, pink, and blue, respectively). Static information does not change through time, e.g., location or altitude. Examples of known future information are the month-of-the-year and external predictions for the target and other variables such as precipitation and temperature. Although predictions are not “known information” and may have errors, their use follows the same procedure as future inputs. Finally, historical inputs are the actual past values for the target series or any other exogenous one, e.g., temperature or soil moisture.

Introduction\n\nExtreme weather and climate events can severely impact communities, infrastructure, agriculture, and other natural and human systems. The observed increase in frequency and intensity of extreme events has been directly linked to anthropogenic climate change, and the trend is expected to continue in the coming years (Herring et al., 2021). Improving our understanding of the impacts of climate change on weather and climate extremes and developing early warning systems for better preparedness is of paramount importance. This short paper focuses on extreme precipitation prediction, which can cause flooding, crop damage, and widespread disruption to ecosystems. The ability to confidently predict the likelihood of extreme precipitation at sub-seasonal to seasonal scales remains a significant challenge (King et al., 2020). Recent works have shown that statistical machine learning (ML) models can outperform state-of-the-art dynamical models when predicting extreme events several months ahead (e.g., Chantry et al., 2021, Cohen et al., 2019). These ML models tend to rely on slowly changing variables, such as soil moisture and El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) indices (Fernando et al., 2019). Although most of these variables are publicly available, the degree of influence of each one regarding precipitation prediction varies in space and time (e.g., Strazzo et al., 2019). Properly accounting for these effects in a ML model is a complex task.\n\nIn this work, we present an ML approach to forecast the maximum daily precipitation in each week up to six months ahead. Our approach uses the temporal fusion transformer (TFT) model, which combines multi-horizon forecasting with specialized components to select relevant inputs and suppress unnecessary features (Lim et al., 2019). Of particular interest to both researchers and end-users, the TFT produces multiple quantiles. These quantiles offer a global view of the interrelations between the input and output (Davino et al., 2013) and can help risk management by indicating the likely best and worst-case values of the target variable (Lim et al., 2019). To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time the TFT has been used to forecast extreme weather.\n\n2. Methodology\n\nWe define our task as a quantile forecast for precipitation in multiple locations. The structure is similar to the one presented in (Lim et al., 2019), where the authors consider three kinds of input: (a) static information, (b) known future information, and (c) historical information. Static information does not change through time, e.g., location or altitude. Examples of known future information are the month-of-the-year and external predictions for the target and other variables such as precipitation and temperature. Historical inputs are the actual past values for the target series or any other exogenous one, e.g., temperature or soil moisture. We produce weekly forecasts for each location in the form y(lat, lon, q, t, l), where each time-step t refers to a specific week in the time series, and l is the lead time in weeks. The index (lat, lon) refers to the location in the globe, and it is associated with a set of static inputs si, as well as the time-dependent inputs zi,t and xi,t. We predict the quantiles 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 of the maximum daily rainfall for each week up to six months ahead in our setup. Each quantile is represented by y(i, q, t, l) = f(q, y(i, t), zi,t, xi,t, si)."
