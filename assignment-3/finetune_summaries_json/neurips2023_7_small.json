In order to mitigate methane atmospheric emissions from oil and gas industry, the potential emitting infrastructure must be monitored. Initiatives such as the Methane Alert and Response System (MARS), launched by the United Nations Environment Program, aim to locate significant emissions events, alert relevant stakeholders, as well as monitor and track progress in mitigation efforts. To achieve this goal, an automated solution is needed for consistent monitoring across multiple oil and gas basins around the world. Most methane emissions analysis studies propose post-emission analysis. The works and future guidelines presented in this paper aim to provide an automated collection of informed methane emissions by oil and gas site and infrastructure which are necessary to dress emission profile in near real time. This proposed framework also permits to create action margins to reduce methane emissions by passing from post methane emissions analysis to forecasting methods. 1 Introduction Atmospheric methane accounts for about a quarter of global warming since pre-industrial times, and the oil and gas sector is the second largest anthropogenic source of methane. To meet the mitigation targets set out in the Global Methane Commitment, governments need to implement effective mitigation measures at the scale and pace required. Current regulations are based on national methane emissions inventories, which studies show significantly underestimate methane sources in all emissions sectors. Most of the discrepancy in emissions estimates is due to the failure to include super- emitters in emissions inventories. Such sources are characterized by high emission rates and account for 40% of total methane emissions on average. Emission estimates can be greatly improved by taking advantage of the increasing availability of methane emission data. This can be achieved by using and combining data from high-resolution satellites to measure methane concentrations, which has the advantage of being the more cost-effective tool for monitoring methane emissions. The International Methane Emissions Observatory (IMEO), launched by the United Nations Environment Program, is Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.Figure 1: Emissions profile determination process. Satellite images @Google Earth an initiative that aims to create a global public dataset of empirically verified methane emissions by integrating and combining data primarily from many sources, including various point-source satellite data sources. However, once these methane emissions are identified and quantified globally, they must be traceable to the levels of the O&G supply chain, site, operator, and infrastructure at which they originated in order to understand their origins and thus better tailor regulations and mitigation actions. The Methane Alert and Response System (MARS), launched by the UN environmental program at COP27, aims to notify relevant governments and companies of major emissions events in or near their jurisdictions or operations, which could help stop unwanted methane leaks more quickly. To monitor methane emissions in various O&G basins around the world, this task must be automated using machine learning algorithms. Indeed, as illustrated on the Figure 1, artificial intelligence could play a critical role at several stages of the worldwide methane emissions monitoring process by permitting a nearly continuous monitoring in near real time. Various studies [ 2,3,4,5,6,7] using deep learning algorithms propose to automatically detect and quantify methane plumes from multispectral and hyperspectral satellite data. Other studies have examined O&G site type detection[ 8,9] and infrastructure detection[ 10]. These two main steps should enable the generation of geographical coordinates for both methane plumes and their corresponding infrastructures. An automatic matching process is also required to associate all the plumes detected with the emitting infrastructures. Over a medium-to-long-term period, all these steps should make it possible to obtain time series of methane emission levels by infrastructure, site, operator, region and country. Obtaining such data over the long term will make it possible to characterize and predict emissions behavior. In this paper, focus will be given to the detection of infrastructure and the matching between infrastructures and methane plumes. 2 Oil and Gas infrastructure automated detection Sites in the oil and gas industry that contain wells, storage tanks, or compressor infrastructures are considered to be significant contributors of fugitive emissions and therefore form the targets that we wish to automatically detect. Existing approaches [ 11,12,13,14,15,16,10,17,18] to oil and gas infrastructure detection typically do not allow for the simultaneous detection of multiple infrastructures.
