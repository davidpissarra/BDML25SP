We experiment with a two-step protocol. In the first step, we em- ploy an SSL algorithm and learn generic weather representa- tions from multivariate weather data. Then, in the next step, we use these representations and train simple linear models for multiple downstream tasks. Through our experiments on air quality prediction tasks, we highlight the benefits of self- supervised weather representations. The benefits include im- proved performance across multiple tasks, the ability to gen- eralize with limited in-task data, and a reduction in training time and carbon emissions. We highlight several areas of fu- ture work and the potential impact that such algorithms can have on real-world problems. We expect such a direction to be relevant in multiple weather-driven applications support- ing climate change mitigation and adaptation efforts. Introduction The self-supervised learning (SSL) paradigm has gained popularity recently to extract effective representations from unlabeled data (Devlin et al. 2019; Brown et al. 2020). The idea is to pretrain models by defining learning tasks called pretext tasks on the unlabelled data itself without a spe- cific target, and learning generic representations on the un- labelled data by training models to solve the pretext task. These representations are generic because the objectives they are trained to optimize are independent of any down- stream task. These pre-trained models are then adapted/fine- tuned to a target task downstream and have often been ob- served to outperform their supervised counterparts on the downstream tasks. Further, in scenarios of limited labelled data, they showcase huge improvements (Chen et al. 2020c; Azizi et al. 2021).

However, these techniques have not been aptly investigated in the context of weather data. Weather data possess special characteristics such as being multivariate, geospatial, having non-linear relationships be- tween weather attributes, etc. In the past few years, different types of weather data such as reanalysis, fore(hind)casts and observation data are available from multiple sources with a rich history. However, this readily available data is not ef- fectively utilized in weather-driven applications, particularly for applications with limited labelled data. Such limited data scenarios arise in many domains: renewable energy gener- ation forecasting when a new set of wind turbines are de- ployed on a farm, limited sensor observation for air pollu- tion prediction, crop yield prediction with limited historical estimates available, and many more. Thus, self-supervised representations of weather data can be a powerful approach to address such practical problems across domains and ap- plications. In this work, we focus on analysing the exist- ing self-supervised techniques and evaluating the compara- tive benefits of self-supervised representations vs traditional end-to-end supervised approaches. Related work Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a general paradigm for training machine learning models. It is capa- ble of adopting self-defined pseudo labels as supervision and use the learned representations for several downstream tasks, avoiding the cost of annotating large-scale datasets (Jaiswal et al. 2020). SSL has proven to achieve strong per- formance in the domains of computer vision (Chen et al. 2020b; Wang et al. 2021; Azizi et al. 2021), natural language processing (Gao, Yao, and Chen 2021; Logeswaran and Lee 2018) and speech recognition (Baevski et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2021).
