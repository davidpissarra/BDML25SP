Experiments show promising results on estimating tropical cyclone intensity and predicting the occurrence of lightning from satellite imagery. 1 Introduction Machine learning has received great attention in the atmospheric science community over the past couple of years. Many satellite-based applications leverage convolutional neural networks (CNN)s for tasks including but not limited to: forecasting next-hour tornado occurrences [ 1], predicting intense convection [ 2], and estimating topical cyclone intensity [ 3]. These applications create input samples with stacked channel-wise features consisting of satellite imagery at different wavelengths and train a network to recognize certain patterns. While the approach is undoubtedly effective, it is not clear how these input channels are combined in the earlier layers of the network. On the other hand, a trained forecaster may intuitively look at individual channels, or the differences between multiple channels, to identify relevant features and patterns that can easily be explained. Furthermore, these networks are often limited by the quantity of available labeled data, which can lead to a model that underperforms with too few parameters or overfits as complexity increases. This further motivates the need for an architecture that is both interpretable-by-design and generalizable to small datasets. One effective technique to modeling sparsely labeled data is with the scattering transform as was introduced by Mallat [ 4]. This uses a cascade of wavelet transforms with a predetermined filterbank and a non-linear modulus, akin to the structure of CNNs. Not only has the scattering transform shown promise for applications with relatively few training samples [ 5–8], but it also has many nice properties for modeling satellite data. Specifically, the design builds strong geometric invariants (e.g., translations, rotations, and scaling) and is stable to the action of diffeomorphisms – a desirable trait due to the continuous change in cloud structure over time. Studies have also shown the scattering transform to promote sparse representation of data with a high degree of discriminability which can ultimately simplify downstream tasks [5, 9]. To build an architecture that more closely aligns with the visual interpretations of satellite imagery done by forecasters, we incorporate attention into the early layers preceding the scattering transform. Attention mechanisms work to identify salient regions in complex scenes as inspired by aspects of the human visual system [ 10].
