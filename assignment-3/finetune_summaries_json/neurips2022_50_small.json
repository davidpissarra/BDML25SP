Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a remote sensing tech- nique that can provide measurements of affected areas independent of weather or lighting conditions. Usage of SAR, however, is hindered by domain knowledge that is necessary for the pre-processing steps and its interpretation requires ex- pert knowledge. We provide simpliﬁed, pre-processed, machine-learning ready SAR datacubes for four globally located landslide events obtained from several Sentinel-1 satellite passes before and after a landslide triggering event together with segmentation maps of the landslides. From this dataset, using the Hokkaido, Japan datacube, we study the feasibility of SAR-based landslide detection with supervised deep learning (DL). Our results demonstrate that DL models can be used to detect landslides from SAR data, achieving an Area under the Precision-Recall curve exceeding 0.7. We ﬁnd that additional satellite visits enhance detection performance, but that early detection is possible when SAR data is combined with terrain information from a digital elevation model. This can be especially useful for time-critical emergency interventions.

Rising temperatures and climate \u0003Authors contributed equally. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2022.arXiv:2211.02869v1  [eess.SP]  5 Nov 2022change are projected to worsen this situation [ 2,3] with the increase of sustained droughts and intense rainfall events [ 4,5,6]. Given these predictions, there is a growing need for timely and accurate landslide assessment methods that can inform decision makers and emergency responders. In the aftermath of a landslide, optical satellite imagery is commonly used to map the extent of the event. The fact that optical data is is often hindered by clouds and limited to day time observations, motivates the study of weather independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) as a monitoring technique. DL algorithms for computer vision can be used for SAR analysis if SAR data is represented as images (or georeferenced data arrays) [ 7]. This has been exploited for multiple use cases such as the detection of volcanic activity [ 8], ﬂoods [ 9], and landslides[ 10]. The landslide change detection with DL can be performed in two ways: object-level [ 11] and pixel-level detection [ 10]. As per the authors’ best knowledge [ 10,11] are one of the ﬁrst studies in landslide mapping using DL and SAR images where bi- and tri-temporal images have been used. Usage of multi-temporal SAR polarization modes has been demonstrated with traditional approaches, such as thresholding [ 12], similar conclusion was reported in a DL study [ 13]. To achieve good accuracy, these methods require longer time series of SAR data (up to months after the event), which are unavailable in an emergency scenario. The development of DL algorithms for SAR analysis, however, is still hindered by its complex characteristics and pre-procesisng requirements. To help overcome this barrier, we publicly release curated DL-ready datasets [ 14] that includes SAR intensity and interferometry data before and after disaster events that triggered landslides. Using part of this dataset, we further develop a supervised DL algorithm for landslide detection and demonstrate the feasibility of rapid detection using only one satellite pass, if SAR data is combined with terrain information. 2 Data We produce analysis-ready datacubes [ 14] with multiple layers of SAR time-series data and auxiliary geographic information for multiple landslide events. To this end, we develop a data pipeline that processes SAR intensity and interferometric products from multiple sources and compile them together with a Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and DEM-derived products into a format that can be fed into DL models (see Fig. 1).
