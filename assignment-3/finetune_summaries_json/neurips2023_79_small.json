Wetlands stand out as the predominant natural contributor to global methane emissions. Accurate modeling of methane emissions from wetlands is crucial for understanding and predicting climate change dynamics. However, such modeling efforts are often constrained by the inherent uncertainties in model parameters. Our work leverages machine learning (ML) to calibrate five physical parameters of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM) to improve the model’s accuracy in simulating wetland methane emissions. Unlike traditional deterministic calibration methods that target a single set of optimal values for each parameter, Bayesian calibration takes a probabilistic approach and enables capturing the inherent uncertainties in complex systems and providing robust parameter distributions for reliable predictions. However, Bayesian calibration requires numerous model runs and makes it computationally expensive. We employed an ML algorithm, Gaussian process regression (GPR), to emulate the ELM’s methane model, which dramatically reduced the computational time from 6 CPU hours to just 0.72 milliseconds per simulation. We exemplified the procedure at a representative FLUXNET-CH4 site (US-PFa) with the longest continuous methane emission data. Results showed that the default values for two of the five parameters examined were not aligned well with their respective posterior distributions, suggesting that the model’s default parameter values might not always be optimal for all sites, and that site-specific analysis is warranted. In particular, analyses at sites with different vegetation types and wetland characteristics could reveal more useful insights for understanding methane emissions modeling.  1 Introduction and Motivation Greenhouse gas (GHG)-induced climate change poses unprecedented challenges and serious risks for human society and natural environment. Methane is the second most important GHG, with ~25 times stronger 100-year global warming potential than carbon dioxide [1, 2]. Since the Industrial Revolution, the atmospheric concentrations of CH4 have sharply risen and doubled since pre-industrial times. Alarmingly, its growth rate in 2021 marked the highest record since 1984 [3–5]. Such increases have profound implications for global warming and highlight the urgency to manage its emissions effectively. Wetlands account for approximately 30% of global methane emissions and are the primary natural source [6]. However, wetland methane emission estimates based on biogeochemistry models remain highly uncertain [7, 8], mainly because CH4 dynamics rely on a Sandeep Chinta Center for Global Change Science,  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA. sandeepc@mit.edu    Xiang Gao Center for Global Change Science,  Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, Cambridge,  Massachusetts, USA. xgao304@mit.edu  Qing Zhu  Climate Sciences Department,  Lawrence Berkeley  National Laboratory,  Berkeley, California, USA. qzhu@lbl.gov     2 large number of poorly constrained model parameters to characterize a diverse array of physical, biological, and chemical processes [9, 10]. While these parameters typically have fixed (default) values, their exact values are often ambiguous and present large uncertainty. The parameter values are usually determined within their theoretically plausible uncertainty ranges based on the most reliable knowledge available. One of the essential paths to achieve reduced biases in methane emission estimates is to identify the most critical model parameters via sensitivity analysis [11] and determine their optimal distribution through calibration [12]. Traditional deterministic calibration methods focus on identifying an optimal parameter value by comparing model output to observations, frequently neglecting the inherent predictive uncertainties and incorrectly assuming that there is always a single set of optimal values for all parameters [13]. Nevertheless, a single optimal set may not always exist for a problem. Even if it exists, the associated uncertainties could be large. Moreover, several alternative parameter configurations may yield similarly accurate results, challenging the notion of a single optimal parameter set [14, 15]. Considering these challenges posed by the deterministic calibration methods and the inherent complexities of methane models, there is a need for a more nuanced and statistically rigorous approach to parameter calibration. Probabilistic approaches like Bayesian calibration handle these issues by statistically representing parameter uncertainties [16]. The input parameter space is represented as probability distributions of parameters. Multiple parameter samples are drawn from this distribution, and simulations are conducted for these samples, inherently creating an ensemble of model predictions. An objective function is used to evaluate the prediction range by comparing these simulation outputs with observations. After calibration, final posterior distributions of the parameters are obtained. When samples are drawn from these distributions, the resulting simulations, forming an ensemble, more closely match the observations. However, it is important to note that this approach generally requires massive computational power to simulate the methane model multiple times. Hence, there is a compelling need for strategies like machine learning that can facilitate this process but also retain accuracy. ML-based emulators have emerged as a pivotal tool to emulate the behavior of complex earth system models for achieving this goal. These emulators are first trained on a subset of model simulations to learn the intricate relationships between inputs and outputs.
