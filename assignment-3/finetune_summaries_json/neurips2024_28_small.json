Our method achieves an average reduction of approximately 4% compared to industry-standard ASHRAE guidelines, contributing to more sustainable data center management and offering valuable insights for reducing the environmental impact of HPC operations. 1 Introduction As digital infrastructure continues to expand, the need for sustainable and energy-efficient data centers has become increasingly critical. Liquid cooling systems have emerged as a particularly promising solution for high-performance computing (HPC) applications with dense accelerator embeddings due to their superior thermal conductivity, allowing for more effective heat dissipation than traditional air-cooling methods. To derive the full potential of these liquid-cooled systems, we need sophisticated control strategies with a framework for real-time decision-making and dynamic adjustments based on changing workloads and environmental conditions. Our research introduces RL-LC, a Reinforcement Learning-based approach designed to optimize the liquid cooling process in data centers. By controlling the coolant flow rate and supply liquid temperature, RL-LC creates an adaptive system that continuously optimizes energy efficiency relative to varying workloads and environmental conditions. This approach contributes to achieving energy and carbon efficiency goals by minimizing resource consumption in data centers. Our method has demonstrated significant results, achieving an average reduction of around 4% in energy consumption and carbon emissions, illustrating its potential to advance sustainable data center operations. 2 Literature Review Liquid cooling is increasingly favored in data centers for its energy efficiency and scalability, espe- cially in high-density environments, reducing cooling energy consumption by 29−50%, improving ∗Corresponding author. †These authors contributed equally.
