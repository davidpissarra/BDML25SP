To address this issue, we develop an input-convex neural network (ICNN) aided optimization routine which incorporates a set of trained ICNNs approximating the gas flow equations with high precision. Numerical tests on the Belgium gas network demonstrate that the ICNN-aided optimization dominates non-convex and relaxation-based solvers, with larger optimality gains pertaining to stricter emission targets. 1 I NTRODUCTION Energy system operators worldwide introduce carbon reduction measures to control the emission content of energy supply (Liu and Raftery, 2021). Such measures include soft monetary penalties (e.g., carbon tax) or hard emission constraints (e.g., carbon cap or renewable portfolio standard) within operational planning routines. When operation planning is insufficient, more expensive yet effective long-term planning optimizes network design in order to accommodate more environment-friendly supply. In gas networks, carbon reduction measures can be used to prioritize pipeline-quality gas from renewable suppliers, such as biogas produced from organic matter, syngas produced by steam reforming, or hydrogen produced from electrolysis at large offshore wind sites, like the proposed North Sea hub (NSW, 2022). However, solving such planning optimization problems with emission targets is challenging due to complex gas flow physics. Contributions. To meet emission targets in gas networks, we develop a new optimization method that substitutes the non-convex Weymouth equation of gas flows with a composition of trained input-convex and input-concave neural networks (ICNNs). Together, they explain the dependency of gas flows on nodal pressures. We embed trained ICNNs into planning optimization problems in a computationally tractable manner. Tests on the Belgium gas network demonstrate that ICNN-aided optimization successfully solves generally intractable optimization problems and facilitates reducing the overall emission footprint of gas networks. 1.1 R ELATED WORK Gas network optimization. Designing optimization methods to aid operation planning dates back to at least 1979 (O’Neill et al., 1979). Since then, solvers based on mixed-integer (Wilson et al., 1988), piece-wise linear (De Wolf and Smeers, 2000), quadratic (Singh and Kekatos, 2019; 2020) and semi-definite (Ojha et al., 2017) programming have been introduced. The CO 2footprint of Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2023integrated gas and electricity networks has been addressed by integrating renewables (Ordoudis et al., 2019; Ratha et al., 2020; Roald et al., 2020; Dvorkin et al., 2021; 2022) or directly incorporating carbon reduction measures in operational (Piperagkas et al., 2011; Cheng et al., 2019) and long-term expansion planning problems (Degleris et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2014; Cheng et al., 2018). Neural networks to aid optimization. Using the mixed-integer neural network (NN) reformulation (Tjeng et al., 2017; Xiao et al., 2018; Grimstad and Andersson, 2019), NNs can be used for approx- imating complex input-output dependencies within optimization, e.g., in power systems problems (Murzakhanov et al., 2022; Donon et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2020; Kody et al., 2022). The reformulation represents the activation of each ReLU function using linear and binary constraints parameterized by NN weights and biases, which can be computationally challenging at scale (Grimstad and Andersson, 2019). Here, we explore an alternative functional approximation (i.e., neural surrogate) that relies oninput-convex NNs, whose constrained network weights ensure the output is a convex function of inputs (Amos et al., 2017). Since trained ICNNs can be recast as linear optimization problems (Amos et al., 2017; Duchesne et al., 2021), we leverage them to convert non-convex optimization problems into linear bilevel optimization problems (Pozo et al., 2017). 2 E MISSION -AWARE GAS NETWORK PLANNING PROBLEMS Operational planning problem.
