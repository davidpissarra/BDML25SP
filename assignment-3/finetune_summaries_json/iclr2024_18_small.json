We aim at predicting bees’ health (measured as their activity) and analyzing influencing environmental conditions. We show that we are able to accurately predict bees’ activity and understand their life conditions by using machine learning algorithms and explainable AI. Understanding these conditions can help to make recommendations on good locations for beehives. This work illustrates the potential of apply- ing machine learning on sensor, satellite and weather data for monitoring and predicting species’ health and hence shows the ability for adaptation to climate change and a more accurate species monitoring. 1 Introduction The environmental changes driven by climate change are disturbing natural habitats and species in ways that are still only becoming clear. There are strong signs that rising temperatures, changing rainfall pattern, droughts and extreme weather events are affecting biodiversity [14, 8]. For insects we know that, their number is reduced by two-thirds [15]. The threat posed by climate change to biodiversity is expected to increase, yet thriving ecosystems also have the capacity to help reduce the impacts of climate change [10]. Bees are part of biodiversity, the western honey bee is the most widespread managed pollinator globally, with that it contributes directly to food security, a third of the world’s food production depends on bees, they are essential to people and the planet [4]. Bees’ health is very much correlated to their environmental conditions. The ∗christine.preisach@h-ka.de Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at ICLR 2024pollen collection activity of bees is directly related to bees’ health, since pollen is the only food bees eat. Environmental parameters like temperature, humidity or wind determine the pollen collection activity directly or indirectly, i.e., they either have an impact on the bees’ health itself or on its food sources such as plants or rivers [5, 7]. It is therefore important to consider interactions within an ecosystem when analyzing bees’ health and pollen collection activity. 2 Proposal We propose to analyse environmental factors and verify their influence on bee activity. We are interested in knowing which weather- and time-related condi- tions, as well as which land cover classes have an impact on bee activity. Mea- suring pollen activity and health on one side aids monitoring the environmental conditions [6], i.e., bees’ health can help monitoring and predicting the environ- mental conditions and on the other side helps comprehending which conditions are important for the health of a species. This can aid to make recommenda- tions on good locations for beehives and hence improve the protection of species. Our major aim in this work is to predict bee activity and by doing so analysing the influencing environmental factors. Therefore we applied supervised machine learning methods. Since the prediction target is a numeric variable - bee activ- ity, we used regression algorithms. We conducted many experiments in order to analyse the aforementioned objectives, details are explained in the appendix. 3 Results and Discussion In our experiments we used a 70%/30% split for training and testing our mod- els. We evaluated the prediction quality and analysed the influence of input features on bee activity (see figure 1). For assessing the predictive power of our models, we calculated mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE). Figure 1a depicts MAE andMSE of the learned models applied to test data. The lowest MAE and MSE values were achieved by ANN,RF,DT,SVM. Hence, the relation between input features and bee activity seems not to be linear. Linear models ( GLM,LL,LM) didn’t perform well. We are interested in understanding which weather- and time-related condi- tions show a positive or negative effect on bee activity, therefore we analyzed the importance of features on bee activity. Since not all algorithms used, are explainable and some of the explainable ones are less accurate, we decided to analyze the effect of input features on bee activity with shapley values. However, when comparing the absolute shapely values, they differ from model to model. Therefore it is not possible to decide on the size of an effect over all models. For this reason, we calculated the relative importance (influence) of a feature in a model by dividing the absolute mean shapley value of a feature by the sum of all absolute shapley values of a model. This enables the comparison of feature importance among different models.

We are interested in knowing which weather- and time-related conditions, as well as land cover classes, have an impact on bee activity. Measuring pollen activity and health helps monitor environmental conditions, and vice versa, aiding in comprehending which conditions are essential for a species' health.
