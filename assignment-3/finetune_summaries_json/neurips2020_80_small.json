Increasing coastal populations, concurrent with rising ocean temperatures due to climate change, increase the dangers (such as storm surge and damaging winds) posed by TCs. Thus, accurate prediction of TC trajectories and intensities becomes an ever more critical component of disaster preparation and response. Track forecasting has made great strides since the 1990s, but intensity forecasting, especially in the short-term 12-h and 24-h windows, have seen less pronounced improvements [ 5,3]. Cases of rapid intensity change (30-knot intensity changes in 24 hours), in particular, have proved difﬁcult to predict [ 13,14,28]. TC prediction and science rely in part on the relationships between the external environment, internal structure, and behavior of these storms. For example, vertical wind shear (an external factor) and TC convective patterns (an internal factor) are both known to relate to TC intensities [ 6,14,12]. Forecasters can access a wide array of real-time TC observations of both types, but new public forecasts must be issued every six hours by expert human forecasters. This human-in-the-loop pipeline requires that any forecasting guidance must be easily understood by TC experts. If the output of a method cannot be digested by scientists in a handful of minutes, it will not be adopted by stakeholders at operational centers such as the National Hurricane Center (NHC). The NHC and other operational forecast centers use both physics-based models (dynamical models) and data- driven models (statistical models) [ 3]. The Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS [ 4]) is a particularly successful statistical-dynamical model which largely relates area averages of environmental ﬁelds (such as vertical wind shear) and cloud-top temperatures from infrared (IR) imagery to future TC intensity change. This IR imagery is available at high spatial and temporal resolutions from satellites like the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES1[26,16]). Structure in IR imagery has long been known to relate to TC intensity (see the Dvorak technique [ 6,20]), but the area-averaged values commonly used in statistical models discard critical spatial information. The evolution of spatial structure in such ﬁelds correlates with intensity change, but unlocking this rich source of information in IR imagery without sacriﬁcing interpretability remains an open problem. We propose a framework to incorporate evolving spatial information into intensity forecasts by utilizing deep learning (DL) in the high-dimensional time series setting while remaining cognizant of the needs of the end users: forecasters and scientists. While our end goal is the prediction of short-term intensity changes, our framework 1https://www.star.nesdis.noaa.gov/goes/ 34th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2020), Vancouver, Canada.Figure 1: Framework for combining deep learning (DL) with structural func- tions (ORB) to provide a structural forecast via two pathways. Final forecasts of intensity (bottom-right) are based on both the ob- served intensity (top-right) and the observed and fore- casted structure (center). The intermediate structural forecast is the key contrast with traditional end-to-end DL methods. will offer something neither end-to-end models (black-box prediction of intensity directly from IR imagery) nor existing operational forecasts can: structural summaries or interpretable quantiﬁcation of the convective structure of TCs in the form of one-dimensional functions, together with structural forecasts of the dynamic evolution of these summaries. This new setup will provide forecasters with a powerful tool for monitoring high-dimensional time series of key physically relevant predictors (like the eye-eyewall structure and symmetry of deep convection relative to the TC center) with the means to understanding how the predictors relate to one another and to TC intensity change. Figure 1 describes our approach. In this ﬁgure, the top row indicates observed information, while the bottom row indicates forecasts; the ﬁnal intensity forecast (bottom-right) depends on the past intensity (top-right) and a “structural forecast” (bottom-center) — the predicted short-term evolution of TC structure itself. We obtain structural forecasts via two paths (A and B). Each approach extracts a set of interpretable functions and uses DL to propagate the structural state of the TC into the near future. These parallel pathways allow forecasters to check the structural forecasts for agreement via quantitative error metrics in addition to checking them for physical plausibility directly examining both forecasted imagery and structure. Path A evolves the original IR imagery via DL and\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
