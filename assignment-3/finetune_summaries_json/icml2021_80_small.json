With these, climate model- ing experts will be able to improve the coupling and parameterization of E3SM and other climate models. 1 Introduction Climate models are critical to our understanding of cli- mate change. We believe there is an opportunity to apply causal inference methods to these models to improve pre- dictions. We can understand the quality of a model by comparing it with observations of the natural phenomena being simulated. From there, we can make the necessary improvements to the model, but where to start? Currently models are developed using a trial and error approach, in which a model is designed and parameterized and the result- ing accuracy is observed. For computationally expensive models this approach quickly becomes inefﬁcient. We pro- pose to investigate the causal relationships between features and their weights to better target reparameterization and feature selection efforts. We propose to focus on the pan- Arctic region because we previously studied Earth system model (ESM) prediction discrepancies there (Nichol et al., 2021). The Arctic climate, though important in itself, also has global climate implications. In Runge et al. (2019a), a recent review of causal methods, they argue that causal discovery is well-suited to improving climate models. Nowack et al. (2020) provide an example analysis of a global climate model.

In contrast to methods based in statistical correlations, causal inference tells us whysystems behave the way they do. Discovering the underlying causal structure in data and then comparing those structures from observed and simulated datasets will give us a richer understanding of the differences between the data sources. Commonly, causal effects are determined and quantiﬁed by interventionist experiments, usually in randomized tri- als. Because of the magnitude, complexity, and uniqueness of the Earth’s climate, there are signiﬁcant feasibility and ethical problems with controlling and intervening in the cli- mate for experimentation. For this reason, climate science is largely studied with coupled numerical models. Each model encapsulates subsystems and subprocesses that work together to determine the long-term climate. The status-quo in Earth system model evaluation is based on simple descriptive statistics, like mean, variance, cli- matologies, and spectral properties of model output de- rived from correlation and regression methods (Runge et al., 2019a). These methods can be simple to implement and interpret but are often ambiguous or misleading; resulting associations can be spurious and the directions of effects is fundamentally unknown. In recent decades, a rigorous mathematical framework has been developed for observational causal inference by Pearl, Spirtes, Glymour, Scheines, and others (Spirtes et al., 2000; Pearl, 2009; Spirtes & Zhang, 2016). The framework is largely based on Reichenbach’s (Reichenbach, 1991) Com- mon Cause Principle: that if two variables are dependent, there must be a causal relationship between the two or a third common driver of the two. Most importantly, causal methods identify the direction of observed effects between variables and detect spurious correlations. The model we are interested in for this work is the United States Department of Energy Energy Exascale Earth Sys- tem Model (E3SM) (E3SM Project, 2018). This model is a coupling of atmospheric, ocean, river, land, land ice, and sea ice numerical models. Its goal is to use exascale com- puting to output high-resolution simulations of natural and anthropogenic effects in the climate. The Arctic climate has signiﬁcant direct and indirect im- pacts on global climate, ecology, geopolitics, and economics (Hassol, 2004; Richter-Menge et al., 2019; Smith & Stephen-Learning Why: Data-Driven Causal Evaluations of Climate Models son, 2013). In particular, the volume and extent of Arctic sea ice are important indicators for the current state and projections of global climate change (Goosse et al., 2018; Sevellec et al., 2017; Runge et al., 2015; Cvijanovic et al., 2017). Because of this, effectively understanding the causal drivers in the Arctic climate system is requisite for under- standing the future of our climate and how we can mitigate or intervene in climate change.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy text removed:\n\nClimate modeling experts can improve the coupling and parameterization of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) and other climate models by applying causal inference methods. Climate models are crucial for understanding climate change. We propose to apply causal inference methods to improve predictions by comparing model outputs with observations of natural phenomena. This approach can help identify areas for improvement, but it requires a systematic method to determine where to focus efforts.\n\nCurrently, climate models are developed using a trial-and-error approach, which becomes inefficient for computationally expensive models. We propose to investigate the causal relationships between features and their weights to better target reparameterization and feature selection efforts. The pan-Arctic region is a key area of focus due to previous research on Earth system model (ESM) prediction discrepancies (Nichol et al., 2021). The Arctic climate has significant global implications, and understanding its causal drivers is essential for predicting future climate change.\n\nCausal discovery is a promising approach for improving climate models, as argued in a recent review by Runge et al. (2019a). Nowack et al. (2020) provided an example analysis of a global climate model using causal inference methods. This work aims to extend the application of causal inference to the E3SM model and include multiple feature analysis.\n\nUnlike statistical correlations, causal inference reveals the underlying reasons for system behavior. By discovering the causal structure in data and comparing it with observed and simulated datasets, we can gain a deeper understanding of the differences between the data sources. However, controlling and intervening in the climate for experimentation is challenging due to its complexity and uniqueness.\n\nClimate science relies on coupled numerical models, which encapsulate subsystems and subprocesses that work together to determine the long-term climate. The current approach to evaluating Earth system models is based on simple descriptive statistics, such as mean, variance, and spectral properties of model output derived from correlation and regression methods (Runge et al., 2019a). However, these methods can be ambiguous or misleading, resulting in spurious associations and unknown effect directions.\n\nA rigorous mathematical framework for observational causal inference has been developed, based on Reichenbach's Common Cause Principle (Reichenbach, 1991). This framework identifies the direction of observed effects between variables and detects spurious correlations. The E3SM model, a coupling of atmospheric, ocean, river, land, land ice, and sea ice numerical models, is the focus of this work. The model aims to use exascale computing to output high-resolution simulations of natural and anthropogenic effects in the climate.\n\nThe Arctic climate has significant direct and indirect impacts on global climate, ecology, geopolitics, and economics (Hassol, 2004; Richter-Menge et al., 2019; Smith & Stephen, 2013).
