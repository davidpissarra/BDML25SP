Wildfires cause catas- trophic socio-economic losses and are projected to worsen in the near future. In- accurate estimates of fire risk put further pressure on wildfire (re)insurance and cause many homes to lose wildfire insurance coverage. Efficient and effective prediction of fire ignition is one step towards better fire risk assessment. Here we present a simplified machine learning-based fire ignition model at yearly scale that is well suited to the use case of one-year term wildfire (re)insurance. Our model yields a recall, precision, and the area under the precision-recall curve of 0.69, 0.86 and 0.81, respectively, for California, and significantly higher values of 0.82, 0.90 and 0.90, respectively, for the populated area, indicating its good per- formance. In addition, our model feature analysis reveals that power line density, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), vegetation optical depth (VOD), and distance to the wildland-urban interface stand out as the most important features determining ignitions. The framework of this simplified ignition model could easily be applied to other regions or genesis of other perils like hurricane, and it paves the road to a broader and more affordable safety net for homeowners. 1 I NTRODUCTION Wildfires have caused many fatalities and are devastating large regions, with far-reaching impacts on the environment, ecosystems, climate and human health[1]. In California, wildfires have been in- creasing for decades, driven by climate-change-induced warming and decreases in precipitation[2]. Furthermore, land and fire management have exacerbated the hazards[3]. Finally, population and socioeconomic growth, particularly at the wildland-urban interface, has dramatically increased the exposure of communities to wildfires and expanded the fire niche into regions and seasons with wet- ter fuels that are less conducive to fire activity[3-6]. The combined result of accelerating wildfire risk is clearly visible in California, which experienced enormously damaging fires in 2017, 2018 and 2020. In 2018 alone, the total damage due to wildfires in California amounted to approximately $148.5 billion ( about 1.5% of California’s annual GDP) [2]. While insurers are suffering from a surge in homeowner insurance claims for wildfires, reinsurers in California had raised their prices by 600% during 2015-2020 to make up for lost profits and rising risks[7], due to an over self-correction and inadequate assessment of fire risks. As a result, the passed through expenses of reinsurance have made insurance unaffordable for many homeowners in California. These increased premiums may also exacerbate financial pressures on residents. The California Department of Insurance (CDI) reported a 6% increase in insurer-initiated homeowner policy non-renewals between 2017 and 2018[8]. 1Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2023 Recent years have seen significant progress in wildfire risk assessment framework [9-12], wherein ignition is a critical component. For ignition component of those frameworks, it usually either ran- domly sample ignitions within a Fire Planning Unit (FPU) [9, 13], which are organized to address fire suppression over a geographic area and divided by region (e.g., California currently has 21 Fire Planning Units), or just sample ignitions relying on historical observations[11, 12]. Next, all the sampled ignitions, will be fed into a separate spread model for wildfire spread simulations. After- wards, wildfire simulations will be used to calculate burn probabilities, and then will be combined with exposures and building vulnerabilities to estimate wildfire risks. Nonetheless, the ignition component is not adequately represented within those earlier frameworks. Specifically, randomly sampling within a FPU ignores the spatial heterogeneity of ignition propensity within a particular FPU, and sampling solely based on historical ignition observations may cause no or inadequate sam- pling in areas without historical ignitions but are still prone to have ignitions in the future. Either of above cases will cause significant biases or uncertainties in ignitions, which will be cascaded to downstream components and will undermine the final wildfire risk assessment. Therefore, a better representation of the ignition component is imperative. In light of surging wildfire (re)insurance prices which put many homes under non-renewal risk, an accurate estimate of wildfire risks is essential for affordable (re)insurance for homeowners and in- surance carriers. In addition, from a (re)insurer’s perspective, the risk estimation should be practical in business and agile in production. To meet those pressing and practical needs, here we present a simplified machine learning (ML) based ignition model, which is a critical component of our wild- fire risk assessment framework that is currently used for the wildfire (re)insurance in California. We model the ignition probability in a simplified manner at yearly scale, as opposed to daily or monthly scale, mainly for practical reasons.\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
