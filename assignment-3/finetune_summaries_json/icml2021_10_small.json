Countries such as Peru, 17.143 cases of dengue were reported  in 2019, where 81.4%  of cases concentrated in five of the 25 department s. When predicting infectious disease outbreaks, it  is crucial to model the long -term dependency in time series data. However, this is challenging when performed on a  countrywide level since dengue incidence varies across administrative areas. Therefore, this study develop ed and appl ied a  climate -based ensemble model using  multiple machine lea rning (ML) approaches  to forecast dengue incidence rate  (DIR) by  department. The ensemble combined the outputs from Long Short -Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network and  Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) methods  to predict DIR one month ahead for each department in Peru. Monthly dengue  cases stratified by Peruvian departments were analysed in conjunction with associat ed demographic, geographic, and  satellite -based meteorological data for the period  January 2010 –December 2019. The results d emonstrated that the ensemble  model was able to forecast  DIR in low -transmission departments, while the model was less able to detect sudden DIR pea ks  in some  departments.  Air temperature  and wind  components demonstra ted to be the significant predictors for DIR prediction s.  This dengue forecast model is timely and can help local gove rnments to implement effective control measures and mitigate  the effects of the disease.  This study advances the state -of-the-art of climate services for the public health sector, by informing  what are the key climate factors responsible for triggering dengue transmission. Finally, this project sum marises how  important it is to perform collaborative work with complementary expertise from intergovernmental organizations and public  health universities to advance knowledge and address societal challenges.   1. Introduction    Dengue is a mosquito -borne v iral infection mostly found in urban and peri-urban areas located in warm and tropical climate  regions. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that the global burden of dengue increased eight -fold over the last  two decades1. This increase has been  partly attributed to globalisat ion, climate change  and urbanisation, but can also be   explained by the improvement in local policies to record and report dengue cases to national (Ministry of Health) and  international (WHO) related agencies1. However, most dengue infections are asymptomatic cases or misdiagnosed as other  febrile illnesses, resulting in under -reporting2. Peru is a Latin American country particularly affected by dengue and according  to the epide miological alerts issued by the Peruvian Ministry of Health, all four dengue serotypes (DENV 1 -4) are in  circulation3,4. In 2019, 17.143 cases of dengue (37 deaths) were reported in Peru, representing a 243% increase compared with  20185. The dengue incidence rate  (DIR) by age group was  reported as 34.18% for children and adolescents  (0-17\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
