Mitigating the impacts of climate change requires a focus on reducing supply chain emissions, which constitute over 90% of total emission inventories. In the financial industry, supply chain emissions linked to lending and investments emerge as the primary source of emissions, posing chal- lenges in tracking financed emissions due to the intricate process of collecting data from numerous suppliers across the supply chain. To address these challenges, we propose an emission estimation framework uti- lizing a Large Language Model (LLM) to drastically accelerate the assessment of the emissions associated with lending and investment activities. This framework utilizes financial activities as a proxy for measuring financed emissions. Utiliz- ing the LLM, we classify financial activities into seven asset classes following the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials (PCAF) standard. Additionally, we map investments to industry categories and employ spend-based emission factors (kg-CO2/$-spend) to calculate emissions associated with financial investments. In our study, we compare the performance of our proposed method with state-of-the- art text classification models like TF-IDF, word2Vec, and Zero-shot learning. The results demonstrate that the LLM-based approach not only surpasses traditional text mining techniques and performs on par with a subject matter expert (SME) but most importantly accelerates the assessment process. 1 I NTRODUCTION The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) outline a path towards a more sustain- able future, comprising 17 goals and 169 targets agreed unanimously by all UN member countries in 2015. SDG 13 focuses on addressing climate change, advocating for the integration of climate mea- sures into national policies, strategies, and plans Nations (2023). Despite these efforts, it has been challenging to meet the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting temperature increase to 1.5◦C above pre- industrial levels and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050. Projections suggest a potential surpass- ing of the critical 1.5◦C threshold by 2035 unless significant actions are undertaken Nations (2023). The financial sector, a key player in the global economy, holds substantial influence over resource allocation. Financial institutions, through investments and lending, can significantly impact carbon emissions. Directing capital toward decarbonization aligns with a 1.5°C scenario, and institutions can actively mitigate their climate impact by disclosing the carbon footprint of their portfolios. The GHG Protocol Corporate Standard Protocol et al. (2004) provides a systematic framework for quantifying an enterprise’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, categorizing them into three scopes. Scope 1 (S1) pertains to direct emissions from owned or controlled sources, while Scope 2 (S2) involves indirect emissions from purchased energy generation. Scope 3 (S3) encompasses all in- direct emissions within the reporting company’s value chain, including upstream and downstream emissions. The GHG Protocol Corporate Value Chain (Scope 3) Accounting and Reporting Standard Protocol (2011) further categorizes scope 3 emissions into 15 categories, with Scope 3 Category 15 1Published as a workshop paper at ”Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 (investments) addressing emissions from a reporting company’s loans and investments, often a sub- stantial part of financial institutions GHG emissions inventory. The Partnership for Carbon Account- ing Financials (PCAF) has developed the Global GHG Accounting and Reporting Standard for the Financial Industry PCAF (2022), facilitating standardized measurement and reporting of financed emissions. This process is essential for adhering to disclosure regulations, providing transparency to investors, establishing net-zero goals, and navigating transition risks. However, the presence of limited data, along with other challenges outlined in Appendix A.2, poses a significant hurdle. Foundation models, a recent breakthrough in artificial intelligence, involve large-scale self- supervised learning on very large datasets. Their adaptability allows for superior fine-tuning in various tasks, often surpassing the performance of traditional machine learning and deep learning models. This success has driven researchers to investigate how such foundation models, specifically applied to applications in climate and sustainability can be developed and deployed. For instance, Nugent et al. (2021) utilized a domain-specific language model pre-trained on business and financial news data to identify Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) topics. Similarly, Luccioni et al. (2020) employed a custom transformer-based NLP model to extract climate-relevant information from financial documents. Additionally, Corringham et al. (2021) investigated the use of pre-trained transformers to classify sentences in a dataset of climate action plans submitted to the United Na- tions after the 2015 Paris Agreement. To encourage the development of foundation models for Earth monitoring, Lacoste et al. (2021) proposed a benchmark comprising various downstream tasks re- lated to climate change.
