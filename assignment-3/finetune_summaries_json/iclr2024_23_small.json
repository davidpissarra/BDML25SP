Generative deep learning approaches are suitable for emulating these tools due to their computational efficiency and ability, once trained, to generate realizations in a fraction of the time required by ESMs. We extend previous work that used a generative probabilistic diffusion model to emu- late ESMs by targeting the joint emulation of multiple variables, temperature and precipitation, by a single diffusion model. Joint generation of multiple variables is critical to generate realistic samples of phenomena resulting from the interplay of multiple variables. The diffusion model emulator takes in the monthly mean-maps of temperature and precipitation and produces the daily values of each of these variables that exhibit statistical properties similar to those generated by ESMs. Our results show the outputs from our extended model closely resemble those from ESMs on various climate metrics including dry spells and hot streaks, and that the joint distribution of temperature and precipitation in our sample closely matches those of ESMs. 1 I NTRODUCTION Earth system models (ESMs) simulate large scale phenomena and extreme weather events and pro- vide insights into the effects of human activity on Earth’s climate at the global and regional scales. These models can offer decision-makers crucial insights for addressing the impacts of future cli- mate scenarios on various systems, including energy and land use. Due to the rarity of extreme events, ESMs must be run numerous times to obtain enough realizations for robust statistics of rare events. This poses an issue when considering ESMs’ significant computational demand and multiple experimental uses. Emulators address this issue by producing realistic future climate pro- jections across various emissions scenarios while significantly reducing the time and computational resources needed, since, once trained, they can generate many realizations in a computational effi- cient way (Kasim et al., 2021). Generative deep learning approaches, in particular, have emerged as strong candidates for developing such emulators (Addison et al., 2022; Saharia et al., 2022; Ho et al., 2022b). We extend the DiffESM model (Bassetti et al., 2023a;b), which emulates ESMs with generative, probabilistic diffusion models. We integrate multiple variables, specifically temperature and precip- itation, into the DiffESM pipeline (Bassetti et al., 2024) to model the variables’ joint spatio-temporal trends. Our model generates realizations of future behavior that mimics ESM output, and from which statistically robust estimates of metrics related to extreme weather events can be efficiently computed. We apply our emulator to one ESM under a scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions. In the original, univariate version, DiffESM produces month-long samples of either the daily mean temperature or daily total precipitation. The monthly mean maps used for its conditioning can be generated from other low-cost emulators, such as STITCHES (Tebaldi et al., 2022) or MESMER (Nath et al., 2022); DiffESM complements these existing emulator approaches.
