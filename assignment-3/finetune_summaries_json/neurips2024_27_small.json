We propose an attention-enhanced quantum physics-informed neural networks model (AQ-PINNs) to tackle these challenges. This approach integrates quantum computing techniques into physics- informed neural networks (PINNs) for climate modeling, aiming to enhance pre- dictive accuracy in fluid dynamics governed by the Navier-Stokes equations while reducing the computational burden and carbon footprint. By harnessing variational quantum multi-head self-attention mechanisms, our AQ-PINNs achieve a 51.51% reduction in model parameters compared to classical multi-head self-attention methods while maintaining comparable convergence and loss. It also employs quantum tensor networks to enhance representational capacity, which can lead to more efficient gradient computations and reduced susceptibility to barren plateaus. Our AQ-PINNs represent a crucial step towards more sustainable and effective climate modeling solutions. 1 Introduction The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a significant increase in energy consumption and carbon emissions, primarily due to the escalating computational requirements of increasingly complex and accurate models. This trend, often called the AI arms race, has seen energy consumption doubling approximately every 3.4 months since 2012 [1]. For instance, the training of GPT-3, with its 175 billion parameters, has been estimated to emit over an amount of electricity equivalent to 500 metric tons of CO 2, a figure comparable to the annual emissions of approximately 60 passenger vehicles [2]. In response to this unsustainable trajectory, the research community has begun focusing onGreen AI methodologies and tools like CodeCarbon [3], Carbontracker [4], and eco2AI to quantify and mitigate the environmental impact of AI models throughout their lifecycle [5]. However, the Jevons paradox presents a crucial challenge: improvements in energy efficiency [6], such as those offered by Green AI, can paradoxically lead to an overall increase in energy consumption. This is Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2024.because greater efficiency often leads to broader adoption and use of AI technologies, potentially exacerbating the very environmental impact they aim to mitigate. Quantum machine learning (QML) benefits from quantum tensor networks by significantly reducing the number of model parameters and leveraging the mathematical essence of Hilbert space to achieve more compact representations [7 –9]. Quantum tensor networks, such as matrix product states (QMPS), tree tensor networks (QTTN), and multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (QMERA) [10], offer various approaches to represent complex quantum states efficiently. For example, QMPS and QTTN can encode quantum states with fewer parameters compared to fully connected quantum circuits, thereby reducing the model complexity while maintaining high accuracy compared to their classical counterparts. In a specific case involving the MNIST dataset, quantum tensor networks trained with fewer parameters achieved high accuracy compared to a classical neural network [11,12]. These tensor network architectures enable more efficient data processing and parameterization by exploiting specific entanglement patterns and reducing redundant information. In this work, addressing the significant environmental implications, we emphasize the urgent need to develop AI models that achieve high performance while minimizing energy consumption. We propose a novel architecture called attention-enhanced quantum physics-informed neural networks (AQ-PINNs), which integrates quantum computing principles with energy-efficient AI frameworks. By employing quantum multi-head self-attention mechanisms alongside quantum tensor networks, AQ-PINNs aim to reduce the parameter space, thus decreasing the computational resources required for training and inference compared to classical models. Our goal is to advance climate modeling capabilities and contribute to sustainable climate change projections, all while maintaining high model performance. 2 Methodology 2.1 Data Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a vital tool for understanding and predicting fluid flow in various applications, including climate modeling [13].
