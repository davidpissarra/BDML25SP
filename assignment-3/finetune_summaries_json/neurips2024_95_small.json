This proposal presents preliminary work showing that it is possible to accurately classify crops from time series derived from Sentinel 1 and 2 satellite imagery in Mexico using a pixel-based binary crop/non-crop time series transformer model. We also find preliminary evidence that meta-learning approaches supplemented with data from similar agro-ecological zones may improve model performance. Due to these promising results, we propose further development of this method with the goal of accurate multi-class crop classification in Jalisco, Mexico via meta-learning with a dataset comprising similar agro-ecological zones. 1 Agriculture and AI Agriculture stands as the backbone of many economies worldwide, contributing as much as 60% to a country’s GDP and acting as a source of livelihood for over one billion people globally [8, 5, 6]. The sector is highly affected by climate change due to the increasing prevalence of adverse weather conditions such as prolonged droughts, increased temperatures and precipitation, and unpredictable pests and diseases, all culminating in declining land productivity [5, 6]. According to the FAO [2], about 757 million people worldwide face acute hunger in 2023. Moreover, the United Nations estimates a 25 %global population growth by 2050, with developing and emerging economies within Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa expected to grow the most [1]. This will ultimately put more pressure on already strained food systems, and we cannot simply clear more agricultural land; doing so results in deforestation and excessive use of resources such as environmentally damaging fertilizers and chemicals to increase productivity. Instead of brute-forcing a solution to this problem, we must find ways to use current resources more efficiently. Accurate and timely crop classification is essential for centralized resource allocation, crop-specific yield prediction, and agricultural policy making. For instance, allocating sufficient resources to farmers throughout the year allows planting flexibility and greater efficiency. Also, crop suitability to specific climates is crucial, as some crops require either cooler or warmer conditions, dictating optimal planting times. Additionally, local demand plays a significant role: even if a farmer successfully grows a large quantity of a product, it may not be possible to sell that product locally if there is insufficient demand or storage capacity. Accurate and timely crop classification is therefore necessary for increasing land productivity. However, traditional crop classification methods like on-the-ground ‘field walks’ and manual satellite imagery classification are error-prone and costly due to the need for a human-in-the-loop. Machine learning methods do not have such downsides. These automatic techniques can be deployed at scale far more efficiently than traditional crop classification as they do not rely on manual intervention once trained. Preprint. Under review.This paper’s contributions are two-fold: first, we present exploratory work on training a time series transformer classifier on satellite imagery time series to distinguish between agricultural and non- agricultural land. Second, we propose expanding this method to multi-class crop classification, addressing a critical data gap for policymakers in Jalisco, Mexico. 2 Data and methods All training locations Filtered training locations Figure 1: Locations of ground truth binary training labels are shown in grey. Locations included in the filtered sample of data with similar satellite time series to Mexico are shown in green.Our proof-of-concept work uses a simpli- fied satellite imagery time series dataset, each corresponding to a location with a bi- nary crop/non-crop label. Upstream data sources are the NASA CropHarvest dataset [9] and labels from Geo-wiki Landcover 2017. CropHarvest contains 12 Sentinel- 2 bands, two Sentinel-1 bands, ERA5 monthly average temperature and precipi- tation, and SRTM DEM data on elevation and topography. Sentinel data is processed to contain the least cloudy observation per month, with other observations discarded. The model input is a 12-month yearly sam- ple from February to February; all available data is for the 2017 growing season. We use a three-layer transformer [7] model based on upstream code from Zvonkov et al. [9]. Due to their self-attention mechanism, transformers allow efficient modeling of long-range dependencies in sequential data, making them well-suited for time series inputs like the ones used in this analysis. The model is trained on three different datasets: Mexico data only, all global data, and a filtered subset of the international data intended to capture regions agroecologically similar to Mexico. There are several potential strategies for generating this filtered subset; as an initial approach, we assess similarity based on the satellite, weather, and topology data in the NASA CropHarvest dataset. Using Principal Component (PC) Analysis [3], the first 5 PCs for each pixel are calculated. For each PC, the central 90 %of values found in the Mexico data constrains the allowed values; locations for which any PCs fall outside this range are removed from the training dataset. For each sample, we perform k-fold cross-validation with k= 20. Training data is sampled with replacement in each fold, and predictions are generated for the subset of Mexico data not\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
