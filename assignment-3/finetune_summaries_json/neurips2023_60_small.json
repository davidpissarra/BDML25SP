Leveraging satellite imagery for scenario analysis is effective but also introduces additional challenges due to the complex relations among clouds and the highly dynamic context. Existing deep learning methods in this domain rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which suffer from limited per-layer receptive fields. This limitation hinders their ability to capture long-range dependencies and global contextual knowledge during inference. In response, we introduce a novel approach, namely “Typhoon Intensity Transformer” (Tint), which leverages self-attention mechanisms with global receptive fields per layer. Tint adopts a sequence-to-sequence feature representation learning per- spective. It begins by cutting a given satellite image into a sequence of patches and recursively employs self-attention operations to extract both local and global contextual relations between all patch pairs simultaneously, thereby enhancing per-patch feature representation learning. Extensive experiments on a publicly available typhoon benchmark validate the efficacy of Tint in comparison with both state-of-the-art deep learning and conventional meteorological methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/chen-huanxin/Tint. 1 Introduction In recent decades, global warming has led to both the intensification and expansion of typhoons [1]. Typhoons are severe or even extreme weather systems that originate from warm tropical oceans and gradually build up their own power when approaching nearby lands. Upon making landfall, they pose significant threats to lives and properties in their vicinity [2, 3]. Different typhoon intensities correspond to varying levels of economic losses and environmental devastation [4]. The intensity of a typhoon is closely associated with the maximum sustained surface wind speed near its center, making it a key factor in disaster management. ∗Xiatian Zhu (xiatian.zhu@surrey.ac.uk) is the corresponding author.

Ample studies focus on predictive regressions using the information, features, and parameters extracted from these remote sensing images [6, 7]. In recent years, to overcome the limitations of regression-based methods, researchers have resorted to deep learning methods [8] for estimating typhoon intensity using satellite imagery [9]. One of the most prevailing methods in this field relies heavily on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) [10], which are renowned for their proficiency in capturing local image features and intricate image structures. However, the over-concentration on local information may deteriorate the model’s overall performance as it neglects the global context that is essential for improving predictive accuracy. In this study, we address the above critical limitations by proposing a novel method called the Typhoon Intensity Transformer (Tint). The Tint employs self-attention mechanisms with expansive global fields in each layer. This is achieved by partitioning input images into fixed-size patches and transforming them into one-dimensional feature vector sequences. Self-attention mechanisms are then used for establishing the connections among these patches so as to extract comprehensive global features and contextual information spanning the entire image. Moreover, The Tint further refines and consolidates image features through the incorporation of multiple Transformer layers, through which these features are forwarded to an output layer for typhoon intensity predictions. The superior performance of the Tint can be attributed to its capacity in treating images analogously to text data from a sequential perspective, i.e., it is able to extract extensive global relations and contextual cues beyond the local features captured by the CNNs. 2 Methodology The Tint adopts the same input-output configuration as Vision Transformers[11, 12, 13] with a key difference that it outputs a continuous integer as the typhoon intensity estimation. Overview of our Tint is given in Figure 1. Image to sequence Our method takes a 1D sequence of feature embeddings Z∈RL×Cas inputs withLas the preset sequence length and Cas the hidden channel size. This is implemented as follows: (1) We first cut a given input image into a grid of patches; (2) Then an embedding block is employed to encode each individual patch into a feature embedding; (3) Positional embedding is further added on top of each content embedding. Model architecture To strike a balance between computational efficiency and model performance, we choose to implement the Tiny-ViT architecture [11]. Our model comprises four stages with progressively decreasing resolutions. The patch embedding block consists of two convolutional layers using a kernel size of 3, a stride of 2, and a padding size of 1. In the initial stage, we employ lightweight and efficient MBConvs [14] along with downsampling blocks. This choice is motivated by the efficiency of early convolutional layers in learning low\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
