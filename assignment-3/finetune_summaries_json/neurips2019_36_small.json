Both these ideas were previously published in [5] and [8] and contain further technical details. 1 Introduction Commercial aviation has a severe effect on our climate due to emission of harmful particulates and gases such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, lead etc. In 2017, aviation resulted in 859 million tonnes of CO2, which is roughly 2% of man-made carbon emissions [ 10]. According to some estimates, one round-trip of trans-Atlantic ﬂight emits enough carbon dioxide to melt 30 square feet of Arctic sea ice. Consequently, it is important to seriously consider efforts that promise to limit the adverse effects of aviation. While there are joint efforts in the industry such as Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)[1], they are mostly voluntary, market based and have modest targets. We explore and propose ML methods to optimize for ﬂight time given a source and a destination. The key insight is an aircraft can signiﬁcantly reduce ﬂight time by choosing routing that has favorable winds. Consequently, our proposal is two fold: use machine learning to (1) improve winds aloft forecast and (2) derive ﬂight policies that are optimal for time to reach destination. We propose to use the network of aircraft already in the air as surrogate sensors that continually update and inform about the winds. We also explore the idea of sequential decision making via contextual bandits to derive optimal ﬂight policies. Shaving an hour of ﬂight time on average can reduce carbon dioxide emissions by over 2500 kg, hence the methods described in this paper can be fairly useful. 1.1 Improving Wind Forecasts The core idea is to use publicly available information from the large number of aircraft aloft (ﬁg. 1(a)) to improve wind forecasts. US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) publishes Winds Aloft report for static wind station sites at a discrete set of altitudes. We reﬁne these forecasts by considering how fast an aircraft is traveling over the ground (ground speed), which is highly informative about the latent winds that an aircraft is experiencing at that location (ﬁg. 1(b)). Formally, we use Gaussian Processes (GPs)[ 6] as they provide an efﬁcient updating procedure for conditioning phenomena at one location based on observations at other locations.

In 2017, aviation resulted in 859 million tonnes of CO2, which is roughly 2% of man-made carbon emissions [10].
