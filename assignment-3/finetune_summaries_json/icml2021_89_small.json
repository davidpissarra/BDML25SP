Since at- tention mechanisms allow us to take into account dependencies between time series across multiple dimensions efﬁciently, our approach goes beyond classic statistical methods and incorporates many related variables, such as electricity price, demand and production by other sources. Our preliminary results show that while transformers can come at higher computational costs, they are more precise than classical imputation methods. 1. Introduction According to the latest breakdown of global emissions pub- lished by Climate Watch and the World Resources Institute, the electricity sector accounts for 24% of global emissions, while the energy sector accounts for 73% (Our World in Data, 2021; Climate Watch, 2021; World Resources Insti- tute, 2020). Undoubtedly, electricity production by renew- able energy sources (RES) plays a key role to mitigate cli- mate crisis. Furthermore, RES can help to reduce emissions in other sectors through sector coupling, such as using elec- tric cars in transportation or electric boilers and heat pumps in heat sector. Data on electricity generation from RES is a key element addressing climate change. RES generation data are used in many contexts, ranging from studies of tech- 1Institute for Industrial Production (IIP), Chair of Energy Economics, Karlsruhe Instituteof Technology (KIT), Germany 2Department of Computer Science and Artiﬁcial Intelligence, Uni- versity of Granada, Spain.

Therefore, improving the quality of these data ensure greater accuracy and consistency of research in this area, and will open new avenues for future innovations. Several electricity time series have been made available to the public. Two important examples are the PJM data (PJM data miner, 2021) in the US and the transparency platform ENTSO-E (ENTSO-E, 2021) in Europe. However, compiling these data for a very large number of electricity production units, including small generation such as rooftop solar plants, is difﬁcult and produces time series with many missing values. For instance, in the ENTSO-E transparency platform an average of 1000 values per week are missing in the production mix data for 2015 and 2016 (Hirth et al., 2018). (Ruggles et al., 2020) show that after ﬁlling the gaps only in electricity demand time series, the results of a power system model vary by 5% between using two sophisticated data imputation approaches, even for a very simple analysis considering only one region. They also show that the results from simple data imputation methods are very high and unacceptable. In this work, we ﬁll the data gaps in the data of the ENTSO-E transparency platform, which consists of 32 regions (European countries), and we ﬁll the gaps not only in electricity demand but also in time series of electricity generation such as wind and solar and electricity prices. Time series literature have used different methods for data imputation in the past, mostly based on statistical correla- tion and regression techniques (Van Buuren, 2018). More recently, the advances in Machine and Deep Learning sug- gest that sequence prediction and forecasting methods can be successfully applied to imputation of missing values in energy data (Wang et al., 2019). In particular, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTMs) networks have been applied both to forecast elec- tricity production from renewable energy sources and elec- tricity demand, and to ﬁll in missing values (Liu et al., 2019), (Kumar et al., 2018). In the last years, transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have become the choice architecture to process sequences in nat-Applying transformer to imputation of multivariate energy time series data ural language processing applications. Transformers use an attention mechanism to identify the relevant fragments in a sequence. In this way, transformers learn dependencies between all considered time stamps explicitly. In the case of an electricity system, there are high dependen- cies between the electricity generation, electricity demand and electricity price time series. As an example, the follow- ing interdependencies can be mentioned. In a power system, the dispatch of the different power generation technologies depends on the dispatch of the competing technologies. The sum of electricity generation must always match electricity demand, taking into account storage technologies. In addi- tion, electricity prices in each hour depend on the dispatch of the electricity generation\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
