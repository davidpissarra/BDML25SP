We bench- mark performance against NASA’s flagship post-processed CMIP6 climate model product, NEX-GDDP. We find that our model successfully reaches a spatial resolution double that of NASA’s product while also achieving comparable or im- proved levels of bias correction in both daily precipitation and temperature. The resulting higher fidelity simulations of present and forward-looking climate can enable more local, accurate models of hazards like flooding, drought, and heat- waves. 1 Introduction Global climate models by design are imperfect simulations of the physical world. While leading climate models like those in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) incorporate known phenomena like the laws of thermodynamics, other phenomena like cloud condensation have no known equations and require developers to include imprecise estimates. What’s more, climate models are run at spatial resolutions too coarse to simulate key phenom- ena like convective precipitation, tropical cyclone dynamics, and local effects from topography and land cover (microcli- mates). This leads to a variety of known and unknown er- rors, or biases, in projections of fundamental variables like temperature and precipitation. Climate model errors reduce the accuracy of projections of climate hazards like heatwaves and flooding, motivating the development of bias correction methods. These meth- ods (Section 2) generally involve deriving correction fac- tors to better align modeled historical values with observed historical values.

Indeed, forward- looking estimates of future flood risk typically use bias- corrected precipitation rather than the raw climate model data [1]. To enable local, accurate hazard models requires high fidelity, bias-corrected simulations of present-day and forward looking fundamental variables. Recent advances in AI including in image super- resolution (SR) and unpaired image-to-image translation suggest substantial promise to improve over existing bias correction methods. These AI models can flexibly incorpo- rate multivariate and spatial relationships in ways not pos- sible with existing approaches. For instance, AI-based SR has shown superior performance in enhancing the spatial resolution of wildfires [2], precipitation [3, 4, 5], and wind [6, 7]. Meanwhile, unpaired generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown promise in applications to temperature [8] and precipitation [8, 9]. Here we propose ClimaGAN, a novel SR and un- paired image-to-image translation GAN architecture oper- ating on 3-channel geospatial datasets, incorporating tem-perature, precipitation, and elevation. We validate and com- pare ClimaGAN performance against a NASA benchmark algorithm, showcasing ClimaGAN performance on a lead- ing CMIP6 model over a region spanning the contiguous U.S. 2 Related Work There are several methods for bias-correcting and resolu- tion enhancement (downscaling) of climate variables, but the predominant method implemented in the climate com- munity is the bias-correction spatial disaggregation (BCSD) algorithm. For example, BCSD, proposed in 2002 [10], is the method used for NASA’s flagship CMIP6 bias-corrected product [11](Section 3.4). The bias-correction portion of BCSD is achieved through simple quantile mapping be- tween modeled and observed cumulative distribution func- tions. The resolution enhancement is achieved through ap- plication of Fourier transforms. The chief limitation of the (BCSD) algorithm used in NASA’s NEX-GDDP product [11] is that it is a simple sta- tistical method incapable of incorporating auxiliary datasets or spatial variability. For example, the only data that can be used to bias correct a modeled temperature dataset us- ing BCSD is an observed temperature dataset. However, we know that temperature biases are tightly linked to local fea- tures like elevation [12]. BCSD also implements bias cor- rection independently for each pixel, ignoring spatial cor- relation structure that can provide useful signal for further reducing biases. BCSD also does not permit multivariate relationships be- tween climate variables, despite the fact that most climate variables covary. Bias correcting temperature independently from precipitation, for example, can inadvertently introduce unrealistic relationships, particularly for extremes [13]. Bi- variate BCSD has been proposed\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
