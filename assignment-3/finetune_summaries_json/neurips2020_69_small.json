Extracting climate change information from these sources is an important task, e.g., for ﬁltering content and e-discovery, sentiment analysis, automatic summarization, question-answering, and fact-checking. How- ever, automating this process is a challenge, as climate change is a complex, fast- moving, and often ambiguous topic with scarce resources for popular text-based AI tasks. In this paper, we introduce CLIMA TEXT, a dataset for sentence-based climate change topic detection, which we make publicly available. We explore different approaches to identify the climate change topic in various text sources. We ﬁnd that popular keyword-based models are not adequate for such a complex and evolving task. Context-based algorithms like BERT [ 1] can detect, in addition to many trivial cases, a variety of complex and implicit topic patterns. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals a great potential for improvement in several directions, such as, e.g., capturing the discussion on indirect effects of climate change. Hence, we hope this work can serve as a good starting point for further research on this topic. 1 Introduction The World Economic Forum [ 2] continues to rank climate change as one of the top global risks in the next ten years. Not surprisingly, climate change receives prominent public attention and media coverage, which makes it a fascinating object of study for natural language understanding (NLU). The ﬁrst step in tasks such as sentiment analysis, fact-checking, and question-answering is the identiﬁcation of the climate-change topic in text sources. This seems like an obvious task, which is commonly addressed by simple string matching from a keyword list; e.g., as in prominent ﬁnancial economics literature [3]. However, consider the following statements: Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.1.Compliance with these laws and regulations could require signiﬁcant commitments of capital toward environmental monitoring, renovation of storage facilities or transport vessels, payment of emission fees and carbon or other taxes, and application for, and holding of, permits and licenses. 2.

The ﬁrst six sentences enumerated above cannot be detected using glossaries (Table 3) for keyword based models. These sentences are, instead, correctly identiﬁed using a machine-learned text classiﬁer, BERT [ 1]. However, sentence 7 and 8 are straightforward examples. Very rarely, for some reason, these kinds of sentences are not correctly classiﬁed by BERT according to our results. On the other hand, they are always detected correctly by the simplest keyword based models. Climate change topic detection can be difﬁcult and often patterns are implicit and ambiguous. For instance, while it is implicit but unequivocal that sentence 9 talks about a climate change conference, it is unclear whether the sentences 10 and 11 are about climate denialism, therefore about climate change. Sentence 12 talks only about a scientiﬁc fact: carbon dioxide emissions are there with or without climate change. Finally, sentence 13 is talking about regulations on emissions, however, it is omitted which speciﬁc ones: emissions of oxygen, for instance, would not relate to climate change.
