A clear, up-to-date under- standing of the cause of forest loss and degradation enables decision makers to design and implement targeted forest conservation strategies and policy interventions [ 10]. A better characterization of the direct drivers of forest loss can alert relevant industry and government bodies to the risks of carbon emissions and biodiversity loss within their supply chains and jurisdictions. Using satellite observations and ancillary biophysical and socioeconomic data, we develop a 1 km-resolution global map of the dominant drivers of forest loss between 2001 and 2022 for seven categories: permanent agriculture (e.g. commodity crops or pasture), hard commodities (e.g. mining), shifting cultivation, forest management (e.g. wood ﬁber plantations), wildﬁre, settlements and infrastructure, and other natural disturbances (e.g. hurricane damage). Main contributions In this work we explored different satellite data sources and model approaches (transformer-based, convolutional, and random forest) and and set up a framework for efﬁcient dataset generation, model training, evaluation, and inference map generation. We present the ﬁrst global map of forest loss drivers at 1km scale, characterizing drivers of forest loss into 7 global categories, using a single world-wide model — all novel advancements, to the best of our knowledge.3 Related work The attribution of direct drivers of forest loss is an active area of research and of great interest to governments, civil society, and the private sector. Recent studies have quantiﬁed drivers across the tropics [ 11,12,13,14,15,16], Africa [ 17], and Europe [ 18]. The focus has also been on speciﬁc commodities or regional dynamics such as shifting cultivation [ 19], smallholder agriculture [ 20], cocoa [ 21], oil palm [ 22,23], soybeans [ 24], and rubber [ 25]. Some of the most novel advancements have been in near-real-time classiﬁcation of drivers, enabling monitoring and interventions by governments and forest defenders [ 26,27].
