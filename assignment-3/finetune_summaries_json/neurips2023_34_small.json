To address this challenge, we develop weakly-semi-supervised object detection (WSSOD) models on remotely sensed imagery which can leverage a small amount of bounding boxes together with a large amount of point labels that are easy to acquire at scale in geospatial data. We train WSSOD models which use large amounts of point-labeled images with varying fractions of bounding box labeled images in FAIR1M and a wind turbine detection dataset, and demonstrate that they substantially outperform fully supervised models trained with the same amount of bounding box labeled images on both datasets. Furthermore, we find that the WSSOD models trained with 2-10x fewer bounding box labeled images can perform similarly to or outperform fully supervised models trained on the full set of bounding-box labeled images. We believe that the approach can be extended to other remote sensing tasks to reduce reliance on bounding box labels and increase development of models for impactful applications. 1 Introduction Machine learning for detecting objects in remotely sensed imagery has demonstrated success across diverse tasks ( 1;2) including those for impactful applications like sustainable development ( 3) and tackling climate change ( 4). However, many such approaches use object detection models that require large amounts of bounding box labels which can be costly and time-consuming to obtain, especially for remote sensing tasks that require specialized expertise to label. This dependency on bounding box labels substantially limits the development of models for new tasks and new geographies (5). Semi- and weakly-supervised object detection approaches have been developed to alleviate the need for large amounts of bounding box labels. Semi-supervised object detection makes use of a small number of bounding box annotations and a large amount of unlabeled images ( 6;7). Semi-supervised methods have been applied to remotely sensed imagery with mixed levels of success ( 8;9). Many semi-supervised approaches adopt a student-teacher framework: the teacher is trained on the limited supervised data and then run on unsupervised data to produce pseudo-labels, which are then used to train the student model. Alternatively, weakly-supervised object detection uses weaker forms of supervision, commonly including image-level annotations with no bounding boxes ( 10;11;12;13;14) and points ( 15). Many prior works have investigated weakly-supervised learning on remotely sensed imagery using image-level labels ( 16;17;18) and noisy labels ( 19;20). However, to our knowledge, no works have explored weakly-semi-supervised methods for remote sensing tasks. ∗Equal contribution.

Geographic point locations are highly prevalent in existing public datasets and have the potential to serve as ‘free’ labels for training object detection models. Point locations are commonly collected as part of geospatial datasets and constitute a large portion of the OpenStreetMap (OSM) database (21;22). These point locations can be leveraged as weak labels to develop models with a minimal number of additional bounding box labels, but the vast majority of object detection architectures have not been designed to use point labels as supervision. Recently, approaches have been emerging to leverage a large amount of point annotations together with a limited amount of bounding box labels, referred to as weakly-semi-supervised object detection with points (WSSOD-P) ( 23;24;25;14). A general pipeline for WSSOD-P used in recent works (24;25) consists of three parts. First, a teacher model is trained using a limited set of strongly labeled data to input an image with a set of point annotations and produce a corresponding set of bounding boxes. Second, the teacher model is applied to a large dataset of images with point labels to generate pseudo-bounding box annotations on the images. Third, a supervised object detection model is trained on both the strongly labeled images and the pseudo-labeled images. In this work, we use Group R-CNN, the state-of-the art in WSSOD-P on natural images at the time of experimentation ( 25). Group R-CNN follows the three stage pipeline for WSSOD-P described above but proposes a few key changes to the point-to-box regressor, namely producing multiple proposals for each point to improve recall, instance-level proposal assignment to improve instance differentiation and therefore precision, and finally instance-aware representation learning to handle convergence issues with instance assignments ( 25). Group R-CNN achieves high performance on MS-COCO, but its performance on remote sensing tasks has not been investigated prior to this work.
