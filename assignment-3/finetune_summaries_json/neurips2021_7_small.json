Introduction The vast majority of research on the physical earth sys- tem is reliant on the use of general circulation models (GCMs). These are numerical simulators which evolve an ocean and/or atmospheric state forward in time according to analytically-derived equations (Washington & Parkin- son, 2005).

These differences are important, as the simulations are increasingly used to assess the risks associated with ex- treme weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves and storms. To quantify these risks, researchers must decide which GCM(s) to use. This is a non-trivial choice, as it can cause quantitative and qualitative differences on these risks (e.g. (Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017; Herger et al., 2018)). Further, the biases of each GCM vary by variable and geographical location (Ridder et al., 2021). This makes compound risks (Leonard et al., 2014), like simultaneous hot-dry events, even harder to assess, as they involve mul- tiple variables and possibly multiple geographical areas. Simultaneous crop failure in multiple regions of high agri- cultural output (Gaupp et al., 2020) is an important risk which may be particularly affected. GCMs are improving, but will never be perfect. They can be made more useful through bias correction with respect to observations of the real climate (Bellprat et al., 2019). The standard method used is quantile mapping (QM) (Can- non et al., 2015). This is a simple method where a single value of a variable xobtained from the GCM at a spatial location~\u0012, is converted into a percentile using the estimated cumulative distribution function FGCM.

The QM predicted value of ^xobsdoes not use the values of xGCM in neighbouring locations in space. This means, for example, if some weather event in a GCM has a different characteristic shape than in observations, then QM cannot reshape it coherently. This could be the size and shape of a cyclone, or the position of storms along the polar front. Further, QM does not use the values of other variables at the same spatial location.

Introduction\n\nThe majority of research on the physical Earth system relies on general circulation models (GCMs). These numerical simulators evolve an ocean and/or atmospheric state forward in time according to analytically-derived equations (Washington & Parkinson, 2005). Through the work of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), these GCMs have been central to informing policymakers about climate change (IPCC, 2013). There are multiple GCMs developed by research centers across the world. The latest Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) (Eyring et al., 2016) includes output from tens of GCMs. These GCMs discretize the Earth to simulate it, and no matter how fine-grained the simulation, there will always be unresolved physical processes. These must be approximated, and different GCMs use different parameterizations to do so. Because the climate is highly chaotic, these different parameterizations can lead to detectable differences in the GCMs' outputs (Wang et al., 2014; Maher et al., 2018). These differences are important, as the simulations are increasingly used to assess the risks associated with extreme weather events, such as droughts, heatwaves, and storms.\n\nTo quantify these risks, researchers must decide which GCM(s) to use. This is a non-trivial choice, as it can cause quantitative and qualitative differences in these risks (e.g., Kirchmeier-Young et al., 2017; Herger et al., 2018). Further, the biases of each GCM vary by variable and geographical location (Ridder et al., 2021). This makes compound risks, like simultaneous hot-dry events, even harder to assess, as they involve multiple variables and possibly multiple geographical areas. Simultaneous crop failure in multiple regions of high agricultural output (Gaupp et al., 2020) is an important risk that may be particularly affected. GCMs are improving, but will never be perfect. They can be made more useful through bias correction with respect to observations of the real climate (Bellprat et al., 2019).\n\nThe standard method used for bias correction is quantile mapping (QM) (Cannon et al., 2015). This is a simple method where a single value of a variable x obtained from the GCM at a spatial location is converted into a percentile using the estimated cumulative distribution function F_GCM. Then an equivalent observation value x_obs is obtained using the inverse cumulative distribution function F_obs^-1. x_obs = F_obs^-1(F_GCM(x_GCM; ~τ); ~τ) (1) This approach is limited, as it does not capture conditional relationships. The QM predicted value of x_obs does not use the values of x_GCM in neighboring locations in space. This means, for example, if some weather event in a GCM has a different characteristic shape than in observations, then QM cannot reshape it coherently. This could be the size and shape of a cyclone, or the position of storms along the polar front. Further, QM does not use the values of other variables at the same spatial location.
