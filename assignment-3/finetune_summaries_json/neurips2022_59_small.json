The documents are long and tedious for manual analysis, especially for policy experts, lawmakers, and citizens who lack access or domain expertise to utilize data analytics tools. Potential conse- quences of such a situation include reduced citizen governance and involvement in climate policies and an overall surge in analytics costs, rendering less accessibility for the public. In this work, we use a Latent Dirichlet Allocation-based pipeline for the automatic summarization and analysis of 10-years of national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030, established by 27 Member States of the European Union. We focus on analyzing policy framing, the language used to describe specific issues, to detect essential nuances in the way governments frame their climate policies and achieve climate goals. The methods leverage topic modeling and clustering for the comparative analysis of policy documents across different countries. It allows for easier integration in potential user-friendly appli- cations for the development of theories and processes of climate policy. This would further lead to better citizen governance and engagement over climate policies and public policy research. 1 Introduction Machine learning (ML) systems have already been used to analyze climate change [ 15]. They are able to follow climate change itself as well as develop and evaluate solutions preventing or even reversing the process. ML in the form of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has also started to be implemented to study discussions around climate change and climate policies [ 18].

The system presented in this paper is a part of the latter strand of research. It aims to develop NLP methods dedicated to analyzing specific types of policy documents – highly standardized national climate strategies and reports. In recent years, as the danger of climate change has become acknowledged by public opinion, policymakers, and politicians, the number of policy documents dedicated to climate policy has been steadily increasing (Appendix A). However, after the introduction of the Paris Agreement, a specific group of documents has started to be produced by national governments of the Member States of the European Union (EU) – climate strategies and reports on implementing these strategies. The Agreement (Article 13) established an Enhanced Transparency Framework design to provide guidance for regular reporting on national climate policies. As a consequence, the Agreement has stimulated the development of policy documents having similar structures as they address previously agreed issues. Those documents have been analyzed so far mainly through the perspective of climate policy indicators showing commitments of national governments to limit climate change [8, 6]. In this study, we propose the pipeline (Figure 3) that focuses on different aspects of these documents – the way they frame climate policy. The issue framing has been found to influence policy dynamics over the long run [ 5]. The similar structure of the documents allows us to compare the policy framing in different dimensions separately, which allows for a more fine-grained analysis of policy frames. The pipeline was created based on two assumptions: (1) the number and publishing frequency of standardized documents regarding climate policy will soon increase significantly; (2) NLP methods allow a relatively quick and comprehensive summary of these documents and their comparison. They can also reveal important nuances in how governments frame their climate policies. The main contributions of our work are as follows: 1.We propose a pipeline for analyzing similarly structured documents regarding climate public policy, leveraging Natural Language Processing. 2. We provide an easy-to-use web application for exploring structured results of our pipeline. 2 Data We analyze the 10-year national energy and climate plans (NECPs) for the period from 2021 to 2030 established by 27 Member States of the EU. These documents contain information on how individual countries want to relate to the EU’s critical energy and climate policy dimensions. Each plan was published in English and the country’s national language on the EU’s official website. Only documents written in English were considered in this study. All of the data and information used in the paper, either as a subject of the analysis or to support its claims, are publicly available on this website.
