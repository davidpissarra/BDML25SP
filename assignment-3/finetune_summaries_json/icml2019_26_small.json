Autopilot is able to increase the ratio of alternative fuels (including biowaste and tires) to Petroleum coke, while optimizing operation of pyro, the core process of cement production that includes the preheater, kiln and cooler. Emissions of gases such as NO xandSOx, and heavy metals such as mercury and lead which are generated through burning petroleum coke can be reduced through the use of Autopilot. Our system has been proven to work in real world deployments and an analy- sis of cement plant performance with Autopilot enabled shows energy consumption savings and a decrease of up to 28,000 metric tons of CO 2 produced per year. 1. Introduction Clinker is the main ingredient in cement, manufactured through a pyro process. In the pyro process, raw material including limestone is fed into a preheater equipped with a pre-calciner which directly discharges into a rotary kiln (See 1Petuum Inc..

In order to achieve such temperatures, the ﬂame must be about 2000 °C. There are two signiﬁcant sources of CO 2generated by the manufacturing of clinker. The ﬁrst source is limestone (CaCO 3) that is chemically broken down to CaO andCO 2 at high temperatures. This chemical process alone accounts for 5% of all man-made CO 2produced (Andrew, 2018). The other source of CO 2from the pyro process is the burn- ing of fuels in the preheater tower, pre-calciner and kiln, which primarily use Petroleum coke (pet coke) as the source of fuel. For every pound of pet coke burnt as fuel, 3.1 pounds of CO 2are produced. Figure 1. The pyro process that produces clinker The raw material ﬂows from the preheater to the kiln, and from the kiln to the clinker cooler, where clinker is cooled down and thermal energy is recovered by heating combus- tion air to be used in the kiln and pre-calciner. The ﬂow of air moves in the opposite direction. Fans force atmospheric air into the cooler, which is then brought into the kiln and preheater by induced draft fans at the start of the preheater. Air that ﬂows from the cooler into the rotary kiln is called Secondary Air, while one that ﬂows to the pre-calciner is called Tertiary Air. Our Autopilot system is able to adjust control parameters of the cooler in order to maximize the Secondary Air Temperature. This helps reduce the amount of fuel required to heat the air and material to their required temperatures.Autopilot of Cement Plants for Reduction of Fuel Consumption and Emissions Figure 2. The system architecture of the Autopilot system 2. Autopilot We have been working closely with several of the largest cement companies in the world to understand cement pro- cesses. We worked with plant operators and subject matter experts from these companies to understand their objectives for improving efﬁciency of operation while reducing fuel consumption and emissions. The majority of industrial companies aggregate their real- time sensor and control system data into data historians in order to perform archiving and retrospective analysis of asset and operational data. The Autopilot solution is designed to connect to these plant data servers to efﬁciently and securely stream the sensor data to a cloud-based service (See ﬁgure 2). The system is capable of aggregating this data across many sites, processes and assets in real-time. The data is distributed to the AI and ML models developed to provide predictions and prescriptions for operating various assets to optimize operational objectives while maintaining safe operating conditions. The safety bounds and criteria by which an asset should be operated by are provided by the plant operators and used as additional input to the system. The input data and the suggested prescribed optimizations are also visualized to allow for monitoring and evaluation of the plant operations and Autopilot results. The Autopilot system also provides an Auto-steer mode, which allows the optimized control prescriptions which have been suggested, to be written to the control system set points and directly operate the asset or process. The system is continuously monitoring\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
