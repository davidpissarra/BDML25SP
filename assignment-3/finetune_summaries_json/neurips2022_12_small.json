This enables much faster development of new datasets whilst still providing segmentation through patch-level predictions, ultimately increasing the accessibility of using LCC for different scenarios. On the DeepGlobe-LCC dataset, our approach outperforms non-MIL baselines on both scene- and patch- level prediction. This work provides the foundation for expanding the use of LCC in climate change mitigation methods for technology, government, and academia. 1 Introduction Land use/land cover (LULC) change has been recognised as a major contributor to the rise of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Changes in LULC have significant affects on the carbon balance within ecosystem services that contribute to climate change mitigation [ 9]. LULC remote sensing (RS) techniques are widely used for areas such as sustainable development, crop health/yield monitoring, deforestation, urban planning, and water availability [ 6,12]. Due to the recent curation of large volumes of accessible data, machine learning is seeing increased use in RS for Earth Observation (EO). In Land Cover Classification (LCC), the objective of machine learning is to identify and segment regions in satellite images according to a set of classes, e.g., agricultural land, urban land, water, etc. Typically, this requires a segmented dataset — a collection of images that have already been manually annotated with the different class regions. Creating these labelled datasets is a costly process: time and care must be taken to accurately segment the regions. This had lead to bottlenecks and concerns about a lack of datasets for machine learning in EO [ 1,11]. In this work, we present an alternative approach that does not require segmentation datasets. Our contributions are as follows: 1.We reframe LCC as a Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) regression problem, reducing the need for segmentation labels whilst also preserving high-resolution data during training and inference. 2.We propose Scene-to-Patch MIL models that transform low-resolution scene labels to high- resolution patch predictions for LCC. 3.We explore how different data and model configurations of our approach affect performance on the popular DeepGlobe LCC dataset [6].1 The rest of this paper is laid out as follows. Section 2 provides the background to LCC, and Section 3 details our MIL approach. Our experiments are presented in Section 4, and Section 5 concludes. ∗University of Southampton, UK; {J.A.Early,C.Evers,sdr1}@soton.ac.uk †Georgia Institute of Technology, USA; yingjungcd@gmail.com 1Source code is available at https://github.com/JAEarly/MIL-Land-Cover-Classification Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: Workshop at NeurIPS 2022.2 Background and Related Work In this section, we provide the necessary background for our work, detailing LCC and its role in climate change mitigation, existing approaches to LCC, and a brief overview of MIL. Land Cover Classification Machine learning for EO can be used in monitoring and forecasting of socioeconomic, ecological, agricultural, and hydrological problems [ 18]. For example, in the domain of monitoring green house gas (GHG) emissions, satellite images can be used to track emission sources and carbon sequestration [ 22]. It is estimated that human land use contributes about a quarter of global GHG emissions, and that a reduction of around a third of emissions could come from better land management [ 22]. As such, better understanding about how land is used can contribute towards zero emission targets. Improved policy design, planning, and enforcement can be achieved through real-time monitoring [ 14]. For example, automated LCC can be used to determine the effect of regulation or incentives to drive better land use practices [ 22]. LCC can also be used to detect the amount of acreage in use for farmland in order to assess food security and GHG emissions [26]. Existing LCC Approaches LCC is typically approached as an image segmentation problem. The objective is to perform pixel-wise classification of an input image, such that each pixel is assigned a label from a set of classes, in effect creating a new image where different regions in the original image have been separated and classified. This requires the original images to be segmented prior to training, i.e., all pixels must be annotated with a ground-truth class. Popular approaches include Fully Convolutional Networks [ 19], U-Net [ 23], and Pyramid Networks [ 17]. Existing works have applied these or similar approaches to LCC [ 15,16,21,24,25,28]. We refer readers to [ 11] for a more in-depth review of existing work. Multiple Instance Learning In MIL, data are grouped into bags of instances [ 5].
