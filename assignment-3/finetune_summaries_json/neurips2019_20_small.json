As the volume of cryosphere data increases in coming years, this is an interesting and important opportunity for machine learning to address a global challenge for climate change, risk management from  oods, and conserving freshwater resources. Future frame pre- diction of ice melt and tracking the optical  ow of ice dynamics presents modeling di\u000eculties, due to uncertainties in global temperature increase, changing precipita- tion patterns, occlusion from cloud cover, rapid melting and glacier retreat due to black carbon aerosol deposition, from wild\fres or human fossil emissions. We show machine learning method helps improve the accuracy of tracking the optical  ow of ice dynamics compared to existing methods in climate science. Model We use a stochastic video generation with prior for prediction. The prior network observes frames x1:t\u00001and output\u0016 (x1:t\u00001) and\u001b (x1:t\u00001) of a normal distribution and is trained with by maxing: L\u0012;\u001e; (x1:T) =TX t=1\u0002 Eq\u001e(z1:tjx1:t)logp\u0012(xtjx1:t\u00001;z1:t) \u0000\fDKL(q\u001e(ztjx1:t)jjp (ztjx1:t\u00001))\u0003 Wherep\u0012,q\u001eandp are generated from convolutional LSTM. q\u001eandp denote the normal distribution draw from xtandxt\u00001andp\u0012is generated from encoding the xt\u00001together with the zt. Subscene ^xtis generated from a decoder with a deep convolutional GAN architecture a by sampling on a prior ztfrom the latent space drawing from the previous subscenes combined with the last subscene xt\u00001.

    "answer": "Here's the rephrased text with the noisy characters and irrelevant data removed:\n\nIn this paper, we demonstrate techniques from unsupervised learning for future video frame prediction to improve the accuracy of ice flow tracking in multi-spectral satellite images. As the volume of cryosphere data increases in the coming years, this presents an interesting and important opportunity for machine learning to address a global challenge related to climate change, risk management from floods, and conserving freshwater resources.\n\nFuture frame prediction of ice melt and tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics poses modeling difficulties due to uncertainties in global temperature increase, changing precipitation patterns, occlusion from cloud cover, rapid melting, and glacier retreat due to black carbon aerosol deposition from wildfires or human fossil emissions.\n\nWe show that machine learning methods can improve the accuracy of tracking the optical flow of ice dynamics compared to existing methods in climate science. Our model uses a stochastic video generation with a prior for prediction. The prior network observes frames x1:t-1 and outputs (x1:t-1) and (x1:t-1) of a normal distribution, trained with the following loss function:\n\nL;\u001e; (x1:T) = ∑T t=1 Eq\u001e(z1:t| x1:t) log p\u0012(xt| x1:t-1; z1:t) - DKL(q\u001e(zt| x1:t) || p (zt| x1:t-1))\n\nwhere p\u0012, q\u001e, and p are generated from convolutional LSTM. q\u001e and p denote the normal distribution drawn from xt and xt-1, and p\u0012 is generated from encoding xt-1 together with the zt. Subscene ^xt is generated from a decoder with a deep convolutional GAN architecture by sampling on a prior zt from the latent space drawn from the previous subscenes combined with the last subscene xt-1. After decoding, the predicted subscene is passed back to the input of the prediction model and the prior. The latent space zt is drawn from p (zt| x1:t-1).\n\nThe details of the model, also referred to as stochastic video generation, can be found in [1].\n\nThe images are denoted as Fi, where i is from 1 to 12, and the frames (subscenes) in each image are xj i ∈ R128 × 128, where i ∈ {1,..., 12} and j ∈ {1,..., 25}. To find the next subscene, or chip, that matches the xj i-1 best, we compare the xj i-1 to a range of possible regions by calculating the correlation between two chips, the equation being:\n\nCI(r; s) = ∑mn(rmn - \u0016r)(smn - \u0016s) / (∑mn(rmn - \u0016r)^2)^(1/2) * (∑mn(smn - \u0016s)^2)^(1/2)\n\nwhere r and s are the two images, and \u0016 is the mean value.\n\nIn case the previous subscene moves outside the original grid, a larger subscene is selected (see Fig. 1).\n\nPrevious results also show that applying a high-pass filter on both sides of the pairs can be a feasible solution to increase the correlation at certain areas [3, 2] (see Fig. 2).\n\nExperiment Results and Discussion\n\nWe train our model with z ∈ R128 and 2 LSTM layers, each layer having 128 units. By conditioning on the past eight subscenes, the results of our model on different types of subscenes are shown in Figures 4 and 5.\n\n(a) Persistence model (correlation between t0 and t2)\n(b) High frequency model (correlation between filter 0 and filter 2)\n(c) Machine learning model (correlation between ml and t2)\n\nOur model can also be improved if more physical and environmental parameters are introduced into the model, for example, the wind speed and the aerosol optical depth components in the atmosphere. The first parameter provides a trend for the ice flow movement, and the second parameter gives us a confidence factor about the satellite images' quality. Dropout to particular frames can be applied if the aerosol optical depth rises over a threshold. Furthermore, black carbon aerosols were found to accelerate ice loss and glacier retreat in the Himalayas."
