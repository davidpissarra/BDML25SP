One key factor in ensuring the long-term effectiveness of wind turbines is the reduction of operating costs due to maintenance. Severe weather events, such as extreme changes in wind, can damage turbines, resulting in costly maintenance and economic losses in power production. We propose a preliminary physics- informed deep learning model to improve predictions of severe wind events and a multivariate time series extension for this work. 1 Introduction Wind turbines play a crucial role in combating climate change by harnessing the force of the wind to generate clean and renewable energy. The energy produced by turbines is not only sustainable but also does not result in greenhouse gas emissions, which are major contributors to global warming. As such, wind turbines can help reduce reliance on other energy sources that produce greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to climate change. This clean energy impact can help mitigate the adverse effects of climate change, such as extreme weather events, rising sea levels, and disruptions to ecosystems. One key factor in ensuring the long-term effectiveness of wind turbines is the reduction of operating costs due to maintenance. The importance of minimizing turbine need for main- tenance is twofold. Firstly, it directly contributes to making wind energy more economically viable. Turbine repairs, replacements, and lost power production time due to wind turbine shutdowns (WTS) required for maintenance can offset the economic benefits of wind energy. Secondly, by keeping maintenance costs down, wind energy becomes a financially attractive option compared to energy sources that are more harmful to the environment. This compet- itiveness is vital for the widespread adoption of renewable energy, as it encourages businesses and governments to invest in sustainable practices. Severe weather events, particularly gusts of wind, pose a significant threat to the structural integrity of wind turbines. The force exerted by sudden strong winds can lead to exces- sive strain on the turbine components, potentially causing damage and compromising their operational efficiency. In response to such adverse weather conditions, turbine manufactur- ers typically shut down turbines temporarily when the wind speeds exceed predetermined safety thresholds. By temporarily shutting down wind turbines during severe wind events, manufacturers aim to safeguard the turbines against damage, ensuring the longevity of the equipment and minimizing the need for costly repairs. Using predetermined safety thresholds for WTS is a reactive approach to prevent turbines from operating under conditions that could lead to structural stress or mechanical failure. However, a reactive approach is not optimal as waiting until a severe wind gust is imminent before taking action can still result in physical turbine damage. To prevent turbine damage due to severe wind events, a proactive WTS is needed to shutdown the turbine prior to the event. However, accurate event time estimates are crucial to mitigate lost power production due to premature WTS.Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 Machine learning (ML) can enable proactive WTS by providing accurate predictions of severe wind events. By leveraging historical weather data, real-time atmospheric conditions, and advanced algorithms, deep learning models can be used to predict the time until a severe wind gust reaches a turbine, or time-to-event, allowing for proactive and strategic WTS. 2 Related Work Prior work to predict severe wind events has predominantly focused on leveraging fore- casting models based on historical wind speed data [7]. Training ML models with high- frequency data becomes particularly crucial in domains like wind energy, where the need for fine-resolution predictions is imperative for optimizing turbine power output. Forecast- ing high-frequency data, such as on the scale of seconds, presents challenges in time-series analysis due to inherent noise associated with data at such fine temporal resolutions. Rapid fluctuations and short-lived patterns characterize second-level data, making it vulnerable to unpredictable external factors. Traditional forecasting models may struggle to accurately capture these dynamics, resulting in increased forecast errors. Labeled data provides a means to train ML models on specific events of interest, which can mitigate model overfitting to noise and artifacts. Temporal classification is one approach to predict weather events using labeled time series data [1]. However, its application in practice may be hindered by several factors, including subjective determination of a model score threshold to define event classes. An incorrectly low threshold can result in false positive predictions and premature WTS while an incorrectly high threshold can result in false negative predictions and no WTS. Additionally, the scarcity of severe weather events in data can result in label imbalances within the dataset, leading to suboptimal performance in accurately predicting rare but critical events. Time-to-event, or survival, analysis is an alternative ML approach that leverages labeled event data to predict time until an event. Generally, time-to-event models, such as Random Survival Forests (RSF) [2] and Deep Survival Machines (DSM) [3], require the provision of specific times for the model to evaluate. This characteristic renders these model less appropriate for applications that require high-resolution timescales. Similar to temporal classification, time-to-event models can also suffer errors based on the subjective determina- tion of the model score threshold. Furthermore, assumptions, such as the independence of survival times and censoring mechanisms, might be\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
