This layer implicitly optimizes fairness and controls the spatial distribution of price errors across the system. We showcase the price-aware deep learning in the nexus of wind power forecasting and short-term electricity market clearing. 1 Introduction Addressing the gap between electricity market clearing and power system operations with large shares of renewables, recent literature proposes various deep learning tools for forecasting weather- dependent generation and loads, set-points of conventional generation, and active sets of network constraints, among other applications. Deep learning models learn complex physical processes from an abundance of operational data and instantly map contextual features into informed inputs for market clearing [ 1], and even directly estimate market-clearing outcomes from data [ 2]. However well-informed and tuned these models may be, they are still prone to prediction errors that affect market outcomes for electricity producers and consumers. This paper uncovers the propagation of prediction errors of deep learning into locational marginal prices – the ultimate indicator defining electricity market outcomes across the network – and demon- strates spatial disparity of these errors across the range of power system benchmark systems. To reduce the errors and improve fairness in electricity market applications, we propose to directly incorporate market-clearing optimization as a deep learning layer to inform predictions on pricing errors. For clarity, we use wind power forecasting as the deep learning task, but other prediction tasks may benefit from the same approach. Our results show that even small errors cause spatial disparities in congested systems, with usually a small set of buses contributing the most to the overall disparity. While transmission investments would ultimately resolve spatial disparities, informing predictions with market-clearing outcomes already improves fairness. 2 Price-Awareness for Fair Deep Learning Consider a dataset {(φi, wi)}m i=1ofmoperational records, where the ithrecord includes a power output wiand the associated feature vector φi, collecting weather and turbine data, such as wind speeds and blade pitch angles. The dataset is used to train a deep learning model DeepWP mapping features to wind power outputs, i.e., DeepWP (φ) = bw.DeepWP is a neural network with a fully connected feedforward architecture, and we train it to minimize the prediction error ∥bw−w∥.While standard, this training approach is unaware of the effects of prediction errors on electricity prices. Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2023.2.1 From Prediction to Electricity Price Errors To study the impact of prediction errors on electricity prices, we work with the electricity market clearing based on a DC optimal power flow (OPF) problem [ 1,2]. Given a wind power forecast bw∈Rn, the goal is to identify the conventional generation dispatch p∈Rnwhich satisfies electric loads d∈Rn +at minimum dispatch costs. Generators produce within technical limits p,p∈Rn + incurring costs, described by a quadratic function with coefficients c∈Rn +andC∈Sn +. The power flows are computed using a matrix F∈Re×nof power transfer distribution factors, i.e., the flows aref=F(p+bw−d)∈Relimited by f∈Re +. The DC-OPF optimization takes the form: minimize p⩽p⩽pp⊤Cp+c⊤p (1a) subject to 1⊤(p+bw−d) = 0 : bλb, (1b) |F(p+bw−d)|⩽f:bλf,bλf, (1c) which minimizes total costs subject to power balance, and generation and transmission limits. The locational marginal prices (LMPs), induced on a particular wind power forecast bw,are derived from the optimal dual variables associated with power balance and power flow constraints: π(bw) =bλb·1−F⊤(bλf−bλf)∈Rn, (2) where the first term is the system-wide price adjusted by the second term due to congestion. Remark 1 (Uniqueness).If convex problem (1)is feasible for some forecast bw, then its primal and dual solutions are unique thanks to strictly monotone objective function (1)[3]. Hence, electricity price π(bw)is also unique w.r.t. forecast bw. Hence, the LMP error, defined as δπ=π(bw)−π(w)∈Rn,is also unique w.r.t. forecast bw. Two key observations arise from analyzing Eq. (2). The first relates to disparities due to congestion. Observation 1 (Spatial disparity).In congested networks, for which 1⊤(bλf+bλf)>0, the price error at bus iis proportional to the ithcolumn of matrix Fof power transfer distribution factors. Hence, the same prediction error has a disparate effect on electricity prices, depending on location. This effect under Deep\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
