We propose a method of forecasting sea ice concentration using neural circuit policies, a form of continuous time recurrent neural architecture, which improve the learning of long-term sequential dependencies compared to existing techniques and offer the added benefits of adaptability to irregular sequence intervals and high interpretability. 1 Introduction Polar ice caps play an important role in maintaining a balanced global climate. Perhaps most importantly, the sea ice serves as insulation to regulate temperature, moisture, and solar radiation on the Earth’s surface and in the atmosphere, [20, 33]. Sea ice cover in the Arctic has declined rapidly as a result of anthropogenic warming over the preceding century [26, 28], which has been noted as a leading cause of near-surface temperature amplification in the Arctic [19, 13, 27, 15, 25] and changes in mid-latitude meteorology well beyond the boundaries of the Arctic circle [7, 31]. The melting trend is predicted to continue, with the current decadal rate of decline at 13.16% in September and 2.67% in March [30]. Effectively forecasting Arctic ice cover will prove crucial for communities residing within the region who are most susceptible to food insecurity induced by algal blooms in the absence of ice that are toxic to their food supply [1]. Further, accurate Arctic sea ice prediction may correlate to improved navigation within the region and weather estimates elsewhere in the world [14], although the latter is still in dispute [3]. The most common methods for predicting Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) are dynamical models which tend to couple ice, ocean, and atmospheric data into a deterministic prediction, however, they are highly susceptible to noise in the initial conditions [22] and rarely outperform statistical models at lead times beyond two months [1]. Deep generative models, a form of statistical model, have also had success in the tangential task of precipitation nowcasting due to their probabilistic nature and consequent ability to mimic ensemble methods [23]. The recent wide availability of remote sensing data has allowed the development of more robust, deep learning-based models to predict SIC as well as other sea ice characteristics. The seminal learned models for this task examine spatial relationships in ice concentration using an ensemble of convolutional networks that improve predictions of sea ice extent (SIE), derived from SIC, at lead times up to six months compared to baseline persistence and climatological models [1]. Naturally, subsequent works utilize the time domain and tackle the forecasting task using spatiotemporal sequence models in the form of convolutional long-short term memory networks (ConvLSTMs) [30, 2, 18]. Such ConvLSTM models for SIC are typically evaluated at subseasonal lead times and outperform baseline statistical and dynamical methods under Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: workshop at NeurIPS 2022.Figure 1: Sequential forecasting pipeline. Given a sequence of input SIC observations for a region, the model first uses a series of convolutional layers to embed spatial features before being passed through the recurrent NCP model. The output is a series of predictions at future time steps. two months, but degrade beyond that. This limited performance beyond a few months can be attributed to both the chaotic systems that drive Arctic SIC and the vanishing or exploding gradients that occur while training recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which limit the predictability of longer sequences. In this work, we propose a highly expressive spatiotemporal recurrent network architecture fit to the task of forecasting Arctic SIC. The resultant model structure improves interpretability insights into which regions of the Arctic are most influential in overall SIC, and can also be supplied with mixed memory architectures to mitigate the gradient issues of existing recurrent methods [16]. 2 Learning to predict sea ice concentration 2.1 Neural architecture Neural circuit policies (NCPs) have excelled as end-to-end (perception-to-actuation) controllers in the field of autonomous robotics [17].
