Wildﬁre modeling and mitigation require mapping vege- tation ground cover over large plots of land. The current forestry practice is to send out human ground crews to collect photos of the forest ﬂoor at precisely determined locations, then manually calculate the percent cover of ground fuel types.

In forested areas, detailed information about vegetation is collected by human surveying crews. Vegetation measurements are also heavily used in ecological research projects to establish baseline conditions and track changes in vegetation over time in response to management actions or disturbances such as industrial activity and for monitoring climate change impacts on ecosystems. Documentation and measurement of live and dead vegetation are also extremely important for research on wildﬁres, an important factor in climate change [ 9,10]. The amount and type of live and dead biomass in a location will inﬂuence how a wildﬁre behaves and how fast it spreads. In the province of Alberta, Canada, an inventory program was established to measure and document vegetation characteristics relevant to forest ﬁres. Forest fuels are assessed at different vertical layers. We focus on the classiﬁcation and measurement of fuels located on the ground such as grass, moss, and dead needles from conifer trees. Ground fuels have been largely ignored in forest ﬁre research because it is prohibitively costly to measure them across large areas. In contrast, aerial fuels (tree crowns) have long been inventoried across large areas using aerial photos to document forest tree species types. In this work, we explore the use of machine learning and image processing techniques to extract wildﬁre fuel data from nadir (downward-looking) photographs taken in forested ecosystems by Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.either drones or ﬁeld personnel. We frame the problem of ground vegetation classiﬁcation as a multi-class semantic segmentation task and propose to use a transfer learning methodology using a deep convolutional neural network. Our approach results in pixel masks representing regions of pre-speciﬁed ground cover types. The resulting data allows quantifying variables used in wildﬁre propagation modeling, such as the primary ground cover (e.g. grass, moss, needles, water, rock), the ratios between dominant fuel types (grass, moss, and needles), the presence and ground cover of shrubs, and the existence, coverage, and dimensions of deadwood segments.

However, none of these or similar publications speciﬁcally tackle forest ground cover classiﬁcation using nadir photographs, which involves complex and multi-class images as seen in Figure 1.

Vegetation measurements are also heavily used in ecological research projects to establish baseline conditions and track changes in vegetation over time in response to management actions or disturbances such as industrial activity and for monitoring climate change impacts on ecosystems. Documentation and measurement of live and dead vegetation are also extremely important for research on wildfires, an important factor in climate change. The amount and type of live and dead biomass in a location will influence how a wildfire behaves and how fast it spreads. In the province of Alberta, Canada, an inventory program was established to measure and document vegetation characteristics relevant to forest fires. Forest fuels are assessed at different vertical layers. We focus on the classification and measurement of fuels located on the ground such as grass, moss, and dead needles from conifer trees. Ground fuels have been largely ignored in forest fire research because it is prohibitively costly to measure them across large areas.
