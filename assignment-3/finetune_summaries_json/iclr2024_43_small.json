Whilst many are calling for raw datasets to be unlocked through regulatory changes, we believe this approach will take too long. Synthetic data addresses these challenges directly by overcoming privacy issues. In this pa- per, we present Faraday, a Variational Auto-encoder (V AE)-based model trained over 300 million smart meter data readings from an energy supplier in the UK, with information such as property type and low carbon technologies (LCTs) own- ership. The model produces household-level synthetic load profiles conditioned on these labels, and we compare its outputs against actual substation readings to show how the model can be used for real-world applications by grid modellers interested in modelling energy grids of the future. 1 I NTRODUCTION A huge part of the global transition to net zero involves increasing the share of electricity from renewable sources and concomitantly electrifying heating and transport. Given the variability of renewables and growing adoption of low carbon technologies (LCTs), there are new challenges to our electricity grid such as creating new demand peaks, grid constraints and mismatches between demand and supply. Households with LCTs however can provide flexibility through automation to solve these challenges (National Grid, 2021; Ofgem, 2021; Xilas, 2023; Cheesecake Energy Ltd., 2022). With access to granular household-level electricity consumption data, especially of households with LCTs, we can build better bottom-up grid models of future energy systems to model scenarios, such as varying frequencies of adverse weather conditions or different heat pump adoption rates to under- stand grid resiliency, identify grid constraints, and plan for grid reinforcement projects (Damianakis et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023). Many countries have rolled out smart meters to collect electricity consumption at 15 or 30-minute intervals. Access to this data is limited due to privacy concerns. An example of a smart meter data repository in the United Kingdom is the Smart Energy Research Lab (Elam et al., 2023) which has a strict approval criteria. Calls to liberalise smart meter data for public good (Energy Systems Catapult, 2023) are growing, but they too involve lengthy bureaucracy and strict governance processes. Generating synthetic smart meter data circumnavigates these issues. There is a growing number of literature (Zhang et al., 2019; Liang & Wang, 2022; Gu et al., 2019) that have applied generative artificial intelligence technologies to create synthetic smart meter data. Yet many of them are only theoretical and lack the ability to condition outputs on the type of LCTs that households own. Understanding how different households with LCTs consume electricity is important in modelling grid systems of the future. In this paper, we present Faraday - a model trained using a combination of Variational Auto-encoder and Gaussian Mixture Model. We demonstrate how it has been evaluated and tested in the real world. The model is trained on a proprietary dataset of UK households with metadata on the type of LCTs they own and as such is capable of conditioning outputs by this information. The model is 1Published as a workshop paper at “Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning”, ICLR 2024 currently deployed live as a web-app and an API in closed-alpha phase, available to about 50 alpha testers from academia and industry. 2 M ETHODOLOGY 2.1 A BOUT THE DATASET We have access to proprietary data belonging to an energy supplier in the United Kingdom. The dataset consists of metered half-hourly electricity consumption data of 20 thousand households in 2021 and 2022, alongside attributes such as the type of LCTs they own, the property type and the property’s energy rating. The total number of smart meter readings in this dataset is in the excess of 300 million. The access to this rich dataset means Faraday is able to generate household-level synthetic smart me- ter profiles that are conditioned upon inputs that the user provides, such as whether the household owns an electric vehicle (EV), their capacity to shift around consumption in response to grid con- ditions (i.e. whether they have a smart tariff) and the type of property (e.g. bungalows, terraced or flats). The model’s outputs are valuable to grid modellers who want to model future energy systems that rely on low carbon technologies and renewable energy sources. 2.2 F ARADAY ARCHITECTURE Figure 1: Faraday architectureFaraday is a model based on Conditional Vari- ational Auto-encoder (V AE) (Sohn et al., 2015) and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) algo- rithms.
