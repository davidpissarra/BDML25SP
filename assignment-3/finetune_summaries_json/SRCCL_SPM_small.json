It was the first IPCC report to be produced by  all three Working Groups in collaboration with the Task Force on National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (TFI), and it was the  first IPCC report with more authors from developing countries than authors from developed countries. It was marked by an  inspiring degree of collaboration and interdisciplinarity, reflecting the wide scope of the mandate given to authors by the  Panel. It brought together authors not only from the IPCC’s traditional scientific communities, but also those from sister UN  organisations including the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), the  Science-Policy Interface of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the Food and Agriculture Organization  of the UN (FAO). We must pay tribute to the 107 Coordinating Lead Authors, Lead Authors and Review Editors, from 52 countries, who were  responsible for the report. They gave countless hours of their time, on a voluntary basis, and attended four Lead Author  meetings in widely scattered parts of the globe. The constructive interplay between the authors, who draft the report, and  the Review Editors, who provide assurance that all comments are responded to, greatly helped the process.
