Using a modiﬁed ResNet-50, we can detect smoke plumes of different sizes with an accuracy of 94.3%. The model correctly ignores natural clouds and focuses on those imaging channels that are related to the spectral absorption from aerosols and water vapor, enabling the localization of smoke. We exploit this localization ability and train a U-Net segmentation model on a labeled sub-sample of our data, resulting in an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 0.608 and an overall accuracy for the detection of any smoke plume of 94.0%; on average, our model can reproduce the area covered by smoke in an image to within 5.6%. The performance of our model is mostly limited by occasional confusion with surface objects, the inability to identify semi-transparent smoke, and human limitations to properly identify smoke based on RGB-only images. Nevertheless, our results enable us to reliably detect and qualitatively estimate the level of smoke activity in order to monitor activity in industrial plants across the globe. Our data set and code base are publicly available. 1 Introduction Global warming poses a major threat to the social and economic stability of human civilization. Paradoxically, most of the currently observed climate changes are mainly driven by human activities. The unrestricted consumption of fossil fuels leads to steadily rising levels of atmospheric CO 2and other greenhouse gases (GHG), resulting in the subsequent trapping of heat in Earth’s atmosphere and water bodies [see the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, Synthesis Report, 2014, for a summary]. The reduction of GHG emissions is mandatory to limit long-term damage to Earth’s climate. Being able to globally monitor GHG emissions would allow us to (1) obtain a deeper understanding of its effects on the climate and (2) to enforce environmental protection emission quotas and emission trading schemes. However, the direct measurement of the amount of GHG emissions is extremely expensive, especially on large scales. In addition, legal requirements to report industrial emissions vary signiﬁcantly. A method to globally quantify industrial emissions would improve our picture of GHG emissions, enable their systematic monitoring, and inform policy makers. \u0003michael.mommert@unisg.ch Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning workshop at NeurIPS 2020.Figure 1: A representative sample of example images. Each column corresponds to a different location; the top row shows locations when a smoke plume is present (positive class), the bottom row shows the same locations during the absence of smoke (negative class). Red circles indicates the approximate origin of the plume. Our data set samples a wide range of seasonal effects, climate zones, land use types, and natural cloud patterns. This work investigates the possibility to quantify GHG emissions by using industrial smoke plumes based on satellite imagery as a proxy. The goal of this ongoing project is to establish a pipeline to monitor the state and level of activity of industrial plants using readily available remote sensing data in an effort to estimate their GHG emissions in combination with environmental data. Our contribution2with regard to climate change monitoring is threefold: (1) we compile a large scale annotated data set of active industrial sites with additional segmentation masks for a subset of these smoke plumes, (2) we present a modiﬁed ResNet-50 approach able to detect active smoke plumes with an accuracy of 94.3% and ﬁnally, (3) we utilize a U-Net approach to segment smoke plumes and measure their areal projections on average within 5.6% of human manual annotations. 2 Related Work The detection of smoke from remote sensing imaging data in the past has mostly been restricted to the identiﬁcation of wild ﬁres [see Szapowski & Jensen, 2019, for a review]. A common method for the detection of wildﬁre smoke uses multi-thresholding of multi-spectral imaging data [e.g., Randriambelo et al., 1998], exploiting the spectral characteristics of smoke plumes by hand-crafting corresponding features. With the rise of machine learning, supervised and unsupervised learning methods have been implemented to automatically detect wildﬁres and their smoke plumes [Jain et al., 2020]. Other efforts to characterize smoke plumes use physical dispersion or statistical models [see Jerrett et al., 2005, for a review], or they utilize ground-based observations from consumer grade camera systems in combination with algorithmic solutions [Hsu et al., 2018] or deep learning approaches [Hohberg, 2015, Hsu et al., 2020, Jiao et al., 2020]. While cheap and easy to implement, such camera systems are severely limited in the wavelength range they can observe in and have to be deployed for each site individually. Multi-spectral observations from space can monitor large areas\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n",
