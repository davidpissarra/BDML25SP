Introduction With the increasing attention on environment protection and development of battery technology, electric vehicles(EVs) are growing very quickly in the last few years. The global sales of EVs has increased signiﬁcantly in last four years (Global EV Outlook 2018). The annual EV sales increase in 2018 in Canada was 79% and 81% in the US. Electric vehicles could help to reduce oil dependency and protect the environment compared with traditional internal com- bustion engine vehicles. Many countries and regions have proposed transportation development plan to promote the development of transportation electriﬁcation. It is expected that in China, EVs and PHEVs (plug-in Electric Vehicles) 1School of Computer Science, McGill University, Montreal, Canada2Google, New York, New York, United States3Google DeepMind, Montreal, Quebec, Canada4Department of Electri- cal Computer Engineering, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.

And in Germany, the production capacity of EVs and PHEVs will reach one million in 2020 and ﬁve million in 2030 (German Goverment). The EVs as a whole will cause a high power demand and impose signiﬁcant impacts on the grid. The early adopters of EVs adopting similar behaviors could cause overloading problems for the neighborhood level network. Then for those networks, infrastructure upgrading will be required. It has been a pressing topic for the utility companies to analyze the maximal allowable EV penetration for certain networks to schedule the infrastructure upgrading. This paper aims to propose a framework to analyze the maximal EV penetration for a given neighborhood level network. The proposed framework could serve as guidance for the utility companies to devise infrastructure upgrading plans. 2. Related Work The impacts of EV charging on power system has been discussed in several papers. In (Fernandez et al., 2011), the authors stated that 60% of electric vehicle penetration would lead to a 40% of power loss increase for off peak hours. The high EV charging demand may also require infrastructure upgrading for the power system which would impose a high cost. It would be helpful for the utility companies to learn the maximal EV penetration for an existing network. The penetration of electric vehicle has been discussed in several papers. In (Wu et al., 2017; Wi et al., 2013), EV charging scheduling strategies are discussed for buildings and homes. In (Wu et al., 2014), the authors analyzed the maximal EV penetration with considering both the customer satisfaction and charging constraints.

In (Ravichandran et al., 2018), a chance constrained programming based framework is used for energy scheduling in a microgrid. In (Bruninx et al., 2018), the chance constrained program- ming is used for the day-ahead scheduling of a power plant.
