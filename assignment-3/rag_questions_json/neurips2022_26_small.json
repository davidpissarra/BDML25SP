    "question": "What are the two main factors contributing to the uncertainty in river discharge forecast, and how do they impact dam operation policies in Japan?",
    "answer": "The two main factors contributing to the uncertainty in river discharge forecast are: 1) uncertainty in precipitation forecast (how much rain will fall) and 2) uncertainty in hydrological modeling (how much of the rain will flow into rivers). These uncertainties lead to conservative operation strategies by Japanese public dam operators, which are sub-optimal for hydro power (HP) generation, but may be challenged by advances in environmental modeling and statistical inference models, and increasing social and environmental pressures on fossil fuels and nuclear energy production."
