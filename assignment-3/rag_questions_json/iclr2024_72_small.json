    "question": "What is the primary challenge hindering the widespread implementation of Underground Hydrogen Storage (UHS) despite its potential to bridge the gap between energy supply and demand?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge hindering the widespread implementation of UHS is the high computational costs associated with high-fidelity UHS simulations, which are extremely computationally intensive and delay the pace of large-scale UHS deployment."
