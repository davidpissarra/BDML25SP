    "question": "What is the primary purpose of the data-mining visualization tool presented in the paper, and how does it aim to address the challenges posed by wind variability in the context of increasing reliance on weather-sensitive renewable energy sources?",
    "answer": "The primary purpose of the data-mining visualization tool is to provide an intuitive and interactive way to explore and analyze wind data from different regions, helping to identify patterns, trends, and potential issues that would be difficult to discern from raw data alone. It aims to address the challenges posed by wind variability by offering a deep analysis of the distribution, cross-country correlations, and drivers of low wind power events, ultimately enabling researchers and stakeholders to make well-informed decisions regarding the future deployment and management of wind turbines."
