    "question": "What is the primary advantage of using Machine Learning tools in the site selection and assessment phase of carbon sequestration, and how does it contribute to reducing global warming?",
    "answer": "The primary advantage of using Machine Learning tools in the site selection and assessment phase of carbon sequestration is that it can drastically decrease the decision-making cycle time by reducing human effort. This automated process can aid in screening and selection of injection sites for CO2 storage, facilitate identification of possible CO2 leakage paths in the subsurface, and assist in locating a depleted gas/oil well suitable for CO2 injection and long-term storage. By injecting CO2 into a trapping geological underground formation in a safe and sustainable manner, the oil and gas industry can contribute substantially in reducing global warming and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement by the end of this century."
