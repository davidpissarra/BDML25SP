    "question": "What are the implications of not including smaller companies in climate-related financial disclosure analyses, and how might this impact the efficient allocation of capital during the low-carbon transition?",
    "answer": "The exclusion of smaller companies from climate-related financial disclosure analyses may lead to an inefficient allocation of capital during the low-carbon transition, as significant transition-related opportunities may be overlooked, and investments may not be directed to companies that could benefit from them. This bias could cause the financial impacts of climate change and transitions to be incorrectly priced, ultimately affecting the effectiveness of low-carbon transition efforts."
