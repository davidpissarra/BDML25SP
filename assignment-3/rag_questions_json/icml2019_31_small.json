    "question": "What is the primary challenge in automating wildlife sensing and how can Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems help address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge in automating wildlife sensing is the recognition challenges, which require intensive manual efforts even with the help of recordings and modern signal processing tools. AI systems can help address this challenge by analyzing and characterizing wildlife populations around the globe, enabling accurate and continuous wildlife detection, identification, and geolocalization, and transforming wildlife surveys into high-resolution activity maps that update in real-time and at large scale."
