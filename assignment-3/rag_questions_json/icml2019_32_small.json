    "question": "How can machine learning methods, specifically reinforcement learning, be used to optimize plant development and maximize yield in agriculture, especially under challenging environmental conditions such as limited space, extreme temperature, or water supply limitations?",
    "answer": "Machine learning methods, particularly reinforcement learning, can be used to optimize plant development and maximize yield in agriculture by autonomously exploring and learning ways to influence plant development, controlling environmental parameters such as irrigation and nutrient supply, and receiving sensory feedback from non-invasive measurements like camera images, humidity, and moisture measurements. This approach can lead to fine-grained control systems that can adapt to individual plants' needs, maximizing yield while minimizing resource usage and environmental impact."
