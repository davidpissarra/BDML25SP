    "question": "What is the primary objective of the research presented in the paper, and how does it aim to contribute to the field of wind farm management and power generation?",
    "answer": "The primary objective of the research is to investigate the temporal effects of wind speed-related processes, such as wakes within the wind farm, using the Heterogeneous Graphical Granger model, in order to provide wind farm operators with more inside knowledge and a better understanding of the conditions leading to extreme wind speed events, ultimately enabling them to take action to gain the most out of the prevailing conditions in combination with wind farm management and power generation."
