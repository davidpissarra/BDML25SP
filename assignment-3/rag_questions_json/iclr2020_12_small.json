    "question": "What is the main goal of the proposed data-driven approach to cloud modeling, and how does it aim to address the computational complexity of traditional cloud modeling techniques?",
    "answer": "The main goal of the proposed data-driven approach is to model reﬂectance ﬁelds, which can be used as a proxy for cloud optical depth, a major component of Global Climate Models' (GCMs) energy balance computations. This approach aims to address the computational complexity of traditional cloud modeling techniques by generating realistic reﬂectance ﬁelds from meteorological observations, thereby reducing the need for direct simulation of complex physical processes in cloud composition and evolution."
