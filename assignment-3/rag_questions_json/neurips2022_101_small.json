    "question": "What is the primary goal of the research that utilizes machine learning, ice thickness data, and horizontal ice velocity measurements from satellite radar data to study the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS)?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the research is to quantify the magnitudes and distributions of the basal traction forces that are holding the GrIS back from flowing into the ocean, in order to successfully project mass changes of the ice sheet and associated sea level rise."
