    "question": "What is the main contribution of the proposed pipeline in the context of tropical cyclone (TC) prediction, and how does it differ from the current state-of-the-art model provided by the National Hurricane Center at National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)?",
    "answer": "The main contribution of the proposed pipeline is a twofold: it introduces a new pipeline that encourages transparent and adaptable prediction band development by streamlining cyclone track simulation and prediction band generation, and it provides updates to existing models and novel statistical methodologies in both areas of the pipeline. This pipeline differs from the current state-of-the-art model provided by NOAA in that it is a model-agnostic pipeline, allowing users to easily replace individual components with their preferred methods, whereas the NOAA model is a proprietary model that provides 'cones of uncertainty' through an analysis of historical forecast errors."
