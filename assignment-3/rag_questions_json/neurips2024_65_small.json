    "question": "Can machine learning algorithms be effectively used to model the complex states of pyrolysis machines in biochar production facilities to predict NOx emissions and optimize output, thereby enabling the scale-up of Biochar Carbon Removal (BCR) facilities to over 1000 per year by 2030?",
    "answer": "Yes, a novel method using a standard Random Forest Regressor can be used to model the states of the pyrolysis machine, enabling real-time prediction of production values based on the current operational state, which can help reduce NOx emissions and achieve maximal output while conforming to regulatory requirements."
