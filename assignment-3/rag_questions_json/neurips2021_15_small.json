    "question": "What is the main goal of using a variational autoencoder (VAE) in the context of joint species distribution modeling, and how does it help in identifying biogeographical regions with strong species assemblage covariance patterns?",
    "answer": "The main goal of using a VAE is to identify meaningful low-dimensional structure from plant species presence/absence data with relatively large dimension, and then use this learned representation as an embedding space for application of clustering algorithms to identify biogeographical regions with strong species assemblage covariance patterns. This approach helps in identifying biologically meaningful ecoregions shared requirements across species for survival and propagation."
