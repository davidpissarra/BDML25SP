    "question": "What are the main challenges in assessing the accuracy of land use land cover (LULC) maps, and how can selecting different geographic areas help address these challenges?",
    "answer": "The main challenges in assessing the accuracy of LULC maps include addressing potential bias in the data due to differences in the quality or availability of data sources for different regions or land cover types. Selecting different geographic areas can help address these challenges by providing a more comprehensive understanding of the strengths and limitations of LULC maps and identifying specific areas where improvements are needed, particularly in regions that might have been underrepresented."
