    "question": "What is the primary goal of the proposed workflow for generating baseline housing information using VHR drone images, and how does it aim to address the challenges faced by government agencies in the Caribbean?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the proposed workflow is to provide an end-to-end solution for rapidly generating critical baseline housing information using VHR drone images, thereby bridging the gaps in local capacity to develop and maintain systems for generating baseline exposure datasets. This aims to address the challenges faced by government agencies in the Caribbean, such as the high cost and time-consuming nature of traditional house-to-house approaches to identifying high-risk buildings, and the need for more timely and cost-efficient alternatives."
