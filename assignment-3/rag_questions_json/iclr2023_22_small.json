    "question": "What is a potential issue with using standard loss functions to train machine learning models for predicting outcomes using remotely sensed data in the context of causal inference?",
    "answer": "The predictions generated by these models can produce biased estimates in downstream causal inference if the prediction error in the outcome variable is correlated with policy variables or important confounders."
