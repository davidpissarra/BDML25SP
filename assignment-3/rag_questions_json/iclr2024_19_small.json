    "question": "What is the primary challenge in using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling for uncertainty quantification in land surface modeling, and how does the proposed diffusion-based uncertainty quantification (DBUQ) method address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge in using MCMC sampling is its computational intensity, often necessitating hundreds of thousands of model evaluations, which are not fully parallelizable. The proposed DBUQ method addresses this challenge by leveraging a score-based diffusion model that uses a neural network to learn the score function and then repeatedly solves a reverse stochastic differential equation to draw target samples, thereby reducing the computational demands and enabling efficient parameter estimation."
