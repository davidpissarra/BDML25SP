    "question": "What is the main goal of the proposed model in the context of wildﬁre impacts, and how does it differ from traditional detection and attribution studies?",
    "answer": "The main goal of the proposed model is to create a data-driven, long-term burned area re-analysis to investigate the long-term effect of anthropogenic activity on wildﬁre impacts. This differs from traditional detection and attribution studies, which have traditionally been limited to atmospheric variables, such as the Fire Weather Index (FWI), and instead focuses on the measure of burned area, which is a more complex but relevant indicator of on-the-ground impacts of wildﬁres."
