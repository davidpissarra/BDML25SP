    "answer": "The primary challenge in using ML models for predicting flooding in coastal cities like Norfolk, Virginia, is that they can produce unusual results when presented with data that varies from their training set. This challenge can be addressed by quantifying the prediction uncertainty of the ML models, which can be achieved through methods such as Deep Quantile Regression (DQR)."
