    "question": "What are the main indicators that were chosen to study in order to understand and forecast the evolution of carbon emissions on a country-scale, and why were they chosen?",
    "answer": "The main indicators that were chosen to study are the variables appearing in the Kaya identity: population, national GDP, energy supply, and CO2 emissions. These indicators were chosen because they are consistent and actionable under the right choice of policies, providing a clearer analysis from a macroscopic point of view, and are less correlated with each other compared to raw variables such as population, GDP, and environmental footprint."
