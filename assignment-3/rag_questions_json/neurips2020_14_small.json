    "question": "What is the primary concern that accompanies solar energy, and how does it affect the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced?",
    "answer": "The primary concern that accompanies solar energy is its uncertainty, which is mainly affected by weather conditions. Being able to predict power generation mere hours ahead would help control the amount that must be generated from fossil fuels, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions produced."
