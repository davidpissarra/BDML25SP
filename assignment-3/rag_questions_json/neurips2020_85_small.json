    "question": "What is the primary reason for the high importance of monitoring coastline changes across the world, and how do researchers address the issue of errors in traditional image processing techniques?",
    "answer": "The primary reason for the high importance of monitoring coastline changes is the severe impact on a major percentage of the population inhabiting coastal land zones, with a recent study placing 110 million people living below the local high tide line. To address the issue of errors in traditional image processing techniques, researchers use a moving average based composite image approach, which reduces the error margin to a half-pixel precision value."
