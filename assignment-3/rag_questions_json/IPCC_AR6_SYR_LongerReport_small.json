    "question": "What is the main purpose of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) and how does it differ from its previous assessment reports?",
    "answer": "The main purpose of the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) is to summarize the state of knowledge on climate change, its impacts, and risks, as well as climate change mitigation and adaptation, based on the peer-reviewed scientific, technical, and socio-economic literature since the publication of the IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) in 2014. Unlike its previous assessment reports, AR6 integrates the main findings of the AR6 Working Group reports and three AR6 Special Reports, and recognizes the interdependence of climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity, as well as the value of diverse forms of knowledge."
