    "question": "What is the primary source of CO2 emissions in the pyro process of cement production, and how much CO2 is produced for every pound of pet coke burnt as fuel?",
    "answer": "The primary source of CO2 emissions in the pyro process of cement production is the chemical breakdown of limestone (CaCO3) to CaO and CO2 at high temperatures, accounting for 5% of all man-made CO2 produced. Additionally, the burning of fuels in the preheater tower, pre-calciner, and kiln, primarily using Petroleum coke (pet coke) as the source of fuel, produces 3.1 pounds of CO2 for every pound of pet coke burnt as fuel."
