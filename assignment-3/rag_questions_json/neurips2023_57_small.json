    "question": "What is the isolated effect of the built environment on travel behavior and induced CO2 emissions when accounting for residential self-selection for each neighborhood in Berlin, and how does it decompose into the 5Ds and moderate socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes?",
    "answer": "The built environment causes household travel-related CO2 emissions to differ by a factor of almost two between central and suburban neighborhoods in Berlin, with the effect decomposing into the 5Ds of density, diversity, design, destination accessibility, and distance from transit, and being moderated by socio-demographics and travel-related attitudes."
