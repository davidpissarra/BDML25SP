    "question": "What is the main contribution of the study in terms of spatial resolution and thematic detail of the global map of forest loss drivers compared to existing global maps?",
    "answer": "The study presents the first global map of forest loss drivers at a 1 km scale, characterizing drivers of forest loss into 7 global categories, which is a significant improvement over existing global maps, such as the 10 km dataset from 2018, that are not spatially or thematically detailed enough for decision makers at local-to-regional scales."
