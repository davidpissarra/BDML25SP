    "question": "How does the implementation of Bayesian confidence interval using dropout in an RNN improve the actionability of hurricane trajectory predictions, especially in the context of climate change?",
    "answer": "The implementation of Bayesian confidence interval using dropout in an RNN improves the actionability of hurricane trajectory predictions by estimating the areas to evacuate in the landfall region, providing a more accurate and reliable prediction of the storm's trajectory and allowing for more effective evacuation and safety preparations."
