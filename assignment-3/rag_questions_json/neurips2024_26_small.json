    "question": "What is the primary challenge in using District Heating Systems (DHS) for decarbonization efforts, and how can Machine Learning (ML) based solutions help address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge in using DHS for decarbonization efforts is the continued reliance on fossil fuels for heat production, which contributes to carbon emissions. Machine Learning (ML) based solutions, particularly Deep Learning (DL) models, can help address this challenge by providing accurate demand forecasting, which is crucial for efficient resource management, reducing energy waste, and facilitating the successful incorporation of renewables into existing energy systems."
