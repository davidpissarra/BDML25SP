    "question": "What is the primary objective of the proposed pricing agent in the reinforcement learning approach, and how does it aim to achieve this objective?",
    "answer": "The primary objective of the proposed pricing agent is to decrease the difference between the supply of renewable energy and demand, while also keeping the energy utility profitable. It aims to achieve this objective by formulating the price of electricity as an input to the expectation of future states, taking into account momentary and future renewable energy, demand, weather data, and temporal data, and by using a linear combination of two sub-rewards to optimize the energy selling price."
