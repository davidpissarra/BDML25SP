    "question": "What is the proposed framework's approach to improve generalization and adaptation to other domains in organic matter modeling, and how does it leverage sensor data and remote sensing information?",
    "answer": "The proposed framework uses a domain adaptation approach that incorporates causal constraint minimization and contrastive learning to improve generalization and adaptation to other domains. It leverages sensor data as auxiliary information to capture the underlying causal relations among sensor attributes and organic matter, while also utilizing remote sensing data to provide additional context and guidance on how soil properties impact organic matter. This approach enables the framework to adapt to differing land types and countries, and to identify key soil attributes that affect organic matter, potentially improving understanding of how to optimize soil management practices and standardize data collection approaches."
