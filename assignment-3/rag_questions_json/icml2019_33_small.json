    "question": "Can the deployment of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) in regions such as India and West Africa lead to highly adversarial regional climatic effects, and what are the potential consequences of a lack of regulation in this area?",
    "answer": "Yes, naive deployment of SAI has been shown in simulation to produce highly adversarial regional climatic effects in regions such as India and West Africa. A lack of regulation would allow countries to trigger SAI unilaterally, potentially disrupting the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) and causing collateral damage to the monsoon over India, among other effects."
