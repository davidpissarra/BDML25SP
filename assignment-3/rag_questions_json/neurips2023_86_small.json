    "question": "What is the main challenge in traditional deterministic calibration methods for methane emission models, and how does Bayesian calibration address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge in traditional deterministic calibration methods is that they focus on identifying a single optimal parameter value, neglecting the inherent predictive uncertainties and assuming that there is always a single set of optimal values for all parameters. Bayesian calibration addresses this challenge by statistically representing parameter uncertainties, using probability distributions to represent the input parameter space, and drawing multiple parameter samples to create an ensemble of model predictions, which more closely match observations."
