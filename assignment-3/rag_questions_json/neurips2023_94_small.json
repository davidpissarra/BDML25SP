    "question": "What is the primary goal of the land-use optimization tool developed as part of Project Resilience, and how does it help decision-makers?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the land-use optimization tool is to provide decision-makers with a tool to know how their land-use choices affect CO2 fluxes in the long term, and make suggestions for optimizing these choices. It helps decision-makers by generating Pareto fronts that trade off carbon impact and amount of change customized to different locations, thus providing a potentially useful tool for land-use planning."
