    "question": "What is the main challenge faced by Québec in its electrical grid decarbonization paradigm due to its northern climate and reliance on electric baseboard heating systems?",
    "answer": "The main challenge faced by Québec is that during glacial winter days, electric heaters are all running at once, leading to peak consumption hours, and its hydropower capacity can be reached, necessitating the operation of its only on-grid thermal power plant and import of expensive and greenhouse gas-emitting electricity from neighboring provinces and states."
