    "question": "What is the main challenge in understanding the global carbon cycle's dynamics and how does the Carbon Monitor Ocean (CMO-NRT) dataset address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge is the delayed (by one year) traditional estimates of ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux, which hinders timely understanding and response to the global carbon cycle's dynamics. The Carbon Monitor Ocean (CMO-NRT) dataset addresses this challenge by providing near-real-time, monthly gridded estimates of global surface ocean fugacity of CO2 (fCO2) and ocean-atmosphere CO2 flux from January 2022 to July 2023."
