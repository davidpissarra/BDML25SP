    "question": "What is the significance of ship-tracks in studying aerosol-cloud interactions and their impact on climate forcing, and how do they provide ideal settings for studying aerosol indirect effects?",
    "answer": "Ship-tracks provide ideal settings to study aerosol indirect effects because of the clear separation between dynamics and aerosol effects and between control and perturbed clouds. They allow for the observation of cloud responses to aerosols from ship exhaust, which is essential for estimating aerosol indirect forcing, a key climate driver and the most uncertain component of human-induced radiative forcing to the climate."
