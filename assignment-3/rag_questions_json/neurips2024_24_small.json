    "question": "What is the main challenge in simulating precipitation data using numerical weather prediction (NWP) and global circulation models (GCMs), and how does the proposed method address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge in simulating precipitation data using NWP and GCMs is their inability to accurately predict extreme precipitation events due to limitations in resolution and parameterization. The proposed method addresses this challenge by transforming the precipitation variable nonlinearly into a more malleable variable called pseudo-precipitation (PP), which is a smooth, spatio-temporally continuous field generated by blending total precipitation (TP) and vertically integrated moisture divergence (VIMD)."
