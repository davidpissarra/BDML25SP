    "question": "What is the main challenge in the adoption of climate-smart farming tools in agriculture, and how does the proposed framework aim to address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge in the adoption of climate-smart farming tools in agriculture is the lack of tangible quantitative evidence on their benefits to farmers. The proposed framework, an observational causal inference framework, aims to address this challenge by providing empirical evidence on the impact of digital tools on target farm performance indicators, thereby increasing farmers' trust and accelerating the adoption of technologies that aim to increase productivity and secure a sustainable and resilient agriculture against a changing climate."
