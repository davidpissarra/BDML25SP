    "question": "What is the main difference in the approach to treating uncertainty in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) compared to the Third Assessment Report (TAR)?",
    "answer": "At the time of the TAR in 2001, information was mainly available to describe the linkages from socio-economic information and emissions to climatic changes and impacts. However, with increased understanding of these linkages, the AR4 is now able to assess the linkages in both directions, i.e., to evaluate possible development pathways and global emissions constraints that would reduce the risk of future impacts that society may wish to avoid."
