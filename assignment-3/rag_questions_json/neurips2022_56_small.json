    "question": "What is the main challenge in reconciling company-level emissions with industry, national, and global GHG estimates, and how does this challenge impact decarbonization efforts?",
    "answer": "The main challenge is the large data gap in corporate emissions, which makes it difficult to assess decarbonization efforts accurately. This gap poses problems in tracking and corroborating companies' emissions claims, evaluating carbon performance and carbon risk, and funneling investments towards companies making true efforts to decarbonize."
