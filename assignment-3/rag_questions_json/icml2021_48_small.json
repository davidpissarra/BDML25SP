    "question": "What is the primary challenge associated with solar energy generation that can be mitigated by accurate near-term solar forecasts?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge associated with solar energy generation that can be mitigated by accurate near-term solar forecasts is the uncertainty associated with solar, which has a potentially infinite ramp rate, and the need for utilities to keep conventional generators on'spinning reserve' to compensate for the rise or drop in solar generation, thereby increasing energy's cost and carbon emissions."
