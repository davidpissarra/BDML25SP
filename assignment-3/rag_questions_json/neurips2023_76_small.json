    "question": "Can self-supervised learning be applied to Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to improve the timeliness and accuracy of climate change monitoring, and if so, what are the benefits of this approach?",
    "answer": "Yes, self-supervised learning can be applied to SAR data to improve the timeliness and accuracy of climate change monitoring. The use of masked autoencoding, a self-supervised pretraining scheme, on large-scale SAR data covering 8.7% of the Earth's land surface area, reduces labelling requirements for downstream tasks by more than an order of magnitude and generalises geographically, allowing for the development of task and region-specific SAR models that can be deployed for rapid, accurate monitoring of climate change effects."
