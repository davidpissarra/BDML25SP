    "question": "What is the primary focus of this study, and how does it contribute to the existing body of research on energy burden and climate change?",
    "answer": "The primary focus of this study is to investigate the implications of energy burden beyond energy use, social demographics, and income, and to develop a data-driven framework to identify energy burden indicators that are flexible to new inputs or different geographic regions. This study contributes to the existing body of research by being one of the first to include environmental justice indicators and resiliency measures, and by posing to answer the question 'What indicators are important in developing well-informed policies for energy burdened areas?'"
