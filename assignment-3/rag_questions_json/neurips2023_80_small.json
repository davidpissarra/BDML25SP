    "question": "What is the primary goal of the proposed machine learning approach in the context of climate modeling, and how does it aim to address the limitations of high-resolution simulations like ICON-LEM?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the proposed machine learning approach is to predict autoconversion rates, a crucial step in precipitation formation, while significantly reducing the need for a large number of labeled instances. It aims to address the limitations of high-resolution simulations like ICON-LEM by leveraging active learning techniques and machine learning to minimize the number of labeled instances required, thus reducing overall costs and computational expenses."
