    "question": "What is the key difference between incremental adaptation and transformational adaptation in the context of climate change?",
    "answer": "Incremental adaptation maintains the essence and integrity of a system or process at a given scale, whereas transformational adaptation changes the fundamental attributes of a social-ecological system in anticipation of climate change and its impacts, often requiring system-wide change or changes across more than one system."
