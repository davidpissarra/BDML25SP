    "question": "What is the main objective of the proposed multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for managing energy transactions in microgrids, and how does it address the challenges of energy availability, cost affordability, and pollution controllability?",
    "answer": "The main objective of the proposed framework is to optimize the usage of available resources by minimizing the carbon footprint while benefiting all stakeholders. It addresses the challenges of energy availability, cost affordability, and pollution controllability by minimizing the total energy cost, decreasing the carbon impact, and balancing the consumption and production of both renewable and conventional energy, while also taking into account fluctuations in energy demand and supply."
