    "question": "What is the primary goal of the newly launched four-years project described in the proposal paper, and how will it be achieved?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the project is to develop new artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical modeling tools to contribute to the understanding of the structure, functioning, and underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the global ocean symbiome and its relation with climate change. This will be achieved through a scientific cohort approach, where multi-disciplinary teams collaborate to bring the best of different scientific areas, including state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, machine learning, applied math, modeling, and simulation, and marine biology and oceanography."
