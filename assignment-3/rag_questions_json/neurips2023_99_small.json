    "question": "What is the key innovation in the proposed method for resource-efficient self-supervised representation learning using ERA5 data, and how does it improve upon traditional methods?",
    "answer": "The key innovation is the use of higher-order sampling, where subtensors are sampled along all three spatial or four dimensions, rather than just the horizontal dimensions, allowing for more efficient use of GPU memory and enabling the model to generalize to unseen dimension values through the use of a learnable position encoder."
