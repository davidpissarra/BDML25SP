    "question": "What is the significance of dead trees in forest ecosystems, and how do they contribute to the global carbon cycle?",
    "answer": "Dead trees are a key indicator of forest health, housing one-third of forest ecosystem biodiversity, and constitute 8% of the global carbon stocks. They play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle, sequestering as much CO2 as all of the oceans, and their decomposition by natural factors such as climate, fungi, and insects is a critical component of forest carbon dynamics."
