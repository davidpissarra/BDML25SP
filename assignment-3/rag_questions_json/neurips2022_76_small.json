    "question": "What is the primary goal of the research project described in the text, and how does the proposed approach differ from traditional climate modeling methods?",
    "answer": "The primary goal of the research project is to replace the ozone chemistry in climate models with a machine-learned neural representation of the stratospheric ozone chemistry. This approach differs from traditional climate modeling methods by using a neural network to learn a function that predicts 24-hour ozone tendencies based on input variables, allowing for a faster and more accurate simulation."
