    "question": "What are the main contributions of the proposed AI-based platform for monitoring climate change adaptation (CCA) interventions in the agri-food sector, and how does it differ from the existing SEIRS platform?",
    "answer": "The main contributions of the proposed platform are i) ingesting and processing variety sources of SRS data with a considerable record (> 5 years) of vegetation greenness and precipitation, ii) operating an end-to-end system by exploiting AI-based models suited to time series analysis such as Seq2Seq and Transformers, and iii) providing customised proxies informing the success or failure of a given local CCA intervention(s). The proposed platform differs from the existing SEIRS platform in that it will ingest and process multi-source satellite time series data, utilise AI-based models that can handle corrupt and incomplete data, and provide new NDVI-derived products suited to indicate the status of a local CCA intervention."
