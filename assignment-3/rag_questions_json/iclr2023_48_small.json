    "question": "What is the main challenge in implementing an adaptive control system for energy sharing in a local DC-based microgrid system, and how can reinforcement learning address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge is the varying energy usage patterns of different households, which makes it difficult to fine-tune a fixed rule-based policy for energy sharing. Reinforcement learning can address this challenge by enabling the system to adapt to changing conditions and make decisions in real-time, thereby optimizing energy management and minimizing waste."
