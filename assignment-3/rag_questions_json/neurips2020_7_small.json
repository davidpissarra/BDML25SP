    "question": "What is the main goal of the proposed ConvMOS approach in the context of model output statistics (MOS) for climate models, and how does it differ from other MOS approaches?",
    "answer": "The main goal of the proposed ConvMOS approach is to reduce systematic errors in climate model outputs, particularly for precipitation, by using a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture specifically designed for climate MOS. This approach differs from other MOS methods, such as local scaling and non-local MOS with machine learning models, by leveraging the ability of CNNs to learn spatial patterns in geospatial data, which is well-suited for reducing systematic errors in climate models."
