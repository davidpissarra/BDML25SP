    "question": "What is the primary effect of an increase in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) on cloud droplet size, and how does this impact the Earth's climate?",
    "answer": "An increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r e), leading to brighter, more expansive, and longer-lasting clouds that reflect more incoming sunlight, thus cooling the Earth."
