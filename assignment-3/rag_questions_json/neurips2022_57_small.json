    "question": "What is the main challenge in implementing energy-efficient technologies to reduce energy consumption, as identified by previous literature, and how can machine learning be used to address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge is the Jevons paradox (JP) and optimism bias (OB) in consumer behavior, which can lead to an increase in energy consumption despite the introduction of energy-efficient technologies. Machine learning can be used to identify the dependence of total energy consumption on energy star ratings for each electrical appliance and to develop an index to estimate the varying influence of JP and OB on individual households."
