    "question": "What are the different scopes of carbon accounting in the context of supply chain management, and how do they differ in terms of location and market-based approaches?",
    "answer": "In the context of supply chain management, carbon accounting typically involves three scopes: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3. Scope 1 refers to direct greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources, such as factories and buildings, as well as mobile sources, like vehicles. Scope 2 includes indirect emissions from the production of purchased electricity, heat, or steam. Scope 3 encompasses all other indirect emissions, including those from suppliers, customers, and the entire supply chain. Location-based approaches focus on emissions from specific locations, such as a factory or a vehicle, while market-based approaches consider the emissions associated with the production and transportation of goods and services, regardless of location."
