    "question": "What is the primary challenge in detecting CO2 leakage from underground reservoirs during carbon capture and sequestration, and how can it be addressed using machine learning?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge is the inherently weak and noisy amplitudes of the CO2 reservoir's response in seismic images, making it difficult to detect potential irregularities such as CO2 plumes. This can be addressed using machine learning-based detection methods, such as binary classification, which can efficiently and accurately detect CO2 from realistic seismic images recovered by advanced seismic imaging techniques like the joint recovery model (JRM)."
