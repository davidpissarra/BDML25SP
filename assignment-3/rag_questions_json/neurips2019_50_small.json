    "question": "What is the primary challenge in detecting methane seeps in the permafrost region using existing space-based remote sensing solutions?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge is that the seeps of interest are undetectable by existing space-based remote sensing solutions due to their low sensitivity and resolution, with Sentinel-5P having a resolution of several kilometers and GHGSat's Claire having a 50-meter resolution but above the threshold typical for flow rates in the permafrost."
