    "question": "What is the main goal of the proposed FL TRPO model in the context of smart grid applications, and how does it address the challenges of linear models in this domain?",
    "answer": "The main goal of the proposed FL TRPO model is to reduce energy-associated emissions and costs by combining Federated Learning (FL) with Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO), which aims to capture latent interconnections and employ personalized encoding methods to capture unique insights and relationships between features, thereby generalizing to previously unseen data and addressing the limitations of linear models in handling disparate data distributions and interdependencies among features in smart grid applications."
