    "question": "How can machine learning (ML) tools be used to efficiently allocate energy assistance subsidies to communities that need them most, given the challenges of measuring inequity in the energy system and the limited scalability of current solutions?",
    "answer": "Machine learning tools can be leveraged to develop scalable, replicable, and practical solutions to improve justice in the current energy system and ensure an equitable transition of energy systems. By analyzing public data and applying ML techniques, policymakers can identify the communities that need energy assistance subsidies the most and allocate funds efficiently, promoting green growth, reducing pollution, and encouraging decentralized energy ownership and community representation."
