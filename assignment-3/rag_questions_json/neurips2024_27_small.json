    "question": "What is the primary challenge that the Jevons paradox presents in the context of Green AI methodologies and tools, and how does it relate to the environmental impact of AI models?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge presented by the Jevons paradox is that improvements in energy efficiency, such as those offered by Green AI, can paradoxically lead to an overall increase in energy consumption. This is because greater efficiency often leads to broader adoption and use of AI technologies, potentially exacerbating the very environmental impact they aim to mitigate."
