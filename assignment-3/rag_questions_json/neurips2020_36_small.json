    "question": "What is the primary focus of the proposed behavior detection framework in the context of underwater videos, and how does it differ from previous works in the field of automatic interpretation of underwater imagery?",
    "answer": "The primary focus of the proposed behavior detection framework is to identify startle motion patterns observed in sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) using a novel end-to-end approach that considers 4-second clips, detects the presence of sablefish using DL-based object detectors, determines trajectory tracks, measures behavior-specific features, and employs LSTM networks to determine the presence of startle behavior. This differs from previous works in the field, which have primarily focused on the detection and counting of individual specimens, whereas the proposed framework aims to provide context-aware identification of fish behavior, including complex insights such as predation events, aggressive interactions, and reproduction activities."
