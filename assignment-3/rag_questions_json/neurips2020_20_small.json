    "question": "What is the primary challenge in effectively reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector, and how can machine learning address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge is the stochastic and time-variant nature of methane emissions across geographically sparse sites, making leak detection difficult. Machine learning can address this challenge by identifying'super-emitter' sites without requiring explicit delineation of the relationship between exogenous variables and methane emissions, and by addressing the imbalanced dataset problem typically seen in oil and gas methane emissions distributions."
