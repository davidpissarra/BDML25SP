    "answer": "The main challenge in using traditional deterministic regression models for downscaling tasks is their inability to capture fine-scale stochastic atmospheric processes due to low-frequency spectral bias. The proposed TAUDiff model addresses this issue by integrating a video prediction model for dynamically consistent mean-field downscaling and a smaller guided denoising diffusion model for stochastically generating the fine-scale features."
