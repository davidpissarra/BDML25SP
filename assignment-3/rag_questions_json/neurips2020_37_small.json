    "question": "What is the main driver of deforestation in the Amazon region, and how does it contribute to global warming?",
    "answer": "Cattle ranching is the main driver of deforestation in the Amazon region, and it contributes to global warming by releasing methane due to the digestion process of cattle, demanding massive regions to be deforested for grazing areas, and releasing carbon stored in the forest, which further accelerates the ongoing 6th mass extinction of species and compounds the effects of global warming."
