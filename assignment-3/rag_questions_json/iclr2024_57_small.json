    "question": "Can the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) method effectively identify the complex dynamics of power grid frequency, including non-linearity, noise, and time-dependent behavior, in systems such as those found in Iceland, Ireland, and the Balearic islands?",
    "answer": "Yes, the SINDy method can identify the complex dynamics of power grid frequency, including non-linearity, noise, and time-dependent behavior, as demonstrated by the authors in their study, which leverages the method to derive linear and nonlinear differential models of the power grid frequency from data measurements."
