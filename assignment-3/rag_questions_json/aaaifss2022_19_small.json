    "question": "What is the primary challenge in achieving long-term cooperation on climate change mitigation among nations, and how can machine learning be used to address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge is that there is no central authority to enforce adherence to climate agreements, making it essential to design negotiation and agreement frameworks that foster cooperation and incentivize long-term adherence. Machine learning can be used to address this challenge by providing a critical tool to simulate the global climate and economy, and to train rational agents using multi-agent reinforcement learning to design and evaluate strategic outcomes for different negotiation and agreement frameworks."
