    "question": "What is the primary challenge faced by Alaska in terms of energy management, and how does the proposed framework address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The primary challenge faced by Alaska is the lack of granular, large-scale data on building energy demands, which is essential for decarbonization efforts in supporting climate change mitigation. The proposed framework addresses this challenge by introducing an ethical framework that leverages machine learning and geospatial techniques to enable the large-scale integration of data, facilitating the mapping of energy consumption data at the individual building level."
