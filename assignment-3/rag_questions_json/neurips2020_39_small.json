    "question": "How can machine learning techniques be used to address the challenge of strong surface artifacts in diamond wire sawing (DWS) wafer images, which are not suitable for quality inspection using conventional methods?",
    "answer": "Adversarial networks, specifically a ResidualGAN, can be used to denoise the images and remove the artifacts, allowing for quality inspection and process optimization in DWS wafering."
