    "question": "What is the main challenge in using the SDG Interlinkages Analysis & Visualisation Tool developed by the Institute for Global Environmental Strategies (IGES) for identifying and quantifying SDG interlinkages?",
    "answer": "The main challenge is the lack of well-defined evidence on the causations between SDG targets, which is due to the tool's current literature review being conducted manually based on a limited amount of literature, making it difficult to systematically capture the full range of SDG interactions."
