    "question": "What are the potential risks of land degradation associated with the large-scale implementation of land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies, as discussed in Chapter 4 of the IPCC special report on climate change, desertification, land degradation, sustainable land management, food security, and greenhouse gas fluxes in terrestrial ecosystems?",
    "answer": "The potential risks of land degradation associated with the large-scale implementation of land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) technologies include the risk of land degradation itself, as discussed in section 4.5.2 of the report, which highlights the need for careful consideration of the potential impacts of these technologies on land health and ecosystem services."
