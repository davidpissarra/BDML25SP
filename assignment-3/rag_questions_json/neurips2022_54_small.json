    "question": "What is the primary source of transportation sector emissions, and how do current methods for estimating road transportation emissions have limitations?",
    "answer": "The primary source of transportation sector emissions are on-road vehicles, accounting for approximately 74% of global transportation emissions in 2018. Current methods for estimating road transportation emissions have limitations, including the reliance on vehicle traffic and road data that is not always readily available, and the use of proxies such as road density, which can lead to inaccurate estimates, especially in urban centers."
