    "question": "What is the main challenge in developing electrochemical ammonia production methods, and how can machine learning models help address this challenge?",
    "answer": "The main challenge in developing electrochemical ammonia production methods is the discovery of electrode catalysts that are preferentially selective for adsorption of nitrogen and its reduction intermediates over adsorption of oxygen or hydrogen, as well as finding combinations of membrane and electrode materials that have high ammonia yields per area/time, good Faradaic efficiency, and are stable. Machine learning models can help address this challenge by rapidly predicting relevant materials properties, such as relative adsorption energies, melting point, ion-conductivity, and reactivity, which can be used to screen the space of plausible materials and identify potential candidates for electrochemical ammonia production."
